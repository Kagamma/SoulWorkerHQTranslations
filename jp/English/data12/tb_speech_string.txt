What is it for here?\nDid you lose something?

ID=101228
Thank you for having trouble for my upgrade.

ID=101229
It is strange to see you in such a place.\nDid you lose something?

ID=101230
We have completed collection of lost objects.

ID=101231
......

ID=101232
Help me ... Thank you ... Thank you ....

ID=101233
I'm very pleased that we were able to meet again.\nIt is a cleaning robot "Cleanie".

Oh, have you got up already?\nYou may as well be young after all.

ID=210000502
Miriam.\nNice to meet you ... right?

ID=210000503
%username% ... Is not it?

ID=210000504
Student card. I saw it. Heh.\nI was feeling really nervous.

ID=210000505
......

ID=210000506
Well ... Where is this wonderful older sister in front of you,\nWhat on earth is going on ... What do you want to ask?

ID=210000507
I will explain it to you one by one, so I'm not impatient.

ID=210000508
There is nothing you can hurry. Just hurry.

ID=210000509
Anyway, please follow me.\nCan you walk?

ID=510000501
I will have a simple test from now.

ID=510000502
It is a test to check whether the recognition reaction is normal or not.\nWell ... I thought it was a school physical examination.

ID=510000503
Let's relax and relax.

ID=210000701
A bad old man who lives there ... Do you understand?\nFrom that uncle, listen to the detailed explanation about the test.

ID=210000702
It will pretty threaten ....\nIt's just fine, you do not have to be afraid.

ID=610000701
... You can not believe it even if you awake, do you?\nI guess I'm still dreaming.

ID=610000702
But ... reality.\nall.

ID=610000703
Did you remember?\nThe scenery I saw the first time when I fell out of the blanks and that wolf ....

ID=610000704
Accept the reality soon.\nIf not, it will die.

ID=610000705
... Oh.\nI scared the other way while telling me not to be scared. Hehuhu.

ID=610000706
Anyway, after a detailed talk later.\nIt is a test now. Good?

ID=310000701
Take an explanation from a scared face man over there.

ID=100007101
It took quite some time.\nWell content of the story is generally predictable.

ID=100007102
I am Benjamin.\nHere he is responsible for directing the Star Forest Alliance stationed in Steel Grave.

ID=100007103
I think that there was explanation from Miriam,\nI will supplement a little.

ID=100007104
The management and monitoring of the disinterested person like you who fell from the blank,\nIt is one of the main duties of the Star Forest Alliance.\nOriginally it only ends with a simple profile check ....

ID=100007105
This is the first time for patterns like this one. Although it is unusual, it was decided to carry out a test.

ID=100007106
Different people basically do not use weapons.\nThe ability to stay in the body itself is like a strong weapon.

ID=100007107
But you seem to use weapons.\nMoreover, with the power to overwhelm the other proficient person ....

ID=100007108
That wolf you defeated earlier is a special individual called a wake-up body.\nIt was an opponent that I could not suppress very much at that time 's military strength.

ID=100007109
I knocked it down.\nJust one person.

ID=100007110
For us we need to find out how much power you have.\nIt's a test for that. Can you cooperate?

ID=100007111
... I will advise you once, but let's stop funny behavior.\nI hope to become a target for bullets for opponent.

ID=100007112
The test room is in the back.\nIf you put it in, the exclusive operator will support it.

ID=100007113
You can easily break through as long as you follow the instructions of the operator.\nI hope that you will do it seriously.

ID=100007114
Well, see you later.

ID=100007115
I think that it might be good to give it more gentle?\nIs there also a problem?

ID=100007116
......

ID=100007117
I just awoke. Everything is the first time, there are also many uneasiness.\nNevertheless, that idiot speaks with a scoop and a foot soak.

ID=100007118
......

ID=100007119
Hey, Major ... are you listening?

ID=100007120
... You go early.

ID=100007121
Oh yeah, I got in early.\nI have a story with Major ....

ID=100007122
(... air is tight. Let's get away from this place soon)

ID=510001501
... Full record update ... and so on.

ID=410001501
It's been five years. The record was repainted.

ID=210001701
... Again, it looks like it's not just a different person.\nThanks to all the equipment inside the virtual reality overheated.

ID=210001702
All the forces acting inside the virtual reality are absorbed all the time and are converted as power.\nHowever, the facility is messed up because of its power exceeding its tolerance.

ID=210001703
... It takes time to recover. I can not do anything until then.

ID=210001704
Therefore, we decided to move troops to neighboring town Rokotown.\nCould you show me to Miriam.

ID=610001701
... I have to write a manuscript that blows away the facility.\nFuu ~ ....

ID=100017101
Good job today!\nIt was pretty amazing ~.

ID=510001701
Sorry to deceive you about physical examinations.\nI thought I was frightened and ran away ... Huh.

ID=510001702
But ... it looks like you were at the physical examination level ....

ID=510001703
Anyway, we are heading for a town called Rocotown, which is near from now.\nYou better than this laboratory if you can see the sky, do you?

ID=510001704
Well, even if you say it is empty, it's not a big deal ....

ID=510001705
I am going soon, so go ahead.

ID=510001706
see you later.

ID=510001707
(I left the facility and got on the truck)

ID=510001708


ID=510001709
......

ID=510001710
Miriam

ID=510001711
I was waiting.\nhow is it?

ID=510001712
It is as you guessed.

ID=510001713
Apparently ... seems to be certain?

ID=510001714
Ahh. I can not conclude yet ... but.\nThat power ... the possibility is extremely high.

ID=510001715
... ... please ... as it is.

ID=510001716
... I hope so.

ID=510001717
Introduction: Aoi Night.\nComplete.

ID=210002001
This is Rocotown.

ID=210002002
As you can see, to tell the city ... ... It is impossible.

ID=210002003
But it's relatively safe, so there are quite a lot of people living here.\nBesides, that's right! It is also a city where few self sufficiency can be made.

ID=210002004
Well then, well ... I wonder what I should talk about ....

ID=210002005
There was a big change in the world during the 15 years when you were sleeping.\nClearly, it is the collapse of the world.

ID=210002006
The cause is "blank" ....\nIf you say something blank .... Oh? A little nice? It looks like communication.

ID=210002007
Yes. It is Miriam.

ID=210002008
Yes. ... No, especially now.\n... Huh? A young child? Why are young children in the mining site .... Wrong mistake?

ID=210002009
Yes. Yes, I understand.\nI will search for it.

ID=210002010
I'd like a shampoo at the time of receiving this supplement. That's why it's a chara ....\nIt has been a tough job recently. Heh.

ID=210002011
Yes. Okay.

ID=210002012
......

ID=210002013
Well ... what should I do?\nIt seems I have to go right now.

ID=210002014
It seems that a small child has been witnessed at the mining site.\n... It is probably a mistake in looking ... but I can not stop looking.

ID=210002015
I will head to the mining site ... what should I do?

ID=210002016
That's it! A woman who is wearing a white costume over there ... I say it is sunny,\nFirst of all let me tell her various things.

ID=610002001
Well then, I am a little busy ....\nsorry. See you.

ID=310002001
Hey, come to Sunny soon.\nDo not leave your way.

ID=710002001
No ... Why are you refusing?

ID=100020101
Oh, are you a child rescued a while ago ...?

ID=510002001
Your physical condition seems to be good.\n... So, is there something for me?

ID=410002001
Huh? Miriam?\nMr. ... this is always like this.

ID=210002501
Well, it is not what I began with now.\nI will briefly explain.

ID=210002502
This world has changed completely.\nLook over there.

ID=210002503
Cause that changed this world ... "Blank" yo.\nYes, somewhere is a huge natural disaster that is super large.

ID=210002504
Because of the blank which hit this world,\nAlmost all the civilizations you know have been lost.

ID=210002505
People have joined forces and finally approached the level of civilization 15 years ago.\nBut that means that it's been lost for 15 years ....

ID=210002506
Besides, the blanks are not a simple natural disaster.\nAfter the blank occurred, strange things began to occur in the world.

ID=210002507
Living organisms commonly called "existence of different world"\nI began to appear and disappear in the crowdream.

ID=210002508
I understand that they are human enemies ... only.

ID=210002509
And just as if to counter the existence of such a foreign world,\nPeople with new power appeared.

ID=210002510
Existence with unknown power that transcends human beings far ....

ID=210002511
Humans who returned to this world from the blanks have that power without exception.\nBut I do not know the detailed cause.\nJust being guessed that it is due to blank ... / /.

ID=210002512
They are called 'interrogators'.\nMiriam and Liu who helped you are one of them.

ID=210002513
Currently, we are very few foreign players who will be the main force of the Starry Forest Alliance.\nBut their influence and combat strength are not comparable to the one army.

ID=210002514
So ... ... if there is a sign of emptying something,\nEven with a lot of sacrifice, it moves to secure it.

ID=210002515
That is why you could rescue immediately when you fell out of the blank.

ID=210002516
......

ID=210002517
... There are 11 soldiers sacrificed in the process of rescuing you.\nIt is not to mention that there was a person waiting for each one to go home.

ID=210002518
......

ID=210002519
... I'm sorry.\nIt's not your fault ... it's overstated.

ID=210002520
... That's right. Visit Major Benjamin.\nI'll be waiting for you.

ID=610002501
I'm sorry. There is still an arrangement of my mind ....\nI am sorry, but for now, will you leave me gently?

ID=310002501
Major Benjamin is in the center of Locotown.\nIf it says that it is my introduction, that's fine.

ID=710002501
Oh, have you missed any explanation?

ID=100025101
It was late.\nWere you caught by Miriam and Sunny?

ID=510002501
If you empathize to a different person, it will be a bad thing ....\nBesides Miriam, even Sunny even ... It can not be helped.

ID=410002501
Then, from now on you will say what you should do.

ID=210003001
You are a different person but you do not know right or left yet.\nAn important mission will be to determine ability.

ID=210003002
Therefore, have you start with miscellaneous affairs.\nFirst, replace the bandage of the injured person and clean the bed cover.

ID=210003003
Do not complain even if you have dissatisfaction.\nIf a child like you seems to have the power and if it violently arbitrarily ....

ID=210003004
Bebe Major Benjamin!\nIt is serious!

ID=210003005
... What happened?

ID=210003006
Emergency contact from bowling work site!\nSoul junk has emerged ...!

ID=210003007
... what?\nShould the soul junk in the vicinity have been wiped out?

ID=210003008
Hmm? Wait ....\nHow was the contact from the search members?

ID=210003009
... Currently, the situation is lost contact.\nI had a communication saying that I found a child from Miriam ....

ID=210003010
... It became a troublesome thing.

ID=210003011
Let's rescue!\nBefore it's too late!

ID=210003012
What you want to do is mountains, but the residual force of Locotown is close to zero ....\nI sacrificed much in last rescue operations.

ID=210003013
......

ID=210003014
(Sunny sees as if it appeals)

ID=210003015
You ... can not you ask?

ID=210003016
Sunny! What are you ...!?

ID=210003017
I heard you can not go!\nPlease answer!

ID=210003018
It is useless!\nI have not woken up yet! too fast!

ID=210003019
But it is a different person! Interlude who rescued with much sacrifice ...!\nIf you do not depend on such a time ... for everyone ... for everyone ...!

ID=210003020
That's why you can not send it out to death terribly!\nDo you intend to repeat the same mistake again?

ID=210003021
... I do not have authority to order Major.\nThis girl is not yet affiliated with the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=210003022
In other words, it will leave everything to this child's will.

ID=210003023
......

ID=210003024
I am a human being ....\nI want to ask you who has the ability to transcend human power.

ID=210003025
Miriam ... can you please help her?

ID=610003001
... Thank you.\nReally ... really ....

ID=610003002
Sunny ...!\nyou ...!

ID=610003003
... I will fight for a moment.\nQuickly.

ID=610003004
... Good grief, do it your way.\nCertainly, we have no authority to control your behavior.

ID=610003005
In other words, all decisions can be decided by your will.\nOf course, it is your responsibility.

ID=610003006
......

ID=610003007
There is only one request.

ID=610003008
... Always, live and return.

ID=310003001
Be sure to live and come home.

ID=100045101
......

ID=100045102
After all it is just as I thought.

ID=100045103
But, the soul workers should not be able to awaken without the soul spirit ....\n... Ah! The child of a little while ago ...!

ID=100045104
Maybe the southern child is Seoul Spirit ...?\nIf that is the case, the streaks will fit. ... I thought that her complexion was bad.

ID=100045105
Let's go back to Rocotown once.\nA detailed story is there.

ID=100045106
Soul worker ...?

ID=510004501
Fuh, I thought it was no good.\nThank you for your help,%username%.

ID=510004502
... Huh, a bit confused, do not you?\nI will explain step by step.

ID=410004501
Among the different people,\nA person with overwhelming power is called a "soul worker".

ID=210005001
It can be said that it is just a strong intercourse ... but,\nThe wavelength of energy emitted is different from others.

ID=210005002
Most importantly, using a weapon is a decisive difference from other competitors.\nThe incompatibility and incompatibility of weapons are the worst. Therefore, you can only depend on your skill by the other people.

ID=210005003
The power of the soul worker is enough to overturn the war situation in a flash.\nCurrently, there are only two soul workers belonging to the Stary Forest Alliance.\nBut its influence is tremendous.

ID=210005004
... I think I already know, but it is a precious existence.\nSo, the Star Forest Federation has been looking around for soul workers all the time.

ID=210005005
Up until now, we had no choice but to defend against the existence of a different world ....\nThere was too much difference in fighting strength, so we could not compete with the different persons and the army alone.

ID=210005006
Thanks to the two soul workers who barely endured it.\nBut ... you can come up with an attack thanks to you for coming.

ID=210005007
The fight grows fiercely day by day and is sacrificing a lot.\nPeople's lives are also rough, human beings are perishing.

ID=210005008
You must have appeared there.\nJust like a savior.

ID=210005009
... Do you have a favor?\nLend me your power.

ID=210005010
... I know that it is painful. But I want you to become power.\nAs one soul worker.

ID=610005001
Thank you.\n... No way this day really comes.

ID=610005002
I'm bad at once, but I would like people to help those left behind in the bowling scene.\nThose who went with me, survival has been confirmed.

ID=610005003
There are three life reactions in all. I do not have much time.\nIt's not strange when Seoul Junk attacks you.

ID=610005004
Oh, and that.\nBe careful when using the power as a soul worker.

ID=610005005
This world ... what I say, though.\nI'm crazy beyond my imagination.

ID=610005006
Everyone ... I'm desperately trying to get the power to survive in this world.\nWhatever its power is ....

ID=610005007
Ned Company ... Blank religious faith ....\nEveryone is a group seeking strength.

ID=610005008
In order not to be used by them,\nYou'd better be careful not to let you know that you are a soul worker.

ID=610005009
We may also be one of the Starry Forest Union ... ....\nBut we are the organization for this world.

ID=610005010
I believe ... so.\nI'd be happy if you think so.

ID=610005011
Someday your time will come when you choose.\nBut now I want you to trust us.

ID=610005012
... You can not. I also made the atmosphere heavier.\nDo not worry, come and go.

ID=310005001
Helping isolated people in the bowling scene.\nThere are three life reactions in all. Do not forget.

ID=710005001
Ah ~, soul worker awakening memorial ... Did it get rejected?

ID=100050101
What! What? Well, oh!\nIt's taking me! Soul junk widow!

ID=100050102
Contact Wh ... who are you?\nIs not that a rescue?

ID=100050103
Fu ... I was saved.\nIt was about getting killed.

ID=100050104
Have you hedged a topic recently in Loco Town?\nHaha ... I can hardly move so much anymore.

ID=100050105
I am Eric.\nIt is a worker working at Ned Company.

ID=100050106
I was taking a nap while working, but when I woke up this zama.\nThere are soo junk all around.

ID=100050107
It seems that you came when you were at a loss.\nI was about to get rid of bachelorly. Ha ha!

ID=100050108
There should be some people still left behind.\n... I am sure. I heard a scream.

ID=100050109
Anyway, I will never forget this kindness.\nI'm a forgiven man "Eric". Remember properly.

ID=510005001
Cure, you are the rescue team! What? It was saved.

ID=410005001
... Huh? A child...?

ID=210005501
... Is that so. You are a blue night strategy ....\nAre you here alone? After all it is not a different ability person.

ID=210005502
I am okay.\nI just got tired a bit.

ID=210005503
Rather than that, please do something about that one.\nI will not talk a word from a little while ago.

ID=610005504
I was terrified by something.\nI will not open my mouth so I do not understand anything.

ID=310005501
It seems to say that children are going to adult adults ....\nThank you.

ID=710005501
Well, it is useless! What? Is it useless! What?

ID=100055101
Rescue team ...?\nWell, it seems to be still young, but ... I do not care.

ID=100055102
A wolf ... a wolf has gone.\nIt is different from ordinary soul junk ....

ID=100055103
I remember the appearance changed every time I saw it.\nIt turns white if I think it is black ... / /.\nWow ... maybe I have touched it.

ID=100055104
I saw him in the future.\nPerhaps ... that may be a waking body.

ID=100055105
Wow, we will already go.\nI do not understand when he will show up.

ID=510005501
As expected. My eyes did not go wrong.

ID=410005501
... I was in trouble.\nIt became a little troublesome.

ID=210006001
Remember? That day when you fell from the blank ... ...\nThat wolf suddenly appeared and attacked.

ID=210006002
Code name "Wolf of greed".\nThat belongs to a category called "awakening body".

ID=210006003
Oh, soul junk is called.\nIt is a collection of various organic matter and inorganic matter born in the blank.

ID=210006004
I do not know what is the purpose ....\nBut one thing I can say is that we are enemies.

ID=210006005
High ranking presence in Seoul Junk ....\nThat's a "wake up body."

ID=210006006
The wake-up body "greedy wolf" was witnessed at the mining site\nI have a lot of incoming calls. It is not once or twice.

ID=210006007
Did you hear also?\nIf so, then you definitely are already ....

ID=210006008
I feel that power to swallow Soul spirit\nI wonder if she is wandering around the mining site.

ID=210006009
Lieutenant Liu is working on a search ahead.\nImmediately joining Lieutenant Liu towards the mining site.

ID=610006001
Long ago ... to a single awakening body\nOne town was destroyed.

ID=610006002
That is a dangerous opponent.\nWe need to deal with it as soon as possible.

ID=310006001
Join Lieutenant Liu.\nYou should know who you are.

ID=710006001
Hey, are not you playing around?\nDo you know the situation?

ID=510006001
Did you come ...?

ID=410006001
have been waiting.

ID=210006501
The rumor seems to be true.\nI confirmed the existence of a waking body.

ID=210006502
It is no doubt the wolf that hit you at that time.\nFortunately, the wound at that time seems to have not cured yet.

ID=210006503
There is no hand to miss this aircraft.\nPiercing the Todome.

ID=610006501
... Bad, but I can not do it.\nI felt keenly at that time that it was not my opponent.

ID=610006502
Activities are heard from Sunny and Miriam.\nYou ought to be able to do it. [M]

ID=310006501
Defeat the wake-up body "Wolf of greed".

ID=710006501
I heard that they like jokes.\nHowever, it seems that we can not make a situation judgment.

ID=510006501
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry for tiredness.\nI have bad news.

ID=410006501
... Well, I do not have time to rest.

ID=210007001
I confirmed the annihilation of "wolf of greed".\nBut it seems that a bigger thing appeared.

ID=210007002
Code name "Clown of the blue flame".\nIn the past, Vesi with a rank of S with the risk of acquiring a lot of different persons.

ID=210007003
By the Allied Forces of Benelis Department Captain and Ein Deputy Commander\nI was deemed to have died ... It was not alright to live.

ID=210007004
Besides, it seems that you are a favorite of a blue flame clown.\nHere, a letter has arrived at you ....

ID=610007001
It is a design that you can understand immediately even from a clown of a blue flame?\nPerhaps it is a love letter?\n... A joke. Heh.

ID=610007002
Pass the contents of the letter to Major Benjamin.\nYou should be told something.

ID=610007003
Then ... Thank you for your hard work.\nSoul workers are amazing.

ID=610007004
Even though I was awakening, I did not knock down the awake body.\nI do not know which is the monster .... Heh.

ID=310007001
Go to Major Benjamin.\nIt seemed like something to say.

ID=710007001
Even I, I wish for such a suspicious letter ....\nBut why not try it? It might be funny ~?

ID=100070101
Did you come ...?

ID=100070102
After acting without permission,\nA different person who came back with a further crisis ... No, it is a soul worker.

ID=100070103
... but it did a good job.\nDefeating the awakening body and saving people ... On behalf of everyone, thank you.

ID=100070104
We know that those who awoke to new abilities like you,\nI've been drowning in that power ... I have been seeing deadly deaths several times.

ID=100070105
No more ... I did not want to see such a thing.\nI appreciate it if you understand.

ID=100070106
With this now, I will appoint you as a member of the Star Forest Alliance.\nI will ask for your best regards in the future. Soul worker,%username%.

ID=100070107
Let's go back to the story.\nDid you confirm the contents of the letter?

ID=100070108
Hmm? Have you sent a present?

ID=100070109
... Gifts from Hitsu that is known for being cranky and brutal ....\nI do not feel glad it got it.

ID=100070110
The place where blue fever clown gifts sent presents is the jurisdiction of Sunny.\nTake information sharing from Sunny and start searching.

ID=100070201
The strategy area name "R Square" was the shopping street that represented the western part of Crow Dream.\nI was playing the role of connecting Rochotown and Crow Dream.

ID=100070202
For the Star Forest Alliance it is only a passage to other areas,\nIn other words, it will be an invasion route to Loco Town.

ID=100070203
Because it is a wide shopping street open on all sides,\nIt is hard to think that there is a problem in securing the field of view.

ID=100070204
The partner is Vesi ....\nYou should get advice from Lieutenant Liu.\nBecause he has fought with Vesi.

ID=100070205
... And thank you.\nListen to my unreasonable request.

ID=100070206
But ... I still can not let you heart.\nWhether it is a soul worker or not, it is certain that there are people who have been sacrificed for you.

ID=510007001
I heard stories from Sunny.

ID=410007001
Let me explain what you know about Vesi.

ID=210007501
Vesi is the creature of another world that appeared with Soul junk after the blank.\nI can understand words with a look similar to humans. It is just a human being if you look at it normally.

ID=210007502
However, it is only appearance.\nBasic physical ability and thinking circuit are completely different from that of human being.

ID=210007503
It looks exactly like a human, but the root is different.\nThe war with them continues even now.

ID=210007504
I do not know what triggered the war.\nI've been fighting for so long to forget it.

ID=210007505
Whether it is OK, never give up.\nVesi is not a human being.\nIt is impossible to approach humans.

ID=210007506
I will leave the search of R square.\nWe will get ready for assuming the worst.

ID=610007501
Locotown, which was quiet, seems to be noisy.

ID=310007501
Ask the search for R square.

ID=710007501
... I do not have time to play.\nGo ahead.

ID=510007501
......

ID=410007501
The operator is listening to the situation.\n... It is a wonderful gift. What is the doll's army ....

ID=210008001
However, the instruction system has not been determined,\nIndividuals' battle abilities are not high. This can be said to be lucky.

ID=210008002
However, I can not get rid of it. A reaction of a huge doll was confirmed.\nI am slowly invading towards Loco Town.

ID=210008003
Code name "Big Puppet".\nIt seems like the size, but the problem lies elsewhere.

ID=210008004
As a result of scanning in military satellite Indra,\nIt was confirmed that a big detonator was built in the big puppet.

ID=210008005
Explosion prediction radius is about 10 km.\nIf it explodes near Locotown ... it is over.

ID=210008006
This is not a level that can be solved only by the Star Forest Association of Locotown.\nHowever it is a situation that I can not hope for support from Grace City.

ID=210008007
Pouring all the troops we can mobilize and earn time ....\nTo be honest, I have no idea how far I can bear.

ID=210008008
An intercept in a helicopter is the most ideal ....\nThe problem is that even helicopters or even tanks are scarce.

ID=210008009
Fortunately, a helicopter owned by Ned Company remains in R Square.\nThere is no hand that does not use this.

ID=210008010
We are requesting support from Nokda's Loco Town branch representative, Sean.\nThat's all there is to it.

ID=610008001
Beforehand to say, I can not expect a good reply.\nBut do not choose the means and methods.

ID=310008001
It is Ned Company representative "Sean" who is stationed in Locotown.\nGo to him and officially request cooperation.

ID=710008001
Because refusing does not mean that the situation will improve.\nTime is passing by moment.

ID=100080101
Is the newly added ability of the Star Forest Alliance an Anta?\nI heard rumors.

ID=100080102
However, the rumor is that the tail finishes.\nYou seem to be pretending to be a starry forest coalition too.

ID=510008001
Does something unfamiliar to you, do you plan to do with your hero?\nYou can not laugh at all, it's a joke.

ID=410008001
Well, what is the best talented person leading Ned Company, Sean?

ID=210008501
Hmm? Cooperation? Helicopter\nWhat did the doll's troops made by Vesi attack?

ID=210008502
Oh, he can not be there. Rocotown becomes ruined,\nI can do it like this in the countryside. my mother!

ID=210008503
Here is nothing from me. I'm a town.\nI do not think that Vesi will give me the chance to get out of here!

ID=210008504
Do not miss seeing such a chance, do not you?\nThat's why. I will refuse the cooperation request of the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=210008505
First of all, why do I have to cooperate with you?\nGo back to the end of the fun and cooperate with me? Do not be silly.

ID=610008501
It makes me laugh at all.\nI do not even know courtesy.

ID=610008502
......

ID=310008501
Come home quickly.\nThere is nothing to say any more.

ID=710008501
It is hoping or fulfilling.\nGo ahead. I am also busy.

ID=100085101
Oh, apparently this mistaken man "Eric"\nIt seems time has come for us to reward the benefits of you!

ID=100085102
Well ... I've heard a story as I passed through.\nAre you having a hard time getting cooperation from Sean?

ID=100085103
Well it is not impossible either.\nIt seems that he can not believe that he has been released to such a country yet.

ID=100085104
But ... Of course,\nThere is a mon caused by things.

ID=100085105
I wonder why Shaun was released to such a countryside?\nIt's strange, huh? I wonder why?

ID=100085106
Hehehe ... well! I'll write a good thing.\nTry showing this to Sean.

ID=100085107
If you look at this surely, you should want to cooperate with the Star Forest Alliance?\nI will declare!

ID=510008501
You again?\nThere is nothing to say any more.

ID=410008501
what? Request sentence ... Erik?\nChit ... It's a crap that you wrote it with emotions.

ID=210009001
It is troublesome. ... April 27th.\nRoad construction funds ... 400 million ... embezzle ....

ID=210009002
Wipe ...! ! Damn it! !\n(Sean seemed to feel badly broke Erik's request sentence and threw it away)

ID=210009003
Huh ... Hey ....

ID=210009004
Oh, that guy ...!\nAll related materials should have been disposed of ...! ! Damn it!

ID=210009005
... Hmm! Good! I will cooperate!\nAbout that ... I gotta do it! Damn it!\nI will issue an unmanned helicopter. But ...

ID=210009006
The helicopter AI module is out of order.\nIn other words, even attacks do not even operate.

ID=210009007
However, I do not think that you have the ability to make AI modules ....\nHuh, after all it looks like I'm gonna make it. Whew.

ID=210009008
It takes some time to produce the AI ​​module.\nMeanwhile, you can handle dolls around the helicopter with R square.

ID=610009001
If I clear up the place cleanly, I will bring the AI ​​module directly.\nI will do so far. Think god a little?

ID=310009001
Go to the R square and clean up the dolls.\nIn the meantime I will make an AI module and carry it.

ID=710009001
Huh?\nDid you forget where you are now?

ID=510009001
Huh ... Hey ....\nI have not seen you for a while. It is not different from the old days ... Ha ha ....

ID=410009001
Fuu ... I brought the AI ​​module.\nWhy do not you thank you for your kindness?

ID=210009501
I made the AI ​​module settings an attack on that foolish big guy.\nI had a little time but I could also use mind to avoid it ....

ID=210009502
Do not you know such time, you know better?\nTherefore, thankfully saying the fourth five, thankfully received.

ID=210009503
Oh, this is the AI ​​module.\nI installed it automatically by connecting to a helicopter computer.

ID=210009504
Okay, I'm already finished so let me go home.\nWhy, I wonder why .... (Lumpwood)

ID=210009505
See you!\nAt best do your best!

ID=610009501
Do not go home early ....

ID=710009501
Are you kidding, are you kidding?

ID=510009501
... Well, I have no words.\nThis is too cheap ....

ID=410009501
This is the last resort.

ID=210010001
As Plan A failed,\nSwitch to Plan B "The Shield".

ID=210010002
Not to mention the Star Forest Alliance,\nIt is a large-scale strategy launched until the troops of Ned Company.\nListen carefully.

ID=210010003
A lot of transport aircraft are currently flying above the R square.\nThere are huge protective walls on the transport aircraft.

ID=210010004
The guard wall is the castle lock series covering the outer wall of Grace City.\nNeedless to say performance.

ID=210010005
If the current invasion Big Puppet invades a specific area,\nDrop a protective wall from the air.

ID=210010006
In other words, you can trap the Big Puppet within the guard wall.

ID=210010007
After capturing is completed, battle to induce suicide bombardment of the big puppet.\nNo matter how intense the explosion, you can not break the barrier.

ID=210010008
... The central figure of this strategy is not the other,\n%username%. You.

ID=210010009
You have the Big Puppet guided to a specific spot.\nAfter that, you fight until the barrier completely encloses the Big Puppet.

ID=210010010
Before all the protective walls surround the big puppet,\nYou need to leave that place.

ID=210010011
... It's a very dangerous strategy.\nIf timing is delayed even a little, the underlay of the protective wall ... or get caught in the explosion.

ID=210010012
But ... this is the only way.\nAnd who can do this ... you are only you.

ID=210010013
I understand that it is a selfish request. But ... I beg you.\nRocotown's fate depends on you.

ID=210010014
Also, there is one problem before the strategy.\nIt means that the visibility of the R square is very bad now.

ID=210010015
First, in order to transfer all coordinate values ​​of the R square to the pilot of the transport machine,\nIt is necessary to operate the urgent scanning device.

ID=610010001
... you have to.\nCome back alive.

ID=310010001
First, head towards R square and activate the scanning device.

ID=710010001
... Does it so explain so far? It's a shame.

ID=510010001
Hey,%username%!

ID=410010001
Hehe, were you surprised?\nI also had a hard time coming here.

ID=210010501
I have something to give to you a bit.\nBy the way, this strategy ... is it dangerous?

ID=210010502
Please accept this first. High performance GPS.\nIf the pilot knows the position of you, you do not accidentally crush you.

ID=210010503
My salary is three months' worth? I am in trouble if it helps!\nIf it is not enough money is not it, is it? Ha ha!

ID=210010504
......

ID=210010505
... I was blank and I lost everything.\nNeither family nor friends ... everyone got out of acquaintance.

ID=210010506
Wander around here and let it reach Rocotown ....\nSo, I got a friend to socialize like a brother.

ID=210010507
It was a synchronized soldier of the Star Forest Alliance ....

ID=210010508
A while ago I lost my life with a strategy to help you.

ID=210010509
Oh, that's why I hate you.\nJust ... just let me know.

ID=210010510
For you you know that there were people who lived there.

ID=210010511
You can fail. I hope she ran away.\nJust ... do not die. Do not give me your life.

ID=210010512
Even just that ... everyone is sure to be satisfied.

ID=210010513
... Was the load suddenly increased? It can not be helped.\nYou ought to carry it on and you have to go live.

ID=210010514
Come, go fast and settle down with that pig like that one.\nI will not run away from here.

ID=610010501
I'm watching over you.\nI will try my best at the beginning.

ID=610010502
Go and come!\nHero of Locotown!

ID=310010501
Show me the big guy who said that big puppet!

ID=710010501
Hey ... I am serious! Take it!

ID=510010501
......

ID=410010501
Thank you for putting my life for Loco Town ....\nDid you even say that?

ID=210011001
What are you thinking?\nWith a soul worker, did you think that explosion could be stopped?

ID=210011002
Run away with all your power if you are going to fail the strategy!\nWhat would you do if you died ...? The thought of the leftover person, I have thought about it! What?

ID=210011003
Did you want to be a hero?\nSo ... Who will rejoice?

ID=210011004
Completely ... I only asked for that!

ID=210011005
If you do the same thing again ....\nThere is no next time!

ID=210011006
......

ID=210011007
...... I'm glad that it was safe.

ID=210011008
It is a place that I want to squeeze it heavily for about three hours in a pleasant way ....\n... I will give you around this.

ID=210011009
Try going to Eric's place.\nI was carried away from the R square with distraction.

ID=610011001
I told you to talk with you, so please go early.

ID=310011001
Mr. Eric is waiting.\nPlease go early.

ID=710011001
Yup? Was the sermon three hour course better?

ID=100110101
... Oh, I came.

ID=100110102
Well done.\nI believed that you can do it.

ID=100110103
But, you are yours ....\nWell, well, I understand that the Ned Company was bad.

ID=100110104
Though it was good that I was saved luckily.\nIf not so ....

ID=100110105
I was about to waste the feelings of the people who died for you.

ID=100110106
Hun, you do not deserve it so well, are not you?\nHey who is thinking only about myself is crazy.

ID=100110107
Group leader, please be quiet.

ID=100110108
What?\nAt a dual employee's dilemma ...!

ID=100110109
Oh? Should it be better to write a request sentence again?

ID=100110110
......

ID=100110111
Anyway, promise that we will not be such an inconceience anymore.\nI guess it was for everyone.

ID=100110112
On the contrary, why do you end up struggling everyone?

ID=100110113
Well, well, it feels like you guys!\nEven if I got that explosion, it is intact!

ID=100110114
I was just looking in the distance, bibiri\nI was losing myself. Ha ha ha!

ID=100110115
Chibi was fun, it was boring.

ID=100110116
Would you like the group head to be so if it is okay?

ID=100110117
this ...!\nBecause I found one weak point, I got on feeling ...!

ID=100110118
Okay, not necessarily one?\nWould you like to discuss the weaknesses of your group once and for all?

ID=100110119
Let's do it!\nOh, well, I'm going to be silent ...!

ID=100110120
Oops, scary scary!\nIt seems like chills!

ID=100110121
You bastard! People are going to be quiet and tied up ...!\n(The quarrel between Shaun and Eric was gradually getting wierd)

ID=100110122
......

ID=100110123
It is noisy.\n%username%. Is there a little time?

ID=510011001
I have heard some stories.

ID=410011001
... well done.

ID=210011501
I do not know what kind of thought you have forced such a thing.\nSacrifice spirit, hero psychology ... I do not understand.

ID=210011502
It is not important what kind of thought put the life.\nThe important thing is that we lived a life.

ID=210011503
You put your life on your own idea and acted.\nSuch a resolute determination ... It is not easy to do.

ID=210011504
It is the power to live in this world ... "Resolution".\nPerhaps you already have it.

ID=210011505
Never give up now.\nDo not give up, prove your own determination.

ID=210011506
Keep it in your mind.\nResignation kills people.

ID=210011507
... Was it a praise or a reprimand? I got ambiguous words.\nI am sorry to have taken the time.

ID=210011508
Major Benjamin will be waiting.\nI will not say a good thing. Get ready.

ID=610011501
Do not keep the Majority soon.

ID=310011501
Go to Major Benjamin.

ID=710011501
... It is a non-smart joke. Or is it serious?

ID=100115101
Did you come ...?

ID=510011501
Wow ....\nHonestly, I do not know what kind of attitude I should treat you.

ID=510011502
Whether it should be condemned or encouraged ... I was worried very much.\nBut in the end there is only one conclusion.

ID=510011503
If you think that you are right, move on to execution.\nWe just watch over.

ID=510011504
... What kind of road will you follow ...?

ID=410011501
However,\nPlease refrain from imitating useless life like this time.

ID=210012001
While you are in charge of duty, we have also continued the investigation.\nOf course, the subject of investigation is codename "clown of blue flame".

ID=210012002
Regardless of the findings, I succeeded in finding out where the clown of the blue flame was.\nThe place closed hospital ... There is a guy there.

ID=210012003
Because there was no confirmation, I dispatched a small reconnaissance team ....\nIt is a situation where all the signals are stopped.

ID=210012004
Strong jamming waves were emitted as soon as I told you that I was waiting.\nNot even communication, even life conditions can not be confirmed.

ID=210012005
I do not want to say much, but ....\nThere is also the possibility of too late. However, I will not give up.

ID=210012006
I want you to go to a closed hospital and check the survival of the lead team.

ID=610012001
It is a simple reconnaissance mission. Do not push yourself.\n... Well good. I do not seem to be afraid to be afraid.

ID=310012001
I would like you to investigate the survival of the search forces in the closed ward.

ID=710012001
Does it mean that it is unsatisfactory by the reconnaissance mission?

ID=100120101
Aww...

ID=510012001
Are you a support soldier ...?\nIt was good.

ID=410012001
George ... George.

ID=210012501
I ... I am no good.\nI do not feel any more pain any more. Jehovgeh!

ID=210012502
I do not care anymore.\nThen the field of vision has become dark ... ....

ID=210012503
But, there are still those who survive ....\nPlease help them ... Please help.

ID=610012501
Watashi ... I'm waiting ... should be.\nSomeone's ... ... help ....

ID=310012501
Other ... everyone ... please ...!

ID=710012501
The last ... ... asking ... ....

ID=100125101
Are you a rescue team ...?\nOh ... Thank you.

ID=100125102
A doll ... ... attacks ....\nThey are ... the only thing that hurts us seems to be ....

ID=100125103
Um ... I can not stop laughing from my ears.\n... Like a cry of human life ... ... Ku!

ID=100125104
And anyway ... I will withdraw.\nQuickly ... to a safe place ....

ID=100125105
There should have been another one yet ....\nWould you please help me?

ID=100125201
To the doll ...!\nEarly ... I have to get out of here early ...!

ID=100125202
I already ... a doll ... I do not want to see it again!

ID=100125203
Thank you for helping me.\nBut it is not likely to be useful any more.

ID=100125204
I do not want to fight anymore.\nI do not want to die ...!

ID=510012501
You ....\nIt was too late ....

ID=410012501
But there were survivors ....\nThat alone is enough.

ID=210013001
A letter came from a clown during the searching mission.\nIt seems that the way to meet him is written.

ID=210013002
According to the report of the search team, the specific part of the hospital,\nIt seems that you can not enter because of a powerful special field.

ID=210013003
We have no way to break through that special field.\nThis letter arrived beside me trying to find a way to deal with it.

ID=210013004
The content of the letter is simple.\nHow to go through special fields ....

ID=210013005
That is to wear the badge his men have.

ID=210013006
In other words, to meet the blue clown clown\nI mean you need to get the badges that his men have.

ID=610013001
... I understand it.\nI wonder what is the purpose.

ID=610013002
... But apparently I like you.

ID=610013003
I do not know what happened ....\nIt seems that you can not finish this case.

ID=310013001
Kill the subordinate of the blue fiery clown,\nGet your proof.

ID=710013001
It is irresponsible.\nTo escape at such times.

ID=510013001
This is the badge the clown of the blue flame said?\n... It is a bad hobby.

ID=410013001
Anyway, we are ready for this.

ID=210013501
I do not know the purpose, but ....\nIt certainly is a threat to human beings.

ID=210013502
Somehow, it looks like you were curious.\nYou should respond to that expectation to the utmost.

ID=210013503
Although I am alone.\nShow off the power of the soul worker.

ID=610013501
But the other party is that infamous blue fiery clown.\nDo not let your guard down.

ID=310013501
A perfect opportunity to beat the blue fiery clown!

ID=710013501
Even if you can win at any time?\nThat's not easy, right?

ID=510013501
... I guess it's not going to run away. I have no idea what I'm thinking.\nIt seems that it was not even chased.

ID=410013501
Anyway, it was a pain.\nIt seems that we have overcome the crisis for the moment.

ID=210014001
Hold the case closed with the present moment.

ID=210014002
There is also an order from the Star Forest Coalition Command ... ....\nI am worried about the trend of the guy, but it seems only to pray for nothing.

ID=210014003
You are now following the order from the headquarters ....

ID=210014004
Bebe Major Benjamin!\nIt is serious!

ID=210014005
...? What happened Miriam.\nIt is not like it. You are distracted so much.

ID=210014006
B, to Loco Town ....\nA lot of bombs were confirmed in Locotown!

ID=210014007
... What did you say?

ID=210014008
It is information from Eric and Sean.\nI found a large number of bombs while working at the mining site ....

ID=210014009
Result of investigation ....\nThrough the sewer pipe of Locotown, the bomb was confirmed to be installed throughout the area.

ID=210014010
... What's the scale?

ID=210014011
... It is not a certain number, but it is estimated to be twice as big as a big puppet.

ID=210014012
... It is amazing.\nIs disassembling work possible?

ID=210014013
It is possible ... but it will take some time.\nThe fear of exploding in the meantime.

ID=210014014
......

ID=210014015
Then ... a message from a clown of a blue flame.

ID=210014016
%username%. Invite you ... ....

ID=210014017
Hm ... that is.\nIf you do not respond to the invitation, it will blow up Loco Town ... that.

ID=210014018
It seems like that. Do you call happiness of unhappiness ...?\nThe whereabouts of blue fiery clown has been identified.

ID=210014019
It is the roof of a closed hospital.\nBut ... there are also numerous bombs.

ID=210014020
... It is clearly a trap.\nBut there is no room for selection.

ID=210014021
... it can not be helped.\n%username%. Do according to his invitation.

ID=210014022
I will rush as much as possible regarding bomb removal work.\nLet's keep the helicopter around the hospital's rooftop.

ID=210014023
Make time by battle with blue fiery clown,\nIf he shows an explosion that will detonate the rooftop, escape with a helicopter.

ID=210014024
While you are making time,\nAnything will release all bombs.

ID=210014025
And if possible ...\nThis time, surely stop your breath.

ID=610014001
I'm begging you.\nShow me your power to a foolish clown, who treats the lives of people lightly.

ID=610014002
I'll be waiting.\nLeave the bomb.

ID=610014003
... It may be unnecessary care,\nI will abandon my life unnecessarily.

ID=310014001
Clown of a blue flame ....\nI will finish it this time.

ID=710014001
Umm ... It's hard to explain this far.

ID=710014002
I agree.

ID=100140101
......

ID=100140102
The dolls ... something to me ....\nWhy did you embed strange things in the whole body ...?

ID=100140103
Take care ... please!\nBody is ...! Or, the body ... ... ぁ ぁ ぁ ah!

ID=510014001
... It was a hard time.

ID=410014001
It seems that it really ended.

ID=210014501
I also canceled all the bombs that had been installed in Loco Town.\nIt was not a bomb ... but a firecracker.

ID=210014502
Will not the words come? Me too.\nI can not say amazement though.

ID=210014503
Well, what was his aim?\nWas it just play? If so, so far ...

ID=210014504
... No, common sense does not apply to Vesi.

ID=210014505
Anyway, this is all over.\nIt seems to be able to respond to the command of the headquarters.

ID=210014506
You are headed for Kandus city now.\nLend me the power of the Stary Forest Alliance that is stationed.

ID=210014507
Currently, Kandathity is in a state of full war with Vesi.\nIf you go, it will surely be a big force.

ID=210014508
... I am not used to saying goodbye.\nIt was a hard time. %username%.

ID=210014509
It was a work that exceeded our expectations.\nI hope that even in Kandusity, he will be active.

ID=210014510
... Hmm, it is difficult to say goodbye.\nUntil now it was the main thing to hear the testament.

ID=210014511
Let's meet again if there is opportunity. Soul workers.

ID=610014501
Before leaving for Kandathity, keep greetings to others.\nEveryone is waiting for you.

ID=310014501
Talk to everyone.\nIt is degree of parting greetings.

ID=710014501
Do you want to take a day off?\nYou should like it.

ID=100145101
I heard the story.\nYou are going to go to Kandus city, are not you?

ID=100145102
So, one of the reasons for destroying this world so far ....\nIn other words, I will meet Seoul Junk again. Do not mind.

ID=100145103
Nothing is as scary as an enemy whose purpose is unknown.\nDo not forget this.

ID=100145104
Although it was a series of incidents since I woke up,\nYou never give up ... That figure ... I will remember.

ID=100145105
Do not forget the determined determination at all times.\nLet's meet again. %username%.

ID=510014501
... I came.\nI was waiting.

ID=410014501
You are going to Kandusity.\nI wonder how much trouble it will make me feel ....

ID=210015001
... I must apologize to you.\nWhat I told you I can not forgive you ... But that still does not change.

ID=210015002
It will not change that there is a person who lost his life for you.

ID=210015003
But ... you did not waste their death.\nI am thankful for Ryu 's determined resolve ...?

ID=210015004
... I think I'm sorry.\nMe too ... I was scared all the time.

ID=210015005
Children who took strength, drowned in that power, dropped their lives ....\nI will certainly remember.

ID=210015006
But I knew it when I stopped Big Puppet.\nThis girl ... I understand.

ID=210015007
I know well what I am carrying.

ID=210015008
That's enough. And do not forget.\nWhen and at any time ... that there are people who lost their lives for you ....

ID=210015009
... Did you talk to Kohon, Miriam already?\nI told you I want to say goodbye.

ID=610015001
... Good job.\nI hope to see you again.

ID=310015001
Go to Miriam's place.

ID=710015001
Huh? Why will not we go?

ID=100150101
Congratulations on to Candas City!\n... I would like to say something like that ....

ID=100150102
That place is more difficult than here.\nDo not be distracted.

ID=100150103
By the way, you seem to be totally attentive?\nI do not want to have a love call anymore.

ID=100150104
Well, is that too natural?\nAwakening body, huge suicide weapon, strange clown, everything was settled.

ID=100150105
But do not be arrogant?\nIf it is not for you, you will be scared of your feet soon.

ID=100150106
Your righteousness is also important, but do not be ruled by it.\nThe real enemy is ... myself.

ID=100150107
So ... Tenebris is ....

ID=100150108
... Ah! Sorry Sorry. Remember a while ago. Hehe.

ID=100150109
There is a person called Aaron in Candas City.\nPlease say hello to me.

ID=100150110
Thanks to you I've come so far ....\nI really appreciate it ....

ID=100150111
It's a bit embarrassing though ... Nice to meet you!

ID=100150112
The way to Kandusity is a bit dangerous.\nWell, if you do not have a problem. Yes, surely okay!

ID=100150113
With no guide, I do not think I know what to do.\nThat's why I live there ... well, I do not know if I can tell people. For now, people.

ID=100150114
I tell him.\nThe name is "Booker TV". That's a weird name.

ID=100150115
Say it 's my introduction properly?\nThen you should be kind.\n'Booker TV'. Did you remember correctly?

ID=100150116
Well, soul worker,%username%.\nThank you for everything for Loco Town.

ID=100150117
If you miss this place, please come home at any time.\nYou are always welcome if you do.

ID=100150118
Take care of yourself.

ID=100150119
(Greeting parting with Miriam and leaving that place)

ID=100150120
......

ID=100150121
You seem to have gone.

ID=100150122
... Looks like it. A disinterested person who fell down from the sky and saved this loco town.

ID=100150123
It was as if it was decided to do so from the beginning ....

ID=100150124
Miriam, Sunny. How about seeing from two people?\nThat child ... Does it look normal?

ID=100150125
......

ID=100150126
......

ID=100150127
I thought ... Is that child the same?

ID=100150128
To be honest, I was also a little surprised. If you are a normal person you can not panic and do nothing.\nThe world I knew completely disappeared and I was thrown out by one person in a place I did not recognize.

ID=100150129
I agree. Given the way Miriam and Liu fall from the blanks,\nIt can be said that the appearance of that child is obviously strange.

ID=100150130
......

ID=100150131
Well, I promise not to talk about that!

ID=100150132
I could not explain by just how to install liver and communication skills ....\nIndeed, that girl has changed a bit.

ID=100150133
What happened to the people I knew, what happened to my town ...?\nIt looked like I did not have any interest.

ID=100150134
That's right. That girl ... I am not caught in the past.\nTo be precise ... I have not thought about the past.

ID=100150135
Although common sense as a human seems to be normal,\nIt seems that recognition of this heterogeneous "situation" is abnormal.

ID=100150136
As if ... within 15 years blank inside,\nIt seems that it has fallen with all education on this world.

ID=100150137
Like Kane Barrel and Benelis.\nNow I feel something close to that hypothesis.

ID=100150138
Those who were chosen as soul workers, the majority of past memories, which become anxiety factors,\nIs it "stripped" or "distorted" inside the blank?

ID=100150139
... Yes. It will not look like a human being.

ID=100150140
... Because of being chosen, will you even be given the qualifications to think about the past?

ID=100150141
Whatever, the existence that produces soul workers ....\nIt seems that you do not have compassion etc.

ID=100150142
Feelings to think of the past ... Although it sometimes crushes people,\nI will also let you get up again.\nIt is sad that you can not even give that opportunity.

ID=100150143
... There is nothing we can do for now.\nIt is frustrating but that is reality. But ...

ID=100150144
Sometime in Seoul workers ... Once you find a presence that plays their heart,\nWe will fight with full power.

ID=100150145
I will regain their past.

ID=100150146
That's right. It's "medical fortune Fortune" for them.\nNow ... let's just hope for the future of that girl.

ID=100150147
Yes ....

ID=100150148


ID=100150149
"Chapter 1: Awakening"\nThe end

ID=510015001
Oh. You can not be ....\n%username%! Right?

ID=510015002
Good afternoon, nice to meet you.\nIt is "Booker TV" which summarizes everything Bukkazu hand group.

ID=510015003
Miriam is talking about you ~.\nA stinky child will come to me so please let me know.

ID=410015001
By the way, Miriam still keeps black stockings ~?\nFuu, you understand the man 's Romant.

ID=210017201
Oh, please surprise me more honestly!\nMe is Vesi. In other words, it is not human! So I was surprised if I was surprised ~ ~.

ID=210017202
So Me will be the enemies of you and you ~.\nbat! Me is a traitor! I betrayed my family and came to the human side!

ID=210017203
Well, I am selling Abnaigi information on Vechi here ~.\nThanks to that, Me is here even if you are here ~!

ID=210017204
But, as a matter of fact, I was born. I can not go to places where there are many human beings.\nbat! Coco has its own taste so it is not bad ~! Naha Ha!

ID=210017205
......

ID=210017206
Just a bit! Please do not be so scared ~!\n... I have come.

ID=210017207
Well, I understand your feelings. A town where it got messed up, an extraordinary person in front of my eyes! There is no impossibility.\nBut, Me also has a job ~. How long will you stand standing for you ever?

ID=210017208
Coco is a lawless zone ~. It does not matter what the rule is ~ Sekai ~.\nIt is my job to collect items that are likely to become money here.

ID=210017209
It is a place where the influence of the blank is strongly acting, so reconstruction is meaningless ~.\nHowever, it is wide for waste and there is no choice but to go here to move to another garrison.

ID=210017210
As I said earlier, this is a lawless area so there is no accusation anyway!\nToilet with litter throwing away or a bit at a ... It is up to the mood of such a fir tree.

ID=210017211
... Of course, it also takes away our lives.

ID=210017212
Speaking of easy, it means "disorder" ~.\nThere is a narrow safe area in front of the garrison to make it more orderly here.

ID=210017213
Since there is a rule here only, please try acting domineering if you want to eat smelly meat ~.\nWell, I will not do such a thing, though.

ID=210017214
Anyways! Because it is such a zama, even if an ignorant man comes, it just drops the life ~.\nSo, the guide like Me is handling explanation and guidance ~.

ID=210017215
Well ... Let's keep basic education in the lawless area about this ~.\nThere is an idiot called Billy at Hutchi ~. Let me know the guidance of him ~!

ID=610017201
Me is a bit busy, so I'm not going to have time to guide you ~.\nToday is the day when radio prize winners are announced.

ID=610017202
Well, it is a bye - bye!

ID=310017202
Because I am listening to the radio, I am busy ~.\nGo even to that guy over there.

ID=100172101
Oh? What are you! !\nWhat a gun you Kora! What?

ID=100172102
Oy! I'm asking Billy the Junior how many guns I got Taco!

ID=510017201
... Huang? It's a boss's guest?\nIf so, say it so!

ID=510017202
I am Billy.\nKora is an executive of the Buckers' team. Remember!

ID=510017203
Huang? Boss ask me to guide you! What?\nDo not you see it? I do not like to guide you As much as I do not know the way is complicated Kora! What? Oh?

ID=510017204
Do not tell everything until you do not care about people like you! What?\nOr are you fighting or selling fight! What?

ID=510017205
... A? Have you woken up soon?\n... From the blank?

ID=510017206
......

ID=510017207
Huh, huh! That's why you kara!\nDid you think that I will reflect on such a reason?

ID=510017208
And anyway! If you walk this way all the time, it is Kandus city.\nTake care from the danger while traveling ... Ha! Chi: Oh my, Kora! What are you doing, Tameya or Kora!

ID=510017209
Hey, Billy. Be quiet ~.\nI can not hear the radio.

ID=510017210
Sorry, boss.

ID=510017211
Anyway the road was taught. I have no choice but to do.\nAh? You can tell me if you are interested.

ID=510017212
Well, this is a mountain of treasure.\nLong ago many companies came in to try to rebuild here. There are still a lot of supplies left.

ID=510017213
That's why we are collecting it and selling it as a business.\nThere are times when it is useless, but there are more people at good times.

ID=510017214
I will let you help if you feel like that.\nJust a little seriously will make a good profit.

ID=510017215
Wow ~? Billy, it is rare, is not it?\nTo such a thing towards the first meeting? Does it feel you?

ID=510017216
Well, such a hobby is not it!

ID=510017217
Oh, is not it a star?\nNahaha ... Although it is a member of Buckers' Hand, in this regard ....

ID=510017218
Well, do not stop joke, boss!

ID=510017219
No\nI guess you heard rude remarks ... Is it due to mind?

ID=510017220
It is a matter of mind. I am fond of.

ID=510017221
Anyway, think about what I told you well Koraa.\nI do not think it's a bad story.

ID=410017201
Then, go to Kandus city quickly, help with work, or colla.

ID=210017401
Kandus city is straight on this road.\nOy, I knew it when I pull it off way, Kora! What?

ID=210017402
It is Kola. Afterwards, talk to the boss before you go.\nBoss, a man who does not have courtesy hate it seriously.

ID=310017401
Keep a greeting to the boss and Kora! !

ID=100174101
Did you decide to go to Kandus city?\nI was happy to see you. Please come and see me again ~!

ID=100174102
Oops, let's advise a word as a senior at a time for life.\nEvil will be given to everything ~. Please remember that only ~ ~.

ID=100174103
But if the body and mind are healthy, no matter what will come ~.\nEspecially when the heart is not strong ~! Because it is a moment to fall as you fall in love.

ID=100174104
See you again.\nPlease do come again! !

ID=510017401
You. Intercropper who Benjamin said ....\nNo, soul workers.

ID=410017401
You came often.\nAaron is appointed Starred Forest Coalition Commander at Kandusity.

ID=260063501
Oh, did you feel like doing work?\nThen go straight to the central area, destroy that fucking soul junk Kora!

ID=260063502
I've heard it a while ago, but I've been getting messed up with the effects of the blanks here.\nDo you know that it is? Kora! The degree of risk is Jae Ye!

ID=260063503
You can not kill it even if you crush it.\nThat's why we got in the way.

ID=260063504
Taste ... Looks nice and seems to be a bit strong, so please crush it!\nTo the peace of the sixth area bothersome or KORA!

ID=260063505
You.

ID=260063506
What is wrong?

ID=260063507
Even if Bora blows, no fraud is useless Mee said many times?\nI guess I should explain it to Sassa, if I have to catch a bunch.

ID=260063508
... Check.

ID=260063509
Seoul Junk in the sixth area actually is strongly receiving the influence of the blank,\nIt seems that blank substances are accumulated in the body.

ID=260063510
What was it ... all the things that were affected by the blank are blank substances sticking together\nDefine this as being affected by the blank ... Aaa!

ID=260063511
Anyway, we can have blank crystals in their bodies only in the 6th area!\nWhat is it? Well like a stone can be inside the body. Do you understand Kora!

ID=260063512
Get it! I do not understand it well, but the laboratory and its relationship buy it at a high price.\nIs it an important monke revealing the secret of the blank?

ID=260063513
... Do not look with such eyes Kora! I will bring it properly ....\nDo not doubt that! What? Oh! What?

ID=660063501
I'll wait for you to do it Kora kara Kara.\nBecause we decide whether to leave work from now on depending on how we do this, please spirit!

ID=360063501
Do not forget blank crystals Kora!

ID=560063501
Oh? What is this?\nI brought a blank crystal ... ... Who was the one who brought the debris! What?

ID=560063502
Oi look Kora. I am proud that I'm strongly messed up,\nNevertheless ... Oh? How can I use such a colla! What?

ID=560063503
... Well, you can not do it.

ID=460063501
Next time try to get out more power.\nBut first thing is fine. I will do it.

ID=460063502
This ... ... a good duck ... No, it seems they found a customer.

ID=460063503
I'm a bit worried, but I guess it's okay to leave the job officially to this extent?\nWell, you can tell me when you want to work from now on. I will tell the boss.

ID=220001001
Are you ready?\nWell then, I'd like a little scary ~.

ID=220001002
Everyone handled that soul junk,\nPlease bring blank fragments ~. Easy, right?

ID=220001003
Well then, start.

ID=320001001
Colossee soul junk looking so fast,\nBring me blank fragments ~!

ID=520001001
That's kind of tough! Um ... the amount is great.\nQuality is also good ... is not it?

ID=520001002
Thank you ~.\nPlease again ~!

ID=220001501
This request is to destroy Seoul junk.\nYou do not have to explain it! What? It 's good to be crushed ~ You're crushing ~!

ID=220001502
It means that we do not mind Beck's hands.\nI will not want to see the face, too!

ID=220001503
Oraora! Go ahead! Kora!\nNothing to the guy who is fucking!

ID=320001501
This request is to blow Soul junk!\nAnyway, it is really nice.

ID=520001501
Whoa, did you come?\nI heard that the streaks are good. It is anticipating ants.

ID=520001502
If you are willing to work again, come any time!

ID=220002001
Do you know Deekhe in Seoul Junk?\nI thought that it was stupid only for Decake, but it is quite a challenge.

ID=220002002
I got an invite from the Buckers' team,\nI got totally wrong without teeth at all.

ID=220002003
Veteran something is not a hobby, but thought, looking at the idea changed my mind.\nIf you do, you will be able to get away with the dead enemies ....

ID=220002004
... They are living in a delectable life and they have died of stupidity.\nBut ... yeah, I'm sorry. Is not it?

ID=220002005
This is a request of individuals to the last. You should decide whether to accept it.\nWell if you do not take it I will resist your life for a long time.

ID=320002001
Also in Seoul junk I heard from Dekhe.\nKill the guy ahead of time Kora!

ID=520002001
It's so frustrating that you can rest, do not you?\nBecause ... they are pitiable.

ID=520002002
Though they were pointing backwards from the world, they did wrongs as bad things ....\nMaybe you can pray about Islam and so on? Hey?

ID=260005501
Miriam seems to have been taken care of.\nIt is truly that it is soon after waking up.

ID=260005502
It's Ryo. I met you once.\nI was saved at that time. Grateful.

ID=260005503
It seems I am not used to this situation yet.\nOf course. The period of 15 years can not be so easily filled.

ID=260005504
You can not afford it, but you should meet with the merchants.\nIt is such a world. You have to rely on them to buy decent things.

ID=260005505
To live in this world, trading with them is essential.\nThere is also a way of self-sufficiency, but ... it will still be a little early.

ID=260005506
Take this.

ID=660005501
Tritiated rough stone.\nThis is a metal that is compatible with Seoul Energy.

ID=660005502
We have no ability to refine this ....\nHowever, it is a popular item traded at high prices among merchants.

ID=660005503
Give this to Yomi of a miscellaneous merchant.\nIn the meaning of asking for my best regards from now on ... That's right, it is like a greeting.

ID=360005501
Give this to Yomi of a miscellaneous merchant.\nIn the meaning of asking for my best regards from now on ... That's right, it is like a greeting.

ID=760005501
You will regret it?\nSuch opportunities are not so.

ID=600055101
Welcome.\nAre you looking for something?

ID=600055102
Ah ... maybe it is Tritonium Ore?\n... Do you want to buy?

ID=600055103
...... How much is the selling price supposed?

ID=600055104
Present? To me?

ID=600055105
... There are such words among merchants.\n"There is nothing higher than free things" ... Why is this to me?

ID=600055106
... Would you like to say hello ... Well, it is doubtful ....\nOh, maybe you ... Recently I was a rescuer who rescued from the blank?

ID=600055107
Oh, I see. Is that something like that?\nThis is what the coalition does whenever a new interrogative comes.

ID=600055108
I am "Mr. Yomi" in charge of miscellaneous goods belonging to a merchant association.

ID=600055109
Our merchant association was organized after the blank,\nIt is the union of merchants as the name suggests.

ID=600055110
Due to the war, most production facilities are concerned with the production of military supplies.\nDue to that, daily necessities and medicines are always missing.

ID=600055111
The organization that we could do to solve such a situation is "Merchant Association".\nRegardless of old goods, handmade goods, means and methods, we have essential necessities.

ID=600055112
And sell it.\nThis is all.

ID=600055113
The reason for forming the coalition purposely is that,\nIt is for some people trying to gain outrageous profits because they are necessities for daily living.

ID=600055114
For such reasons, even in the crowdream, we merchant association\nI have got very high support. It goes without saying about credibility.

ID=600055115
The Merchants Association is sure to be helpful to you.\nThank you in advance.\nWe also receive gifts thankfully.

ID=600055116
If you have time, please visit the jute who is in charge of weapons.\nI think that there is no loss by knowing him.

ID=560005501
Goodbye!

ID=460005501
... Hmm? Oh? Customers ... Is that a different person whom I was rescued by a blue night strategy!

ID=260006001
Ha ha ha! Hope to see you soon!\nI'm the weapon's affiliation "Jite" belonging to the merchant association!\nLater on ...

ID=260006002
Even so, that day was amazing.\nIt was enough to hear a blast from here too.\nThat's just a fierce battle.

ID=260006003
Oh, I do not like foreigners. Sometimes my life has been saved,\nIt is not easy to put a life to protect something.

ID=260006004
Well, it's not like I will reward it,\nI mainly sell weapons that are useful for battle.

ID=260006005
No matter how good you are,\nThe majority of the union is composed of ordinary people.\nThere will be limits.

ID=260006006
Various firearms, as well as landmines, trap supplies etc!\nPlease look into it! I will make it cheap!

ID=260006007
Your % userweapon% ... Are you sure?\nWell, yeah. I sure treat it.

ID=260006008
Sounds funny. If a different person uses weapons,\nIt is rather a story that the fighting ability drops sharply.\nOh, that's right.

ID=260006009
There used to be an interrogative who used weapons long ago.\nIt is not a different person ... Seoul ... What is it?\nAnyway, it was a different calling method.

ID=260006010
It seems like I had lost my life or got missing while in battle, but ...\nI remember that it was specially treated in the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=260006011
Well, we will prepare as much as you want, if your request!\nActually, I am troubled with a little disposal. Ha ha ha!

ID=260006012
Customers, apparently seems to be in the middle of the traditional Falcon Forest Alliance tradition,\nThere are only two people merchant of Locotown, yomi and me.

ID=260006013
So ... let 's introduce Odon.\nYatsutsu who works for Crow Dream Alliance Bank.

ID=260006014
I hope to see you once.\nThen, please give this one.

ID=660006001
Membership card of Crow Dream Alliance Bank.\nGoods with a little value though ... but well please think that it is a gift.

ID=360006001
Please go to the place of Odon.\nKnowing, there is no loss.

ID=760006001
Ha ha ha! There is a talent that makes you say the same thing over and over!

ID=600060101
Hello.\nIt is the Crow Dream Alliance Bank that protects your wealth.

ID=600060102
I heard from Mr. Jite about the story.\nThe intercalary who was rescued from the blank a while ago was you.

ID=600060103
But it seems not to be just a different ability to tell from the weapon you have.\nSoul worker ...?

ID=600060104
my mother. Those who deal with money can take this level of course as a matter of course.\nOh, please do not worry so much.

ID=600060105
It is the guarantee of your property as well as secret,\nBecause we are the motto of the Crow Dream Alliance Bank.

ID=600060106
Oh, the greeting was delayed.\nMy name is Odon, the Western branch manager of the Crow Dream Alliance Bank.

ID=600060107
After the blank, the only surviving bank ... That is our Crow Dream Alliance Bank.\nThat's why it can be said that credibility as well as property protection ability is outstanding.

ID=600060108
Currently the money of the crow dream is completely unified.\nIt took time, but finally money started to be properly operated.

ID=600060109
Well, even though it is currency, it's just data.\nMy job is perfect storage and protection of your funds and goods.

ID=600060110
Storage period is indefinite.\nIf it is within the capacity permitted by the customer,\nYou can keep goods and money as much as you want.

ID=600060111
Hmm? Warranty on lost?\nThat's right ... I have not lost it so I do not understand well. Haha.

ID=600060112
It is said that we received a membership card from Mr. Jite, so I will register it soon.\nPlease come whenever you need.

ID=600060113
Please remember.\nThe Cloud Dream Alliance Bank, in any case, protects your property for the highest priority.

ID=560006001
Did you go back? You seem to be very tired.

ID=560006002
A lot of information came in at the same time. It is unreasonable.\nBut do not forget. It is very important here.

ID=560006003
There is something I want to talk a little more ....\nIt seems impossible for that situation.

ID=460006001
It was a pain.\nGet a little rest.

ID=260011501
Hehe, how was it?\nWas it useful?

ID=260011502
It can not be helped even if it seems dirty.\nHe, even if I do not do it, I do not move one eyebrow.

ID=260011503
Then, please accept this.\nIt is an HEMS recognition vote.

ID=660011501
... Ah, I did not know HEMS in the wake up.\nWhat is HEMS? Formally ... what was it ...?

ID=660011502
Anyways! With HEMS, you can exchange emails.\nIt is popular new mail system since old network line became useless.

ID=660011503
The great thing about this is that you can transfer mail as well as mail!\nIs not it? Before the blanks it is a dream technology that I could not even imagine.

ID=660011504
I do not know what principle it is ... but it is amazing anyhow!\nWar may develop science, maybe they are not wrong ....

ID=660011505
Hold the recognition card and register it on the HEMS terminal.\nIt's easy to use. Just hold it.

ID=660011506
Well then, I'll be waiting.\nPlease feel the power of the new civilization to the utmost.

ID=360011501
Come and register with HEMS.

ID=760011501
Hmm? What happened? Why are not you going? Is it a toilet?

ID=600115101
Thank you very much for using the high-speed transfer device "HEMS".\nScan your customer's identification card.

ID=600115102
Successful scan.\nI will explain the basic functions of HEMS from now.

ID=600115103
"Hyper · Express · mailing system (common name: HEMS)\nIt is a system that can transfer objects and money.\nWe will deliver your precious things safely, safely and quickly at low price.

ID=600115104
Also, it has an e-mail sending / receiving function.

ID=600115105
There is no restriction on the use of e-mail,\nYou can use it wherever HEMS is located anywhere.

ID=600115106
This concludes the explanation about the function of HEMS.

ID=560011501
Oh, come back. Did you ask the explanation properly?

ID=460011501
Well, please use it well from now.\nHave you repaid a bit with this? Haha.

ID=260009001
Hey,% username %% usergender_2%.\nHave you ever seen airplane?

ID=260009002
Setsuka, he has seen it.\nA big bird flying with the sky overlooking!\nIt's been awesome!

ID=260009003
Sessuka's daddy.\nEven those who move the aircraft, sister was saying.

ID=260009004
I also remember Setsuka.\nI was dressed like Liu uncle.

ID=260009005
Now, my job is busy,\nYou can only send letters to Sencha and Setsuka.

ID=260009006
Hey,% username %% usergender_2%. Sessuka, I'd like to see Dad.\nI told you I can meet you when I sleep 10 more times ....

ID=260009007
Sister says Setsuka cries when she wants to see her dad.\nYour face is laughing, she seems to cry.

ID=260009008
% username %% usergender_2%.\nLet me see you dad! Is not it? Is not it?

ID=660009001
I I can see you Dad!

ID=360009001
When will Dad come back?\nHey.

ID=760009001
why? I just wanna see you daddy ....\nEverything is useless ... Eh ....

ID=600090101
Is that so ... Setsuka like that?

ID=600090102
To Cayenne who is father of Ryoko and Secreta\nI was taken care of personally.

ID=600090103
It guided me to this path ... It is like a teacher.\nYou can say that it is a mirror of a soldier.

ID=600090104
Now in Grace City\nHe is active as an ace pilot of Heavy Gears.

ID=600090105
On behalf of the busy cayenne,\nI am taking care of Ryoko and Setuka.

ID=600090106
......

ID=600090107
... I know by myself.\nUnfriendly, difficult personality.\nI guess it is hard to put on a voice.

ID=600090108
Hmm? What if you change the way you treat two people?\nHow to contact ...?

ID=600090109
Haha. Is not it Ryoko to Setsuka?\nHave you had rice? If you have not already, why not go out for some delicious things together?

ID=600090110
......\nThat's impossible.

ID=600090111
It is extremely unnatural.\nBesides, I feel somewhat dangerous.

ID=600090112
It seems to only change slowly.\nI am trying hard, but ... I can not do that easily.

ID=600090113
To Sekkaka ... You have no choice but to speak as it is.\nIt is not good to make your expectations unnecessarily.

ID=600090114
If it is hard to say, how about asking Ryoko?\nThis should not have been once or twice.

ID=600090115
... It is somewhat cowardly but it can not be helped.\nChildren 's opponents will not serve anyone.

ID=560009001
Huh? Promise to make Setsuka meet Daddy ...?

ID=560009002
Why, why is that ....\nThis is a big deal.

ID=560009003
Setsuka has a strange persistent place,\nIt is not prey that I aimed at once, once I decide I will try to do anything.

ID=560009004
Haa, I thought it was finally calm again ....

ID=560009005
It is inevitable. I will do something, so please be relieved.

ID=460009001
It's okay. Believe please.\nBecause I am Setsuka's older sister.

ID=460009002
I think that Setsuka will cry,\nBut it's okay. Because it is usual!

ID=260015501
... Ha, I can not sleep at all.

ID=260015502
Since the Star Forest Alliance came to Loco Town,\nMy position is no better than falling to the ground, not to the sudden drop.

ID=260015503
As the only doctor in this town, I have done the best treatment with limited supplies ....\nThe Star Forest Coalition has ruined everything.

ID=260015504
People in the town will not come to me any more.\nYou can receive medicine prescription from the medical forces of the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=260015505
Separately it is jealous ....\nHowever, I think that there is no significance for my existence in this town ... I can not do it.

ID=260015506
Huh

ID=260015507
I'm sorry.\nCan you do it alone?

ID=660015501
......

ID=360015501
......

ID=760015501
Well, you imitate such a thing.\nDo not become sad ....

ID=600155101
Huh? Mr. Warren?\n... So you were so depressed.

ID=600155102
But that is the fact.\nDoctors in town have no choice but to specialize in folk remedies.

ID=600155103
It is different from us who is a "group" specializing in treatment.\nWe are aiming for quick and accurate treatment.

ID=600155104
However, Mr. Warren seems to make a big misunderstanding.\nWe can deal with diseases we understand earlier than anyone else.

ID=600155105
But in this era, it is not amusing for new disease to come out.\nIt is the "experience" of a doctor like Mr. Warren to rely on such a time.

ID=600155106
We are merely educated. Mr. Warren is an experienced one.\nThere is nothing better than experience in any age.

ID=600155107
I hope that it will not be so, but in the unlikely event of an unknown disease,\nThere is no way we can handle it.

ID=600155108
But what about Warren?\nDo you think that experience is useless?

ID=600155109
That is not the case.\nSo, would you tell me to have confidence?

ID=600155110
Someday ... The time will come when Warren's power is needed.

ID=560015501
... what?\nI want to be alone.

ID=560015502
... Sunny like that?\nReally. Perhaps it was my thought.

ID=560015503
It makes me feel easy if I say so.\nThe best thing is that no new disease will occur.

ID=460015501
Alright, I'm fine.\nWell then let's go get some experience today! Haha.

ID=260000501
Nice to meet you.\nAttention, Setsuka! you are?

ID=260000502
%username%?\nWell, it is a weird name!

ID=260000503
Setsuka lives with sister.\nMommy went to work in the country above the sky,\nDad is working in a big town.

ID=260000504
There were many children of the height about the same as Setsuka before,\nEveryone went far away. So, now I am alone.

ID=260000505
But, because Setsuka has a doll, I am OK.\nWhen Seitka is alone, he plays with me.

ID=260000506
By the way, I have seen a little doll in a noisy place.\nMy mouth got bigger but it was pretty cute to move a bit.

ID=260000507
So ... ne% username %% usergender_2%.\nSetsuka, I want that doll.

ID=260000508
Is not it? Is not it?

ID=660000501
Well, if you bring that doll, I will lend it to%username% as well!

ID=360000501
Dongdon In a noisy place, it is a small doll, a mouth bigger and a little drilling doll!\nSetsuka is waiting quietly!

ID=760000501
... Boo.

ID=560000501
Ah! %username%!\nIs there a doll? ... eh?

ID=560000502
Did not you bring it?\n... Was not it a doll?

ID=560000503
......

ID=560000504
A, ha ha! I just tried what% username %% usergender_2% really knew!\nOh, was not it fun? Is not it?

ID=460000501
Se, thanks to Setsuka I studied one, so please listen to me again!

ID=260001001
Dongdon There is a big doll in a noisy place.\nIt is true! It's really a doll!

ID=260001002
It is so big, if you sleep with a gue you feel comfortable!\nSetsuka is an adult so I can sleep alone.

ID=260001003
Because sister is not good unless there is still a secret.\nI give it to sister.

ID=260001004
So,%username%.\nGood? It is a bigger doll than before.

ID=660001001
Huhu, sister ... I hope you will be glad.

ID=360001001
It is a big doll more than before.\nDo not forget it?

ID=760001001
Se, Setsuka is not lying! It's true!

ID=560001001
Hehe, did you have a doll?

ID=560001002
Huh ...?\nWas it different again?

ID=560001003
Or, after all ....\nI thought he probably was a guy because he saw it in a dream ....

ID=560001004
Se, Setsuka is not lied! What?\nUh ... Uh ... u see ... fail? I just failed!

ID=560001005
O, sister was saying! Everyone fails!\nSetsuka is the same! I just failed!

ID=560001006
......

ID=460001001
I'm sorry ....

ID=260001501
Hey, you with a different ability.\nI am Warren. Rocotown is the only doctor.

ID=260001502
Before the Star Forest Alliance came here, I was doing all the treatment in the town.\nI do not even have a hospital now. It is a place like "Wandering doctor".

ID=260001503
Originally I ran a hospital in Grace City,\nI moved the hospital here thinking I want to save Loco Town.

ID=260001504
... But, I do not think so.

ID=260001505
Locotown is a pretty dangerous place.\nThat is why it is close to blank.

ID=260001506
Actually, the blank itself is already considered to be in a dormant state,\nThe problem is Seoul Junk overflowing from the blank.

ID=260001507
Those who are also called monsters are all enveloped in mystery.\nWhat is caused by the cause, what kind of ecology ... all of it.

ID=260001508
However, the most troubling species is a contagious disease.\nIt spreads out diseases that I have never heard ... Fuu, it just makes me sick.

ID=260001509
There was a time when Seoul Junk attacked a great deal here six months ago.\nAt that time, a popular infectious disease ... many of the weak children still ....

ID=260001510
... Fuu, at that time my hospital has also broken.\nUnless the Star Forest Alliance came,\nRocotown has disappeared from the map this time.

ID=260001511
However, now Seoul Junk is gathering near Rocotown.\nIn this way the past may be repeated.

ID=260001512
That precursor has already begun.\nTo the people in the town, a few but the same symptoms as infection at the time are beginning to appear.

ID=260001513
There is a huge wolf called the dread of control zone 43.\nWill you bring my brain? I think that is the cause of the illness.

ID=660001501
It used to be the same as before. A man who saw him ....\nIn other words, the disease developed in people who were close to him.

ID=660001502
Do you know the most effective way to win disease?\nThat's ... to prevent disease.

ID=660001503
In other words, it is necessary to cut off the cause.\nI'm counting on you.

ID=360001501
I want you to beat the wolf called dread and bring that core.\nIt is better to manage your concerns early.

ID=760001501
... Whether it is pity or pity ....

ID=560001501
It's safe and top notch.\nAfter all, my expectation was right.

ID=560001502
No one will appeal to the symptoms anymore.\nIt stopped like a lie.

ID=460001501
With this ... can you rest a little?

ID=260003001
Hello.\n"Ryoko" living in Locotown is said.

ID=260003002
I wonder when a new person comes here.\nIt is a small town now, but it seems to have been crowded with many people in the past.

ID=260003003
It seems there were many parks with many nature around Locotown.\nIt was famous as a healing spot for those who were tired of living in the city.

ID=260003004
However, since the space appears above the Remains Park,\nThere are also no visitors.

ID=260003005
On the contrary, locals are even in a different town ....\nPeople left here ... everyone likes home.

ID=260003006
It was surely a wonderful place that Rocotown of old times was not it. Huff.\nI am not born and raised in this town, so I am concerned about the old figure.

ID=260003007
Actually, I am aiming for reconstruction of Locotown together with the Star Forest Alliance.\nWork with me ... Oh, the job is fun. Everyone is a nice person.

ID=260003008
However, I also realize the difficulty of rebuilding.\nAs you can see, there is no such thing as anything proper.

ID=260003009
Well ... It is subtle to say such a thing to the first person.\nRecently I've heard that wolf hunting is frequent.

ID=260003010
Why do not you collect the wolf's hair, if possible?\nThe thing that exceeds the coldness is now the best selling point.

ID=660003001
Wow! Thank you!\nAfter all, my eyes did not go insane!

ID=360003001
It seems that the number of black wolves is the most.\nWould you pass me by with that hair?

ID=760003001
Well, uh ... oh, I'm sorry.\n... Excuse me.

ID=560003001
Huh? Um, this one ... I feel like I'm not hairy ....

ID=560003002
Have you become like this after pulling out your hair?\nOh, maybe ... was not a real wolf?

ID=560003003
Huh? So, was it Seoul Junk? What?\nI ... I do not even know that ....

ID=460003001
Well, sorry.\nI made it a useless hardship ....

ID=260004001
I heard that there is no doubt that Seoul Junk's correspondence has been made at this time.\nTherefore, there is one wish as a member of a merchant association.

ID=260004002
A while ago, I was hit by Seoul Junk while collecting parts in control zone 43.\nAll luggage is lost ... Probably to Seoul Junk's food ....

ID=260004003
There are a lot of expensive items ... everything must be collected.\nEven if it's impossible for everything ... some even somehow.

ID=260004004
You know that Seoul Junk absorbs everything around you?\nRegardless of organic matter, inorganic matter will be absorbed.

ID=260004005
However, because digestion takes time,\nThere is a possibility of recovering to some extent if it moves promptly.

ID=260004006
Please. Please collect parts that have not been digested yet.\nBefore it is completely absorbed and disappears.

ID=660004001
If my memory is right ... At that time, there should have been only cells and heavy cells around.\nWould it be okay if we managed to do something?

ID=360004001
Please collect parts of machines that cells and heavy cells have taken in.

ID=760004001
Be careful.

ID=560004001
eh? Have you already gone?

ID=560004002
Anyway ... Yeah, there are no damaged parts in particular.\nIt is better than I expected.

ID=560004003
It seems that you can sell at this price at this level.\nThere are some scratches ... Well it will be okay.

ID=460004001
Anyway, it was saved.\nOn behalf of the Merchant Association, I will thank you.

ID=260005001
%username%.\nThat ... I have a favor to ask.\nGive me some strength!

ID=260005002
I know I'm busy.\nBut this time it seems that it is not just a level that can be managed by us alone.

ID=260005003
Whether there is a prospect for maintenance of the control zone 43,\nNed Company resumed Seoul Energy extraction work.

ID=260005004
Oops, that explains what we are doing before that.\nI installed a boring machine in control zone 43 and raised the resources underground.

ID=260005005
That underground resource is Seoul Energy.\nHave you heard that much? It is a source of the power of a disparate person.

ID=260005006
Basically it's just an energy that can only be issued from different people ....\nIt's strange that it comes out even if the ground is dug.

ID=260005007
Anything ... Because this planet is also a living body in the end, it seems that Seoul Energy exists naturally ... or something.\nWell anyway, it was the moment I started working by moving the boring machine.

ID=260005008
... I got a figure revealed.

ID=260005009
Well, it was a foolish wolf ....\nI guess they are divided in half by black and white.

ID=260005010
What is bilibiri purple electricity from the body ....\nIt's different from ordinary Seoul junk anyway.

ID=260005011
This is surely the boss of the wolf. That was it from the atmosphere.\nYou can not afford to let such a guy go?

ID=260005012
It is not because you can not make money.\nFar from work as it is, even Rocotown is not dangerous.

ID=260005013
... There is only you.\nWho should I ask you to say so?

ID=660005001
ask.\nDefeat those wolves that thunder!

ID=360005001
Will you get rid of the thunderous wolf in the den of the mutation?

ID=760005001
Hey, hey! Think carefully! If you do not have a job you will only be starved!

ID=560005001
"Alright! I can start working this time!

ID=460005001
Thanks! Thanks to that I was able to resume my work.\nI'll treat you with good money when you get money. See you!

ID=260013001
Damn!\nIt seems like busy like a busy lately. Ha ha ha!

ID=260013002
I heard that they are playing the puppets.\nAutomatically moving dolls ... What kind of principle is it?

ID=260013003
Actually, both the merchant association and the Star Forest Association ... are suffering from lack of technology.\nHigh-level invested technology is from the military use.

ID=260013004
Anyway ... why can not you get the power devices of the puppets a little fool?\nIf you know what kind of principle it is, it will be useful.

ID=260013005
Rocotown, course, merchant association ... No, it may have an impact other than that.\nIt's the first technology I see and it's pretty much high tech.

ID=260013006
I'd like a power device for the doll.\nFor improving technical skills.

ID=660013001
Huh? How do you get power equipment ... Is that?\nWell ... well, for the time being I'll break it out, will not it come out?

ID=360013001
Please power device from R square dolls!

ID=760013001
Hey, I'm not interested in new technology! What?

ID=560013001
Well, is this a power device?\nlet's see ....

ID=560013002
......

ID=560013003
......

ID=560013004
This ... ... It seems like a normal electric power device.\nReceiving power ... just send out ....

ID=560013005
... It was just a mistake I made a mistake.\nI should have surveyed the core of the doll.

ID=560013006
Ha ha ha! But it's not a waste!\nI did not know that the doll's power system is an ordinary power unit!

ID=460013001
Ha ha ha!\nHa ha ... well.

ID=260008501
The momentum of the dolls is increasing day by day.\nThe problem is that there is no way to know where its starting point is.

ID=260008502
That scale in the form of a machine ....\nThere must be a facility to produce dolls in large quantities.

ID=260008503
But there is no way to figure it out.\nIt is also impossible to specify the place by the erasing method, since it does not know the material.

ID=260008504
If there is a possibility ... ....\nIt is to read out the route entered inside the dolls' body.

ID=260008505
It is clear that the final destination is Locotown.\nAfter that, if you know where the doll started acting ....

ID=260008506
You should be able to find their home.

ID=260008507
Will you bring the navigation of the dolls?\nIf you read the information in it, you may be able to grasp powerful information.

ID=660008501
Navigation will be attached to the military dolls.

ID=360008501
The doll having the role of a senior is a code name "Impuppet".\nTake navigation from them.

ID=760008501
Why refuse?\nIn the long run it's a mission.

ID=560008501
Is this navigation?\nWait a moment. lets search.

ID=560008502
......

ID=560008503
The route was entered securely.\nBecause the capacity is small, the action start point is erased.

ID=560008504
But ... it's close.\nEven the oldest information is near Rocotown.

ID=460008501
... I can not affirm,\nThe headquarters may be somewhat unexpected.

ID=460008502
... Just think about the emergency, just prepare your mind.

ID=260009501
... It is serious!

ID=260009502
It became a serious thing!\nSetsuka ... I began to make fun of it!

ID=260009503
I told you to let me see you, but why are you suddenly bad ...?\nYou say%username% will see you ....

ID=260009504
Sister's liar! Let me see you dad! Always ... well.\nIf Setsuka were to be his younger brother, he would hit a shot.

ID=260009505
Well yeah yeah!\nSister's lie! You mean mean!\nAlways only secret! Well!

ID=260009506
... Ah ah. Let me out so loud ....\nI heard that you can hear up to Grace City.

ID=260009507
Ue! ! Sister is stupid!\nI want to see my dad! Well! !

ID=260009508
......

ID=260009509
... Well, what will you do?

ID=260009510
... just kidding. It is impossible for impossible.\nIf we do not manage that pitiful child, Loco Town will remain noisy.

ID=260009511
Originally my family was at R square\nI ran a small clothing shop.

ID=260009512
It became messed up after the blank ....\nAnyway, there is our father's jacket there.

ID=260009513
It is a uniform of the Air Force, but Setsuka has its jacket as a favorite.\nIt was making noise that the appearance of Dad wearing it was smart.

ID=260009514
Someday I thought I'd take it if I had the chance.\nI can not go going because I am a doll.

ID=260009515
... You already know what you want to ask?\nI'd like you to bring my father's jacket from R square.

ID=660009501
I want to borrow the hands of a cat.\nIf you have that jacket, you can stop that whimsical devil.

ID=660009502
... Perhaps, I should not see my face,\nPlease pass it directly to% s from%username%.

ID=660009503
... Huh ....\nMy sister's care is troublesome.

ID=360009501
Please bring my father's jacket from R square.\n... This is a joint responsibility. If something solves it, peace will come.

ID=760009501
Wait a moment, please.\nDo not you feel responsible?

ID=560009501
Ue! ! You're a liar!\nAlways always ...!

ID=560009502
Gusatsu ... that? % username %% usergender_2%?\nDid you come to meet Dad?

ID=560009503
Lie to your sister, you can not meet Dad.\nI am so busy that I can not come and see Setsuka with my sister.

ID=560009504
Such a lie is not it? Right?

ID=560009505
that? that's ....\nIt's my dad's clothes! ! Wow ~! ! Nostalgic!

ID=560009506
To My dad's odors do.\nGood odor.

ID=560009507
... But you really can not see Dad?\nIs something really to say?\nAre you so busy?

ID=560009508
all right. I do not say selfishness anymore.\nWhen I want to meet my dad, I watch this clothes and I will gamble.

ID=460009501
... I want to see you in a dad ... ....

ID=260010501
Hello, everyone!\nI have something to ask you again today! Ha ha ha!

ID=260010502
According to what I hear, the source of the power of the doll is unknown,\nIt seems that the operating mechanism is not much different from ordinary machines.

ID=260010503
Then, we can also use parts used for the main body.\nWell, screws and sports ....

ID=260010504
So, I'd like you to pick up the nuts used in their bodies!\nNo, somehow Rokotown has a lot of nuts although there are many bolts.

ID=260010505
There are also many parts that can not be used because one does not fit.\nIt is a waste that you do not want to leave it, you want to find a pair.

ID=260010506
Please bring some doll parts.\nIt's enough if you have a nut! Rather, I want a nut!

ID=660010501
Best regards!\nIt's a nut! Do not forget!

ID=360010501
It is a rumor that blank puppets have nuts of high performance.\nI asked!

ID=760010501
There are so many bolts, there are no pairs and they are lost in the street.

ID=560010501
Oh! Nut is so much!\nIf it is crowded, the nuts will be more surplus this time! Ha ha ha!

ID=460010501
Huh? Where to use this ... Are you?\n... The time will come when to use one day!

ID=260012001
Hey.\nIs it reasonable to return it if you receive your grace?

ID=260012002
Well ... There were various on the way,\nAs a result I did not change to help you.

ID=260012003
Hey, it's not a big deal.\nIt's a one-on-one level.

ID=260012004
Ned company, soul energy from control zone 43\nYou know what to extract?

ID=260012005
Digging the land considerably deeply, but the ground of control zone 43 is too hard\nWe are lagging behind construction and extraction work.

ID=260012006
I can not fully support the equipment and materials of the equipment in such a country ....\nSo, you want to have doll parts procured.

ID=260012007
The ground of control zone 43 is sharply cracked.\nYou need sharp parts that can be screwed into the gap.

ID=260012008
Well ... I saw it with a glance, but a doll that is turning a sharp saw like a hula hoop.\nCould you please get his hula hoop. I will do the remodeling.

ID=660012001
... Huh, let's accept it unexpectedly.\nAfter all it is different from Eric.

ID=660012002
Huh? Did I do something wrong?

ID=660012003
... Anything.\nDo it at work, too.

ID=660012004
Is the group leader cuddly?\nI feel like I'm just playing from a little while ago ....

ID=660012005
... I can do it later! Do not mind, do it!

ID=660012006
It's easy and comfortable ~! Some people earn money by dropping sweat and working\nBecause some people will get a high salary only by standing out.

ID=660012007
......\nIt's a nice chick.

ID=360012001
Retrieve the parts of the R square square 's puppet.\nI will do the remodeling of parts.

ID=560012001
Did you bring it?\nHey, hey! It's not a danger! Be careful!\nIf you are not good, your fingers will run out.

ID=560012002
Fuu ... It is more durable than I thought.\nI thought that they would bring all the broken parts.

ID=460012001
... It is quite decent.\nGood job.

ID=260012501
Is that ... strange?\nWhere have you been so went so much?

ID=260012502
Oh,%username%.\nDo not you know the bolt that I put here?

ID=260012503
Oh, sorry. I do not know even if you ask yourself. my mother.\nBut it is strange. Where are they going even though they were there so much?

ID=260012504
......

ID=260012505
It was a bolt that I picked up for repair of the boring equipment, but it disappeared.\nI thought that I will use it later because there are not enough nuts.

ID=260012506
If there is a way to go to the R square, will you pick up the bolt?\nBecause the doll seems to use parts of the same standard as us.

ID=660012501
But I was in trouble.\nIs it a thief?

ID=660012502
Group leader. I guess I was embezzling again?

ID=660012503
... It is a thief treatment ....\nI feel like I fell to where it fell.

ID=660012504
Oh, already when it was released to Locotown ...

ID=660012505
... Stop. Hey.\nAlright for that.

ID=660012506
Here, this is this!\nPardon me rude torpedo ...!

ID=660012507
I guess I'm not quitting!\nTreat people as thieves! Does me look like that man! What?

ID=660012508
No way! Words should be used correctly!\nNormally, do not you know that the criminal is the first suspect of a similar crime?

ID=660012509
As a criminal! What?

ID=660012510
... The conscience hurts.

ID=360012501
Bloody ball ... was it? The bolt used for it seems to be high performance.\n... I do not even know where it was ....

ID=760012501
I'm so sorry\nI did not ask you to do such chores.

ID=560012501
Your Are the bolts stacked?\nI wish you naught me to put a clip of the headmaster.

ID=560012502
I am not!

ID=560012503
Mind generously.\nPeople are going to fail.

ID=560012504
How many times to say different ...!\nHey! I can not hear you pretending that!

ID=560012505
People should not sin. Do not you think so?\nSin is the same as chocolate, and once you put your hands on it you can not stop.

ID=560012506
... Chit, say it without permission.

ID=460012501
... The conscience hurts.

ID=260014001
I have a request.\nIt is something I was asked directly from the merchant association.

ID=260014002
Do you know that R square was a famous shopping street long ago?\nWe had all kinds of things.

ID=260014003
Therefore, after the blanks, many people raised daily goods from the R square.\nNevertheless, many items remain in R square.

ID=260014004
It is no exaggeration to say that it is a treasure warehouse.\nMerchant cooperatives are also regularly sending procurement units to secure items.

ID=260014005
As expected, people in Loco Town should be able to live for about two years per building.\nEven food and whatever.

ID=260014006
However, it unnecessarily breaks around the building with such worth\nThere is an ignorant doll.

ID=260014007
Although the intelligence itself seems to be low only in the body of the deck, the building in front of you\nThe information that one is breaking one after another is coming in.

ID=260014008
According to the explanation above, every time a building collapses, our lifetime is about 2 years shrinking.

ID=260014009
The vandalism still continues.\nIf you do not stop this, serious damage will come out.

ID=260014010
Is this ... a request as a merchant association ...?\nI am also a reliance as an individual.

ID=260014011
Well, the town itself is not a big deal, but everyone is a nice person.

ID=260014012
If all of them ... can live for a long time ....\nThat's all there is to it.

ID=260014013
If you have the same idea, will you accept this request?

ID=660014001
So, thank you.\nPlease do your work well.

ID=360014001
Doll destroying the building ....\nPlease destroy that doll.

ID=560014001
I got a report.\nI also confirmed the extinction of the target.

ID=460014001
Thank you very much.\nI will never forget this as a member of the Merchant Association.

ID=260016501
Um ... did not you see a doll that burns fire in a ruins hospital?

ID=260016502
Setsuka saw a doll that burns fire.\nPerhaps, I think I saw it with a soldier's educational video ....

ID=260016503
... I am also making noise as I want to burn fire.\nIt looks cool looking ....

ID=260016504
Because I will not ask even if I say no,\nI was knocking on you ....

ID=260016505
Then it gets a little more and I do not talk with myself.\nDo not know my feelings ... well, I will take care of you.

ID=260016506
Well, could you lend me some help?

ID=260016507
Please pass the tank called "fire pocket" which the doll has to Setsuka instead of me.\nDo not forget that from me.

ID=660016501
... Excuse me.\nI got involved in a sister fight.

ID=360016501
Please pick up the pocket of the flame that the fire-breathing doll has.\n... Please do.

ID=760016501
Eh ~, even though Setsuka is making a big noise ....

ID=560016501
... what? What is it for Setsuka?\nSetsuka is now in bad shape.

ID=460016501
... Huh? Sister?\nA flame pocket ...?

ID=260017001
Sentence. That's good.\nI will accept Setsuka because he is an adult.

ID=260017002
Adults are ... Kuru? Cool ... Yes, even cool it was Ry's uncle.\nBecause Setsuka is an adult, she acts cool.

ID=260017003
But how do you use this?\nI wonder if this is all it is?

ID=260017004
(I told you that you need an ignition system if you fire the Setsuka)

ID=260017005
......

ID=260017006
Sister is making fun of Setsuka!\nI apologize and pretending to tease!

ID=260017007
Ue! Sister is stupid!\nPechapai and my heart is narrow stupid!

ID=260017008
(... let's get an ignition device and get it from Ryoko)

ID=360017001
Ue! Sister is stupid!

ID=360017002
(Get the ignition device from Bloody Puppet and give it to Ryoko)

ID=760017001
(I can not refuse in this atmosphere ...)

ID=560017001
Oh, what the heck was that?\nSetsuka is crying so much that Rocotown seems to crack ....

ID=560017002
Huh? This is ...? Ignition device?

ID=560017003
... Are you angry because you can not put a fire on fire pocket alone?\nHa ... it seems that the story got confused again.

ID=560017004
understood. It is my responsibility.\nMy head did not turn to that point.

ID=560017005
I am bad.\nHaha. Everything is bad for me.

ID=560017006
......

ID=560017007
Mad!\nI will educate you tightly!

ID=560017008
(Ryoko went toward Setsuka with an amazing form)

ID=560017009
......

ID=460017001
... The hardship has endured.

ID=260017501
In the course of searching clowns of blue flames,\nMany people lost their lives.

ID=260017502
They were all important to someone.\n... Also for us ....

ID=260017503
I want to honor their death.\nIt may be a meaningless act, but I do not think so.

ID=260017504
Courtesy to a fellow who fought together.

ID=260017505
... If you agree with my idea, would you please find their identification card?\nI want to build places to honor them, as they can be small.

ID=660017501
Thank you.\nI'll be waiting.

ID=360017501
There must be a recognition card of soldiers who lost their lives.\nI do not have to be treated seriously.

ID=760017501
It can not be helped.\nI feel like I will see you again somewhere.

ID=560017501
You came down to find it.\nThis ... ... everyone's recognition card ....

ID=560017502
In fact, there is no need for an identification tag if there is present technology.\nAll you have to do is save the data and store it.

ID=560017503
Nevertheless, to use an identification card still\nThere are two reasons.

ID=560017504
First, when I lost my life by Seoul Junk,\nIt means that the cell sequence has changed completely and I can not grasp my identity.

ID=560017505
Weak Soul Energy is incorporated in this identification card,\nIt is not fused with soul junk.\nSo you can identify your identity.

ID=560017506
The second reason is ....\nTo hand over to the bereaved families.

ID=560017507
You can say that it is a relics ....

ID=560017508
... this era. I do not know when and where it happens.\nIronically, from the moment I receive the recognition vote, I have to prepare for "death".

ID=560017509
... I feel weird. I will get what I will become belongs to as a soldier soon ....\nThat 's the only place that is close to life and death.

ID=560017510
......\nThe story got longer.

ID=460017501
Thank you for finding out the recognition form.\nI hope everyone will ... sleep peacefully ....

ID=260019501
Welcome!\nOh! Good timing goods! There is a little wish!

ID=260019502
Actually, I decided to compete with Yomi ....\nWhich first brings rare things is content.

ID=260019503
At first it was a light feeling ....\nThere were a couple of things ... Seriously it became a game! Ha ha ha!

ID=260019504
That is what it means!\nMy muscles do not forgive me for forgiving my boastful muscle and keep silent!

ID=260019505
I will not lose face with me if I lose to such a cheeky guy!\nWill not you give me the power! What?

ID=660019501
As expected! Because the customer is a fan of this muscle, I believe that I will definitely lend you my strength!\nWhat I'm looking for is just fine!

ID=660019502
A bomb carried by the doll! Although the power of explosion is tremendous, do not use fire!\nI think that its oddity has the same value as my muscles!

ID=360019501
Will not you bring a bomb thrown by a doll!\nIt is dangerous to deal with sneaky, so be careful!

ID=760019501
Well, is that true?\nwhy! Why is that why? (Muki)

ID=560019501
You brought me!\nThat's right! If there is this ... ha ha ha!\nYomi 's regretful face floats in my eyes!

ID=460019501
I will kneel down in front of my muscular boast!\nWait a minute ... Yomi!

ID=260020001
Good! %username%.\nHave not seen you recently?

ID=260020002
According to what you hear, you are against a new doll?\nI feel like I do not have time to rest.

ID=260020003
Well, it's bad when you are busy ... That's a matter of asking.\nThere is a mon which you want me to pick up from that doll.

ID=260020004
I want to apologize to Shaun's group leader.\nI heard that you had done too little for now.

ID=260020005
There is a guy who keeps his tongue all the time with a doll, right?\nI want him to bring his tongue.

ID=260020006
......

ID=260020007
... I know what I want to say, but he is a hobby of the group leader.\nWell, someone who is not a bit kind of like that, is not it.

ID=260020008
After all it is a bad hobby? But it seems that there are no eyes on bad colors,\nI can also get myself to give such a gift ... The hobby of the group leader is Sore ....

ID=260020009
... I thought that I was deceived and ask!

ID=660020001
Only you are the only one.\nSomewhat disgusting ... I'm glad.

ID=360020001
A doll that is tongue out. Certainly ... was it "plan puppet"?\nBring me with his tongue!

ID=760020001
Oh, it is useless?\nbad. Forget it.

ID=560020001
Did you go back?\n... sorry. It bothered me in various ways.

ID=560020002
OK, well then, do this ... this way ....\nI can do it!

ID=560020003
Group leader!

ID=560020004
... What?

ID=560020005
it's a present! Please receive it!

ID=560020006
Present?\n... I do not need it.

ID=560020007
... How about getting a little honest?

ID=560020008
Hmm, I can understand even without looking at such a thing. I do not know what to do.\nI am busy. Do not use useless physical strength.

ID=560020009
No, it is not terrible to say such a thing before receiving it?\nCan not I believe so much?

ID=560020010
Ha ha, what have you said?\nRemember the things Teme has done until now!

ID=560020011
So you are trying to apologize!

ID=560020012
So, I guess you do not need it!

ID=560020013
Kono ...! I do not understand ya!\nIgnoring the sincerity of a person ... desperately!

ID=560020014
Your Have you issued nature as early as possible? What?\nWell, if I have a personnel right in me, I will fight it now!

ID=560020015
Anyway! ! ! Is not it so much?\nHan! Unknown ya ya after all the instrument is different!

ID=560020016
Te Tae! Try it once more!

ID=560020017
I do not understand ya! I do not understand ya!

ID=560020018
Hey, hey! !

ID=560020019
......

ID=460020001
... Stop it.

ID=260023001
Recently I feel like I have not seen everyone's smile.\nIn such a situation it may be unavoidable ....

ID=260023002
But, I used to laugh a lot in the past.\nRecently we have only dark faces and angry faces.

ID=260023003
Fuu, you do not want to be disgusted.\nI wish I could all laugh and spend it ....

ID=260023004
That ... that clown is a job of offering laughter, is not it?\nHow can all of us laugh?

ID=260023005
If I know how to do that, I think that smiles will come back to everyone.\nDo not you think so?

ID=260023006
So ... I do not know the details, but listen to me that you know a clown.\nWould you please check the secret of laughter?

ID=260023007
Please. Even know that ....\nI want to get a smile back to Loco Town!

ID=660023001
Oh, thank you!\nThank you! I will be waiting!

ID=360023001
I heard that he was acquainted with a clown.\nPlease investigate what the secret of laughter is!

ID=760023001
That ... ... "Does laughing come for good?" Is not it ...?

ID=560023001
Welcome back!\nhow was it? The secret of laughter ... Do you understand?

ID=560023002
... eh?\nOh, strife ... is it? Does a person smile when fighting?

ID=560023003
......

ID=560023004
That person ... Are you OK?

ID=560023005
And anyway I understood.\n... fight ... battle ....

ID=460023001
... Fight ... ... fight ... wow ...?

ID=210015501
During the battle with the Big Puppet, there was a doll that had attacked inside the Loco Town.\nFortunately the dolls were able to be controlled with minority without causing damage.

ID=210015502
The doll was completely different in appearance and behavioral pattern from the doll that fought at R square.

ID=210015503
We judged that the second power of the doll existed, and the direction in which the doll invaded\nWe intro- duced the satellite scan and investigated.

ID=210015504
However, there are no such achievements.\nNo, I can say that at all.

ID=210015505
In the relevant area, a unique wavelength which does not exist in the database has occurred.\nNot only satellite scan but also simple communication waves are blocked.

ID=210015506
We dispatched a search party to confirm directly, but have not come back yet.\nIt seems that something has happened.

ID=210015507
What happened to you in the operational area ....\nOr, please check what is going on.

ID=210015508
All decisions on site are left to you.\nCollect as much information as possible and return it.

ID=610015501
Stop all communication equipment of Loco Town from this.\nFocus all of this margin on building a communication network between you and the operator.

ID=610015502
no time.\nDo not forget to search for the search team and to gather information first.

ID=310015501
Ask for a search for a search party that entered the source of the unique wavelength.\nStrategy area name ... I'm thinking now.

ID=100160101
(Obviously it is a human being when checking it in the neighborhood, it is as hard as a stone statue)

ID=100160102
(It seems it got settled while running away)

ID=100160201
(Blue jewels are buried in a solid body)

ID=100160202
(This seems to be not a problem, let's report it to Benjamin in a hurry)

ID=510016001
Did you go back?

ID=410016001
The situation is being heard from the operator. Huge object ....\nAnd those who caked like stone statues ... It is strange outside.

ID=210016501
It seems that the analysis result of head office concerning the unique wavelength exactly came out.\nIt seems to have something to do with people like stone statues.

ID=210016502
Those who went to ask directly rather than going through me talk fast.\nWe are transferring the report to Sunny. Just go and check it.

ID=610016501
The clown of the blue flame seems not to be overworked by Roco Town suppression.\nHowever, we have prepared this assumption after blank.\nI can not lose.

ID=310016501
Listen to survey results of unique wavelengths from Sunny.

ID=100165101
I was waiting. I just finished reading the headquarters' report.\nThis time it is a report on how to fight with bears.\nI was wondering how to use magic as a weapon.

ID=100165102
Oh, what the story is, the reports coming from the headquarters are all encrypted.\nPlease hide the cipher in everyday content. For confidentiality maintenance.

ID=100165103
There is an analysis of the analysis. Anyway the sentences themselves are interesting.\nIt seems there are some people with a good sense in the headquarters. Giggle

ID=100165104
......

ID=100165105
Oh, sorry. I wonder if he was crazy alone?

ID=100165106
I summarized the contents of the report.\nFirst of all, the unique wavelength seems to be the same pattern as the wavelength from the Temptation Stone.

ID=100165107
This is a radio wave, it only shows effects to humans.\nIt cures the body of a radio wave and stops physical activity, the last takes away his life.

ID=100165108
The principle is simple. First, coagulate human blood and stop physical activity.\nAnd when radio waves act on the coagulated blood again, the petrification will proceed.

ID=100165109
As petrification proceeds, after a certain period of time it will not be possible for humans.\nBiologically, traces of human beings can not be found anywhere.

ID=100165110
According to your partner, a piece of Temptation Stone\nIt seems that it was embedded in the petrified body.\nI guess this is probably a kind of process to create a doll.

ID=100165111
Give inanimate a false life ... because that is the role of the Temptation Stone.

ID=100165112
The contents of the report are over.\nWhat do you need to do now ... You do not have to tell me, do you?

ID=100165113
Please report this content to Major Benjamin.\nThen ... Warren was kneading Dada a while ago.

ID=100165114
Now, I do not want to know what is going on.\nOf course you should know as a single doctor. Please tell him.

ID=510016501
I'm waiting. What is going on in a locality town?

ID=410016501
... Humans settled down to dolls ...?

ID=210017001
The blood of the people who took the radio wave was hardened, the physical activity was stopped,\nIn the end it has become no different from the doll ... or?

ID=210017002
I see. Recently it is heavy body at Loco Town,\nMany people complained about the symptoms that limbs were stiff.

ID=210017003
I have no signs of healing after prescribing anything. I wanted to know the cause.\nFortunately the situation was not that serious ....

ID=210017004
The troublesome thing is that the state of people complaining of symptoms is getting worse.\nI do not know where the source of radio waves is, but it is surely affected.

ID=210017005
This is sick. It was full of malice.

ID=210017006
Are you going to solve this?\nThen tell Benjamin san about this thoroughly.

ID=210017007
Weak, but this malice is spreading to Loco Town.\nI need to know what will happen if I leave it alone.

ID=610017001
Even if you can eliminate the cause of this symptom, there is no guarantee.\nThere is a possibility that radio waves are accumulated in the human body.

ID=610017002
So ... hurry up.

ID=310017001
Please tell Mr. Benjamin about my story.\nIt seems to hurry but I am bad ... I asked for your regard.

ID=100170101
what? The number of people who complain of body sclerosis symptoms is increasing ...?\nDoes it mean that radio waves are affecting Loco Town?

ID=100170102
... It is a matter of time that Rocotown turns into a town of dolls.\nAlright. Then, there is no reason to take more time.

ID=100170103
We confirmed that radio waves are occurring from a specific point simultaneously.\nYou should see there is something to send radio waves there.

ID=100170104
The problem is that strange object, but in today's circumstances you can not do anything.\nFirst of all, it places top priority on suppression of its source.

ID=100170105
Basically all disabled people can not afford any disease ....\nIt is said that it is a kind of disease. Do not be discouraged.

ID=510017001
A doll speaking human language ... no matter what appears, do not be surprised.

ID=410017001
It seems that he is directing the doll near the object.\nIt is no doubt from the remarks of blue flames to clowns and those who follow him.

ID=210017501
From this, the code name of the doll with the dialog function is set to "Jack the King".\nAt the same time order the annihilation of his.

ID=210017502
Honestly ... that huge object, we can not do what we have now.\nI requested missile shooting support from Grace City, but it ended in failure due to the object wave.

ID=210017503
It is an electronic guided long range missile.\nEven in the vicinity of the object due to the influence of radio waves.

ID=210017504
What I can do now is to annihilate individuals that are considered to be commanders of dolls,\nIt is to wait until the head office finds a way to break through this situation.

ID=210017505
... There is no guarantee, but now we do what we can.

ID=610017501
Go to Miriam before the beginning of the strategy.\nIt seemed like something to say.

ID=310017501
Go to Miriam before the strategy launch.

ID=100175101
The annihilation of the doll speaking the words?\nWell ... no matter how much soul workers are you working a little bit?

ID=100175102
Oh, it's not a big deal ....\nOne thing ... I was going to tell him.

ID=100175103
... Do not throw your life off this time.\nGood? I will not forgive you if you do not do it! What?

ID=100175104
Hehu, come on, come on! be careful!

ID=510017501
... I can not grasp the situation, but it was a hard work anyway.

ID=510017502
I confirmed the remains of Jack the King.\nAnd that object seems to have completely lost functionality.\nWell, I guess it will be helped by a clown of a blue flame.

ID=410017501
Anyway, what is the purpose of the guy?\n... We can not understand Vesh 's idea ...?

ID=260024001
Hello,%username%.\nI have something I would like to ask you a question ... is it a little okay?

ID=260024002
Hehe, thank you.\nDo not you feel that ROKOTOWN has recently become noisy?

ID=260024003
Bad rumors are circulating around Rocotown in connection with the appearance of a new doll.

ID=260024004
I do not know the details, but according to what I hear ....\nIt is a rumor that "Ned Company and Star Forest did to prevent residents from migrating."

ID=260024005
Of course, this is a rumor that does not have root,\nI think that the residents understand to some extent ....

ID=260024006
In this situation, such rumors will flow through the Ned Company, the Starry Forest Alliance,\nIn turn, we are not even favorable for the Crow Dream Alliance Bank.

ID=260024007
So, in order for us to end this rumor, we\nWe installed a private camera near a strange object,\nI tried to prove what I did not have with this case ....

ID=260024008
Wandering around the object, Eh ... ... "Fjet puppet" ...?\nAnyway, how did the hordes of that doll found out? I destroyed all of the installed cameras.

ID=260024009
With this, I can not tell the truth to everyone.\nWill you destroy the doll directly with your power?

ID=260024010
If you can perfectly carry out this case, I will reward my remuneration.\nHow about?

ID=660024001
It was good. Then, please extinguish the Fijet puppet near the object.

ID=360024001
Did all Fijet puppets be annihilated?\nIf you have not done so yet we will do anything ....

ID=560024001
Thank you very much. It was worthwhile to believe and leave it.

ID=460024001
Would you please do this again.

ID=260024501
Um, I'm sorry!

ID=260024502
I have a favor to ask ...

ID=260024503
You know that the dummy has increased the restricted area?\nSo, I need a lot of fence for closing, stock has run out ....

ID=260024504
I also told Mr. Jite, but it took time to get things ....

ID=260024505
Um, did not you see the doll that had dragged the chain near the strange object?\nThe trailing sound is very noisy.

ID=260024506
Oh, noisy is not a problem, right?

ID=260024507
Well, that chain is! I wonder if it can be used as a substitute for a fence ....\nWill you come pick me instead?

ID=660024501
Thank you!\nEven if you find it, do not hand it over to others, do you? It is a promise?

ID=360024501
Again? I will say it again. Please give it to me.

ID=560024501
was it there?

ID=560024502
Wow, this chain is sooo hot ...! Well then this is for use ....\nWell, I can not call Jay - san ... ...? Ah, it is wrong!

ID=560024503
Yo, Ryoko. I brought a requested fabric! It is quite thick, but can you make winter clothes?\nOh? Hi! I did not even have%username%!

ID=560024504
Ja, Ja, Jite! Why now more ...!\nAh, Ahaah ... that, that is ....

ID=560024505
Hmm? what? What's the matter?

ID=560024506
(Explain the whole and all to the jite)

ID=560024507
Hmm? In case of a fence, before this, prepare for a wolf appearing on the bowling scene\nBecause it replenished, inventory is still remaining ...? Ryoko. Why did not you come to me ...!

ID=460024501
Wow! What on earth are you talking about? Aha, Ahahahaha!\nAnd anyway, thank you! %username%!

ID=460024502
Ryoko! Okay, you, you asked%username% because you are troubled! What?

ID=460024503
You are wrong!\nWell, that's why ... Aha, Ah ha ha.

ID=260025001
Is the job going well? %username%.

ID=260025002
I'm asked a little, but ... can you listen?

ID=260025003
Recently I'm making a workshop for weapon production.

ID=260025004
Because ordinary interlocutors do not use weapons, demand has been low and production itself has not been done either.\nIf I sold the leftovers, the sale is gone.

ID=260025005
That 's why I'm making a workshop by myself and making weapons.\nI can not make amazing weapons, but I can make moderate things.

ID=260025006
The problem is ... with high fever to use for making weapons ....\nIs not it normal to generate high heat using electricity?

ID=260025007
However, it is impossible to draw electric power in the current state of Locotown.\nEveryone is coming from less power.

ID=260025008
In this situation, I can not use electricity to make weapons ... I can not.

ID=260025009
I went to ask Yomi to lend wisdom,\nDo not look around and get rid of it ....

ID=260025010
Even though this Loco Town, Yomi only relies ....\nI'm sorry, can not you persuade Yomi instead of me?

ID=660025001
Are you going to do it? I will pay for it!

ID=360025001
Can not persuade Yomi yet?\nHey! There is time. Ha ha ha!

ID=600250101
Welcome. What are you looking for?

ID=600250102
Hmm? Another errand?

ID=600250103
For me ... Maybe you are related to Jite?

ID=600250104
......\nHaa ... I told you I was useless for the jite, but I asked you not to ask me ....

ID=600250105
That muscle stupid at all.\nWell, when will it be ....

ID=560025001
I told you it was useless many times ....

ID=460025001
... Fuu.

ID=260025501
It can not be helped. Actually, there is one generator, though ....\nIf you listen to my request, you can hand it over to the Jite. But this is the end!

ID=260025502
I will never help even if I brought all my wealth any more.

ID=260025503
So, I need something ....\nThere are dolls carrying large crystals near strange objects, right?

ID=260025504
I want the crystal that doll carries.\nI will hand it over if you bring it.\nhow is it? Do you do?

ID=660025501
understood. Then, please bring it if you get the crystal.\nIs that okay? It's in my place?\nPlease do not take it elsewhere.

ID=360025501
Again? Do you think it is better to hurry?\nToday's situation, such generators are rarely available?

ID=560025501
Hmm? That's not it ... It's not a "Temptation Stone"! What?

ID=560025502
How to do this ...! What?

ID=560025503
Wait a moment, please! Exchange generator and temptation stone ...! What?\nThat's impossible! Temptation stone is nothing compared to such a generator!

ID=560025504
I remember I asked you to get the doll's power equipment before! What?\nThat nuclear rock at that time is this Temptation Stone!

ID=460025501
If you examine it, it is important thing that you may be able to clarify the secret of the doll!\nWell, could you give me a while! What? It's a waste for someone Yomi!

ID=460025502
Anyhow, it was good that you did not get bored by Yomi.\nThis will be sent to the Star Forest Alliance for the development of human technology. Thanks!

ID=260027501
Ah! I came! Come over here a little!

ID=260027502
Setsuka, I saw Sugoi before this!

ID=260027503
This is Mr. Miriam 's naisho! Good?

ID=260027504
Setsuka, in a room where military 's birthday and sister are gathered, I saw a dolls full!

ID=260027505
I saw it with moving paintings! The doll was walking around and was playing with the ball?\nIs not it amazing? Is not it amazing?

ID=260027506
That's it. Setsuka wants that doll ...!

ID=260027507
Is not it? Is not it?

ID=660027501
Thanks! This time it's really a doll.\nPlease find it properly. Setsuka, I will wait quietly!

ID=660027502
(In this case, let's destroy the doll from one end ... ...)

ID=360027501
Not yet ~~~?\nBut Setsuka is waiting quietly ~!

ID=560027501
Oh, welcome back! What is your doll? Setsuka's doll ...!

ID=560027502
Well, did not you?

ID=560027503
Ho, really?

ID=560027504
Why are you always making sense ... Uooh ....\nRyoko Oshin says it is destiny ... Is this the destiny of Setsuka ...?

ID=460027501
......

ID=460027502
Well! I will go to Sessuka, Dad's place! ! Ue!

ID=260028001
Oh, just right. Actually, symptoms of unknown cause frequently occurred in Loco Town.

ID=260028002
A crew member who scouted the restricted area shows serious hallucination symptoms.

ID=260028003
Many of the crew who have fallen into hallucinations have made something, but while muttering tweets,\nI am desperately trying to head that strange object.

ID=260028004
According to the story of a member who had a light symptom, since the battle with the doll carrying the baggage,\nThat hallucination symptom appears. It is clear that the doll is related.

ID=260028005
If left as it is, there is a possibility that other crew members will fall into similar hallucination symptoms ....

ID=260028006
Sunny said that a different person like you seems to be strong against such hallucinations and diseases ....\nask! Please annihilate the doll. No, you just have to earn time to find a cure.

ID=660028001
I am saved. As a doctor, every time a situation occurs that can not do anything like this time\nI feel a sense of my helplessness. ... ask. Do something about that doll.

ID=360028001
What are you doing? Leave this to me, you ask for dolls.

ID=560028001
Did you manage it?

ID=460028001
To pay attention. With this, the members will be released from hallucination.

ID=260029001
Oh, it was just right. Do you have a favor?

ID=260029002
Jack the king who fought before was a doll ....\nYou seem to have intelligence no matter what you think.

ID=260029003
Manipulating the words ... It's a bit strange but I've also expressed my affection.

ID=260029004
Since the former is a doll, it is hard to think that there is something like a soul.\nPerhaps I thought that "emotions" were entered in the data chip ....

ID=260029005
In conclusion, I need that data chip.\nBecause it is highly likely that it is a high standard AI. For future research ... I wonder?

ID=660029001
Was good. Well then be careful not to damage the data chip.

ID=360029001
I understand that battle with dolls is hard. But this is for everyone ... try hard.

ID=560029001
How? Did you find it?

ID=560029002
Thank you. There seems to be no damage like this.\nI will immediately restore the "memory chip".

ID=460029001
I hope the stored content is important information on emotions of the doll ....\nWell you understand immediately.

ID=460029002
"Cook ... have you come to be a doll without sex or a stupid human fellow ...!"

ID=460029003
"The number of gifts for Edgar has increased again ... huh ha!

ID=460029004
Wait a moment ...? Why are there only recorded files?

ID=460029005
Confirm the other ....

ID=460029006
this is ....

ID=460029007
"Edgar! We are the lord! For Edgar-sama!"

ID=460029008
......

ID=460029009
Huh\nYou seem to be in vain. Only the content that the doll speaks is recorded.

ID=460029010
Is the harvest not pear ...? ... For now, sorry to trouble you.

ID=210018001
I heard that I woke up shortly, but already treats it as a hero in Rocotown ....\nIf it is Benjamin's recommendation there will be no mistake.

ID=210018002
Hmm? Miriam notes ...?\nHaha ... that he still has such a thing. It is glad.

ID=210018003
I will contact you later on Miriam.\nBother troubles such an old ... Thank you.

ID=210018004
I am tired from a long road. You better take a little rest.\n... I'd like to say ... but I do not have much time to spare.

ID=210018005
Currently, here Kandas City is surrounded by soul junk,\nI am in a state of isolation as well.

ID=210018006
The only road that can be moved is the road connecting Loco Town and Kandusity.\nThis situation, it is not easy to communicate with other areas, of course.

ID=210018007
There is no way to break through the current situation with the current force of Kandas city ....\nSo, when I contacted Rocotown ... you taught me the existence of you.

ID=210018008
I thank you for coming to help us.

ID=210018009
I want you to understand the circumstances that you must get to work as soon as you come.\nAs I said earlier, it is a tense situation.

ID=210018010
What you should do now is to receive explanations from the block.\nI will explain things carefully from now on.

ID=610018001
Block is in charge of the militia in Candas City here.\nIt may be easy to talk because it is the same age as you.

ID=610018002
By the way, although the block was strangely modulated today ....\nIt seems I was waiting for you to come.

ID=310018001
Listen to the explanation about the mission from the block.

ID=100180101
Oh, already. Why did not you come?\nEven though I thought about seeing what kind of guy ....

ID=100180102
... Hmm? What?\nThis place is not where children come. Go away. Good?

ID=510018001
... Wait a minute. You are ....\nMaybe, an example soul worker? A hero of Locotown?

ID=510018002
Hmm ... unlike the material, it is quite luxurious.\nIs it really a soul worker?

ID=410018001
Oh, I did not introduce myself yet.\nI am a Canddus city strategy "block". Please remember it soon.

ID=210018501
Oh ... ... 15 years from the blank? Wow, that was quite long.\nHow? What impression did you see the city after 15 years?

ID=210018502
Is not it amazing?\nOf course in a bad way.

ID=210018503
You may have heard from Colonel Aaron, but here it is about to destroy.\nNo, it is not an exaggeration to say that it has already been destroyed.

ID=210018504
Supply is cut off, and the soul junk guys appear one after another.\nEveryone ran away. But now I can not even run away.

ID=210018505
It is the worst situation.\nDespite this, why are you stationing here ...?

ID=210018506
Oh, it was not the time to talk about this.\nLater on for the rest. I will explain the task of you.

ID=210018507
The reason why supplementation to Kandas city was interrupted is because,\nThe coastal road which continued here is blocked.

ID=210018508
Even though it is the only way to connect with Grace City, Seoul Junk is OK,\nIt is difficult situation even with reconnaissance, supplementing.

ID=210018509
In other words, the supply route is already completely out.\nOf course, there is no power to resist Soul Junk sitting there.

ID=210018510
Did you understand? What you do is rush on the shore road,\nPoop on Seoul Junk that is occupying it.

ID=210018511
How? Easy, right? It's not as much as a strategy, is it?

ID=210018512
... It is a situation where you can only set up such a strategy even if you say a strategy soldier.

ID=210018513
What can I do? The situation is situation.\nWell then, the strategy explanation is here. Try going to Victor next place.

ID=610018501
I heard that you came, I seem to have been waiting a few days ago.\nWell, is not it bad to taste the feeling of idle?

ID=310018501
Come on, see him soon.\nIf you also do a handshake, are you glad and fainted?

ID=100185101
I was waiting. %username%?\nNice to meet you. I am Victor.

ID=100185102
I am studying soul junk at Kandusity.\nMy organization belongs to the Star Forest Alliance, but it is not an official crew member.\nI heard that I was a semi-member ...?

ID=100185103
Well, well I have not received formal training,\nBecause the former workplace is my workplace ...

ID=100185104
Anyway, I am honored to meet the heroes of Locotown.\nI heard a lot of your story from Mr. Sunny. That kind of child is the first time.

ID=100185105
... I do not know what it means ....\nWell ... I bet it's a good meaning. Haha.

ID=100185106
Though I was thinking to say a thank you, I got a story.\nThank you for coming to Kandusity again.

ID=100185107
Also, if you do not mind, will you meet "Catherine" of the daughter of Colonel Aaron?\nIt seems like I was waiting for you more than me.

ID=100185108
Oh, if you have something you want to know about Soul Junk!\nI will answer anything that I know.

ID=100185109
No, it's no problem. Let me explain to this machine.\nSoul junk is basically generated inside the blank.

ID=100185110
The environment inside the blank is naturally different from here, but how gravity works,\nI do not know what is contained in the atmospheric constituents.\nBut if I solve this with a mathematical expression ....

ID=100185111
(... difficult words and numbers that can not be thought of as human beings are flying around)

ID=100185112
...... I got the result.\nIf we substitute a formula using blank gravity law here ....

ID=100185113
(It is dangerous if I stay here any more. Let's meet Katherine soon)

ID=100185114
that? Where are you going? I have not finished the explanation yet.\nI explained about 10% now, so if you ask me a little more,\nYou can be a good Doctor of Soul Junk.

ID=100185115
(... Hurry up)

ID=100185201
Wow! It really came! You are a soul worker who made a big success in Loco Town, is not it?\nWow ... I am the first time to meet real soul workers!

ID=100185202
Do you use that weapon as a medium to demonstrate different abilities? Wow, Hoh!\nWell, may I touch it for a while?

ID=100185203
Well, why? It is not going to decrease, is it?\nOnly once! One finger! No, even claws alone! Is not it? Is not it?

ID=100185204
Whoopee! !

ID=100185205
... Ah.

ID=100185206
Sho, I'm sorry for meeting you for the first time!\nI say, Catherine!\nIt is my daughter who has a mustache.

ID=100185207
It's small, it looks like this and is a different person?\nIt is not yet strong, but ... I will surely become a coalition ace!

ID=100185208
And let us join in the fight together and become a coalition star!\nThat name also ... "Two-star star"!\nDo not you feel excited just by imagining?

ID=100185209
I will definitely realize it soon so please wait a bit more!\nPlease do not go far in the meantime, do you? Hehe.

ID=100185210
I was happy to see you!\nActually I'd like to talk more ... Because my eyes are sore.

ID=510018501
... It seems it was prolonged as I thought.

ID=410018501
... ... It was a hard work.

ID=210019001
As I have heard, Catherine is my daughter.\nTemporarily caught in the blanks, it was miraculously rescued two years ago.

ID=210019002
That's why I got a different ability. Originally it is a personality that I can not keep as a jig,\nI want to help everyone with that extraordinary power, I am working hard on my own.

ID=210019003
However, as a result it is one that exacerbates the situation.\n... It is unfortunate that the dead did not come out now when I think about it.

ID=210019004
Because I do not have excellent ability, I can not become an official member either.\nOn the contrary, it is about to be treated as a trouble maker inside the coalition.

ID=210019005
So, always there is no choice but to monitor directly in my reachable eyes ....\nIt would be hard for me to have a partner, but I would like you to endure. I will talk to Catherine later.

ID=210019006
In any case, order the strategy content as commanded.\nGo to the coastal road and annihilate the soul junk there.

ID=610019001
If this strategy is successful, Kandusity may be hopeful.\nI'm counting on you.

ID=310019001
Go to the coastal road and annihilate Seoul Junk.

ID=510019001
... Honestly, when I received a report from Benjamin I was skeptical.\nThere is no such thing.

ID=510019002
Is it annihilating soul junk alone?\nFumu, the hardships I have ever seemed stupid.

ID=410019001
dont 'worry. This is not a cynic but a fact.\nEven so, I still can not believe it .... Say thanks.

ID=210019501
Now I can officially request the grace city to supply goods.\nWell, what is wrong ... your duty has gone. Ha ha ha.

ID=210019502
Then, how about coming to Victor as a break?\nPlease come and visit when you head for the coastal road.

ID=210019503
It seemed like I was in a hurry. When I said that I did not have it, I went straight back.\nThere should not be an urgent task now, but if you are concerned, you should try going.

ID=610019501
Well then.

ID=310019501
Try to see Victor. It seems that I was looking for you.

ID=100195101
Oh, you got it back. You seem to have been a big success?\nIt is truly a hero of Loco Town. I was moved by honesty. Haha.

ID=100195102
Oh, there was no special purpose.\nHowever, if there is an "individual" on the coastal road, think that I want you to catch alive.

ID=100195103
Seoul Junk's alive capture is like talking about the clouds.\nIn order to do that, we need a material that can trap you guys.\nBut, as you know, the mucilage of the guy fuse with surrounding things.

ID=100195104
If I think so, I was giving up because I was forced to do so.\nmy mother. But I am glad that you care.

ID=100195105
Huh? What is that individual?\nWell ... that can not be said from my mouth. Because the confederation is confidential.

ID=100195106
It is not a formal coalition member From me I can not say any more.\nBut if you dare say, only the code name "Queen" ....

ID=100195107
Then, this is more confidential information,\nBlock has a very strong mouth. my mother.

ID=100195201
Hmm? Codename "Queen"?

ID=100195202
......

ID=100195203
... you, that information from where ...!\nNo, I have nothing to ask.

ID=100195204
Jukuta's guy ...! What are you thinking ...!

ID=100195205
... Do not tell me that I talked, are not you?

ID=100195206
When I first saw you, I talked about why I was stationed here ... Do you remember?\nThe reason is that the code name "Queen".

ID=100195207
Soul junk is basically generated only inside the blank.\nBut now, whitespace has entered a dormant period, the number of soul junk is continuing to increase.

ID=100195208
In other words, it is not empty that somewhere they are built.\nAnd that root source is Kandas City here.

ID=100195209
Maybe some special individuals are making them.\nThis is just a guess.

ID=100195210
It is something like a phantom creature. Without someone who looked directly, even existence is not certain.\nI am here to find out such a person.

ID=100195211
You can get sick a little, do not you? But, if this hypothesis is true, it is considerably dangerous.\nIn fact, it is true that Seoul Junk appears from Kandusity.

ID=100195212
Well, that sort of thing.\nI think I know that ... It is absolutely a secret of "Queen".

ID=100195213
This is the situation ....\nWhat influence will be around ... You know even if you do not say?

ID=100195214
Ha, I'm tired after talking too much. Any questions? Probably not?\nWell, go to Colonel Aaron. There may be something.

ID=510019501
It was just right. I was almost about to call you.

ID=410019501
... There was a news that the refueling vehicle that was headed for me was attacked.

ID=210020001
I asked Grace City for supplementation as you cleaned Seoul Junk on the coastal road.\nIt was always possible because the opportunity was being heard, but it was possible ....

ID=210020002
Seoul Junk, which was thought to have been destroyed, appeared again and seemed to have attacked the refueling vehicle.\nThe passengers barely escaped to Grace City.

ID=210020003
As long as I hear the report, there are too many numbers as a remnant of Seoul Junk ....\nIt is said that it is larger than the number you swept away.

ID=210020004
Even more problematic is that they are floating one after the other.\nMoreover, the existence of the codename "asphalt golem" was confirmed.

ID=210020005
Asphalt golem? Formerly, one who destroyed one company ...?\ngreat! There is no shortage for the opponent!

ID=210020006
... It will be a total power battle,\nThere is no chance of winning at this rate.

ID=210020007
Do not worry!\nIf there are me and%username%, there is no scary thing!

ID=210020008
... This is the first step.\nLet 's block the tunnel on the coastal road.

ID=210020009
... Huh? Wait a minute.\nDad, are you serious?

ID=210020010
If you collapse the tunnel, there will be only one way to go to Locotown.\nIn other words, their intrusion will be gone.

ID=210020011
No ... Uh, that's not the case ...!

ID=210020012
... Of course, we can not expect to get out and get supplement.

ID=210020013
However, it will be managed.\nRight now ... do our utmost to overcome this crisis.

ID=610020001
Collapse the tunnel on the coastal road to prevent entry,\nIt annihilates the codename "asphalt golem".

ID=610020002
That's useless! With supplies this time ....\nBurning Red MK II Clear version comes ...!

ID=610020003
......\nHurry up.

ID=610020004
Mum ... I have been ignored for a long time.\nDad, do you know? The first cause of domestic discord is lack of conversation between families.

ID=610020005
To listen unconditionally to excessive demands of children is also the cause of family discord, Catherine.

ID=610020006
Not at all! You can see it when you see Dad!\nThe moment I saw Burning Red MK II, this is the best made by mankind ...!

ID=610020007
%username%.\nI'm leaving early.

ID=610020008
So, do not ignore me!

ID=100200101
... I can not withdraw as it is.\nThis plan, I will go with you!

ID=100200102
Ba, Burning Red does not matter!\nHave you heard it yet? Why am I here and why is Dad like that?

ID=100200103
Ability is totally ... I am a different person.\nOnly the feelings of thinking about this world will not be beaten to anyone!

ID=100200104
I do not want to see the appearance of my dad that is troubled by me anymore ....\nI want to prove that this time, she is a daughter who is a foreign strength person!

ID=100200105
Come on! let's go!\nThe coastal road is calling!

ID=100200201
Fuu ... You've arrived safely.

ID=510020001
We only blow up the tunnel and prevent entry!

ID=410020001
Huh huh ... It is also a matter of time that Katharine's ability to become known to the world!

ID=210020501
But, in fact, there is a serious problem.\nUm, I ... claustrophobia, I am not good at tunnels ....

ID=210020502
Besides, my stomach hurts even before leaving ... there is a possibility that a migraine with a chronic disease may develop.\nOh no! It is not that I'm afraid of being afraid! What? Ha, ha ha ha!

ID=210020503
What is that eyes? Do you doubt it?\nShame as a member of the coalition that you doubt your friends ...!

ID=210020504
......

ID=210020505
... I'm sorry. I am really scared and my feet are trembling.\nEven just by coming so far, life has shrunk for 10 years ....

ID=210020506
... I'm really sorry, I will retire here.\nWell, I am not useful at all. Hahaha ....

ID=210020507
Oh, I misunderstood.\nAnd, anyway!

ID=210020508
To Hehehe. To Hehehe.\nDoes not it manage somehow?

ID=610020501
... Here, I will never forget this kindness!

ID=310020501
Fa, fight!\nHahaha ... Hahaha ... hahahahaha ....

ID=510020501
It was a pain.\nIt is regrettable that the approach route has gone out ... There must be another way.

ID=510020502
Even so, that is to end the work soon ....\nIt is a bit of a troubling opponent as a commander. Ha ha ha.

ID=510020503
I will contact you again if something happens. Please stay rest till then.\nOops it looks like. I have a favor to ask.

ID=410020501
Will you call Katherine, who went to the scene together?

ID=210021001
......

ID=210021002
......

ID=210021003
......\n......

ID=210021004
......

ID=210021005
............\n............

ID=210021006
......\n... Umm ... but, there is something talking about ...?

ID=210021007
No, is not it?\nRather Catherine. Do not you have something to tell me?

ID=210021008
AE? Is not it?\nWow, why are we?

ID=210021009
Hmm ... I was in trouble.\nCatherine, make sure you are next to Victor from now.

ID=210021010
Victor, Mr. Victor! What? Why ... suddenly! What?

ID=210021011
%username%.\nTell Victor to report Catherine's behavior from now on to me.

ID=210021012
Wait a moment ...!\nI mean to watch over me! What?

ID=210021013
That's it.

ID=210021014
Horrible! What did I do!\nTo treat such a daughter to such a terrible thing ...!

ID=210021015
Because it is a real daughter.\nNo more ... I do not want to see you cause problems.

ID=210021016
problem! What? I just ... I want everyone's help ...!

ID=210021017
People have a given role!\nIt is arrogant to escape from that role until you put your life on!

ID=210021018
......! !

ID=210021019
... I know how you were with your feelings.\nBut you are a very ordinary girl.

ID=210021020
That's ... it's time to tell the situation.

ID=210021021
......

ID=210021022
... I understand. I am next to Mr. Victor.\nIn the future I will take actions that fit my physical condition. Sorry until now.

ID=210021023
In the end only one word.\nDaddy ... That mustache does not suit you so please shave it soon.

ID=210021024
! !

ID=210021025
... Well then.

ID=210021026
... I have a hard time.\nBut I believe this is for that girl.

ID=210021027
You explain the situation to Victor and tell him what you said earlier.\nYou should also overlook trivial things.

ID=610021001
Well ... I should rest a bit.

ID=610021002
By the way ... does my mustache suit me so much?

ID=310021001
Will not you check if Catherine is next to JVC?

ID=100210101
I see, such a thing ....\nOK, leave Catherine to me!

ID=100210102
... It is Hun.

ID=100210103
Katherine, do not be so bad.\nAaron is also thinking of you.

ID=100210104
Are you going to be comforting?

ID=100210105
......

ID=100210106
It's OK. I will make it as desired by Dad.\nI am quiet with my position as an adult. Like Kakashi!

ID=100210107
Therefore, please do not talk to such a Kakashi like this anymore.\nFunk!

ID=100210108
Fuu, what a pity.\nWell, it will be quiet soon. I am still a child.

ID=100210109
Who is a child!

ID=100210110
that? Did not you tell me not to talk?

ID=100210111
Ah ... Uoohoo! Also !

ID=100210112
my mother. You do not have to worry about these things.\nWhy do not you go to the block?\nI was looking for a red face and looking for you.

ID=100210113
Well ... did you do anything?

ID=510021001
slow. What were you googling about?

ID=410021001
There is a person who wants to see you.\nTotally, why did I crawl like this ...?

ID=210021501
You see a guy like a pig over there, do not you?\nHenry, head of the western branch of Ned Company.

ID=210021502
It seems that he seems to see you, though he is the worst guy as he looks.\nWhat is it for? I do not know such a thing and I do not want to know.

ID=210021503
I think that I know, but the guys in Ned are abnormal.\nThose who would do whatever they want, for money.

ID=210021504
I do not want to speak because I do not accept it physiologically.\nI do not want to suck the same air, but I can not do anything.

ID=210021505
Because of the financial strength Ned stacked up.\nYou probably have a force equal to or greater than that of the coalition.

ID=210021506
This Candas City is also a city built because of the absolute support of Ned.\nThat's enough financial strength to make one or two cities easily.

ID=210021507
In certain respects it is worse than the empty religious faith.\nIt is more realistic and more frightening to manipulate people by money than manipulating people with illusions.

ID=210021508
Anyway, keep this in mind.\nWell, but just in case, I will go with you.\nHenry 's guy, I do not know what to say.

ID=610021501
Then let's ask what pigs to say.

ID=310021501
Let's go to Henry's place. I have to ask him what to say.

ID=100215101
I brought you who I wanted.

ID=100215102
slow! Are you timeless? I do not think that it will take so much time for such a thing.\nI'd like you to do as much work as you can, in proportion to being paid while playing.

ID=100215103
Suddenly what! What? I am not your mate!\nOh no. I do not feel like talking to you and Gudaguda, so just tell me the matter as soon as possible.

ID=100215104
... Why are you still here?\nI told you to come call me certainly, but have not you said that you are coming with us?

ID=100215105
Parents, parents!\nYou can not let him go alone to a toddler who looks like an ant.

ID=100215106
Hun. Have it your way.\nWell, in this situation you do not need to introduce yourself.

ID=100215107
Hey, do you remember me?\nI met him when I was against the Big Puppet at Loco Town.

ID=100215108
Do not you remember? At that time, this is me who ordered the drop of the protective wall.\nWell, whatever the reason, it is no exaggeration to say that it is a benefactor who made you a hero as a result.

ID=100215109
There are plenty to do.\nI wonder if you abandoned shame as a human being?

ID=100215110
Shut up. I am not talking to you now.\nActually, there is something I want you to ask me.

ID=100215111
Investigate the underground canal in Kandus city.\nI do not know what happened, but I have not been able to supply water a while ago.

ID=100215112
The drinking water is on the bottom.\nGo to the underground waterway and investigate the cause of the problem.

ID=100215113
You know, we are not your men!\nI am talking about arbitrary things! What?

ID=100215114
Costume Play. Do not like it if you do not like it.\nWe only have to block the underground waterway and pull it off here.

ID=100215115
......

ID=100215116
Although I am drinking water thanks to Ned Company,\nI do not think you can do anything of this degree.

ID=100215117
I know what you want to say.\nBut, I can not go to such a dangerous place without any information.

ID=100215118
A dangerous place? Underground waterway?\nWhat I do not understand.

ID=100215119
A sweet pig. Is there a possibility that Soul junk or Vesi is the cause?\nCan you take responsibility if something happens?

ID=100215120
... Let's say that it was caused by Soul junk or Vesi as you said. So what is it?\nDo you need drinking water etc?

ID=100215121
......

ID=100215122
Whether or not to go is your freedom.\nWell, at best you make a smart choice.

ID=100215123
%username%. Let's go.\nI have to report to Colonel Aaron.

ID=510021501
You asked Henry to investigate the underground waterway?

ID=410021501
Hmm ... certainly water supply related problems are occurring here and there.

ID=210022001
Recently, the whole of Kandusity concerning water supply\nIt seems that complaints are increasing rapidly. Even if water comes out, it will be stinky.

ID=210022002
The underground waterway is the possession of Ned. I asked Henry several times for permission to enter ....\nEvery time it was turned down for various reasons.

ID=210022003
I had no choice but to watch the situation.\nYou do not have to ask a customer from over there.

ID=210022004
Colonel. This ... is not that suspicious?

ID=210022005
That's right. However, we can not keep the water supply problem forever.\nIs there a possibility that Seoul Junk lives in the block, underground waterway?

ID=210022006
It is extremely expensive. Since it has been a long time since the problem occurred,\nIt is not surprising that a unique ecosystem has been created.\nIt will insist that Henry is different ....

ID=210022007
There is no choice but to do. %username%.\nGet ready for battle and enter the underground waterway.

ID=210022008
Are you going to make a fortune?

ID=210022009
Do not do that. If water supply is impossible, you must find out the cause and solve it.

ID=210022010
Well ... That's right. Besides that there is no way.\nThen I will tell Henry to enter.

ID=210022011
Because it is a groundwater path owned by Ned, I think that we do not know what is the problem even if we see it.\nSo, I will bring you along with witness and technical support.

ID=610022001
I order the underground waterway investigation from this.\nThere is a high possibility that battle will occur. Please be careful.

ID=310022001
Go ahead to the underground waterway and proceed with the investigation.\nThere is a high possibility that battle will occur. To be careful.

ID=510022001
Damn it! I do not think that it will take care so far ....\nThis is the face that matches Rawen-sama ....

ID=510022002
Hey you! I hid something ...?\nPlease speak frankly if you do not want to be told by your boss like Rogen.

ID=410022001
Uuu ... ceaselessly.\nI will explain the situation.

ID=210022501
There was a study that the Ned Company had done secretly.\nIt is a study of "Vacuum Vane" which is a substance constituting soul junk.

ID=210022502
Vacuum Bain is effectively close to a universal substance.\nIt can fuse anything, because it can grow if there are any.

ID=210022503
Use this well and explore possibilities for diversion to treatment and body strengthening.\nThis is the starting point of research. And the research has achieved some results.

ID=210022504
Do you know that vacuum vane can not penetrate humans?\nSeoul Energy and Vacuum Vane, which everyone has, can not be fused because of conflict.

ID=210022505
But the research subject is human.\nTherefore, we began to improve the Vacuum Bain.

ID=210022506
Vacuum Bain that fuses with humans ... does it mean?

ID=210022507
That's it. But ... the experiment is a big failure.\nVacuum Bain was not of a nature that we could control.

ID=210022508
After all, what we have left is only a large amount of vacuum vane and failed research data.\nIn the course of processing this waste, it is presumed that it flowed into the underground waterway.

ID=210022509
Would you like to say that rattles and others inside the underground channel became soul junk?

ID=210022510
That's it.

ID=210022511
Well, something stinky.\nYou are still hiding something, do not you?

ID=210022512
I do not care what you think.\nAnyway, this is what happened with our mistake. We will set aside.

ID=210022513
The underground waterway is closed, and water problems are solved by mobilizing by transport machines or helicopters.\nThis problem is over with this.

ID=210022514
Well ... OK. There is nothing wrong if it says going there.\nWell then, let's go. %username%.

ID=210022515
(Let's go back with the block)

ID=210022516
......

ID=210022517
(The block which I was walking stopped suddenly)

ID=210022518
%username%. Now go to the underground waterway.

ID=210022519
It is doubtful. Surely there is something behind.\nNed 's mercenary said a while ago ....

ID=210022520
It seems that mercenaries and researchers were dispatched secretly to the underground waterway,\nIt seems I do not know where I am.

ID=210022521
The situation is serious. That attitude that is not like Henry is the best proof.\nGo to the underground canal soon. I will tell Lt. Col. Quickly!

ID=610022501
First, we sent a researcher and a mercenary ... Contact with them.\nIf my expectation is correct ... it may not be human anymore ....

ID=310022501
What, what is!\nI am busy, get it off quickly.

ID=100225101
Yup? Why are you here?

ID=510022501
You also came to find something in the underground waterway?

ID=410022501
Oh, it was just right.\nActually, I have a little problem.

ID=210023001
Henry gave me orders in a panic.\nImmediately pick up some things in the underground canal.

ID=210023002
So, some researchers including me came to this underground canal.\nI am just an escort. Recovery work is the job of the researcher.

ID=210023003
I did not think deeply, but suddenly I fought with soul junks.\nAt that time he was stranded with the researcher. I suppose I should be somewhere in the future ....

ID=210023004
Well I am just an ordinary mercenary. As expected, the future is dangerous.\nThere it is. I want to leave it to you ahead. no good?

ID=610023001
Just bringing the researcher is enough.\nBecause the situation is a situation, it is impossible to do anything here any further.

ID=310023001
Soul junk in the underground waterway ... this city is over.

ID=510023501
... Let me sort out a little.

ID=510023502
Human - based soul junk ....\nSoul junk based on soul workers ....

ID=410023501
What on earth have you done ... Ned Company is ....

ID=210024001
Let's report this matter to our headquarters.\nThen explain to Ned Company ....

ID=210024002
I am the opposite. It only gives time to hide in the Ned Company.\nIn the meantime, let us assure evidence and drive them out.

ID=210024003
Block, I agree with what you say ....\nWhat are you going to do with proof?

ID=210024004
Seoul workers who became Seoul Junk a while ago.\nWith all his samples, things will proceed easily.

ID=210024005
Although it seemed to have escaped ... Can it be caught?

ID=210024006
Soul junk basically absorbs surrounding objects.\nAnd, the subject of absorption should have priority over information that has information similar to yourself.

ID=210024007
...%username%, you will be decoyed by you.

ID=210024008
block! What are you talking about!

ID=210024009
It is a guy who became Seoul Junk based on soul worker.\nIf there are soul workers close to you, you will try to predict anything.

ID=210024010
......

ID=210024011
Now is the only way to get rid of him! The situation will fight on time.\nEven while doing this, the Ned 's guys should be proceeding with concealment work.

ID=210024012
... You can not change your belly on your back.\nCan you ask for%username%?

ID=610024001
Do not forget to secure samples.\nAnd ... he is no longer human. Do not hesitate ....

ID=610024002
If you give a little pity ....\nYou will become Soul Junk too. Keep it in mind.

ID=510024001
It's safe and top notch.

ID=410024001
It seems that you got samples.

ID=210024501
Give the sample you got to Victor.\nIt would be difficult to grasp accurately with the current facility, but he would do it.

ID=210024502
Oh ... you are highly appreciated him?

ID=210024503
Really? Block, I thought you were more appreciated?

ID=210024504
Well ... it's limited to soul junk ....\nOh, now it is not the time to do this.\nLet's get to Victor quickly.

ID=610024501
I'm sure you will be delighted when you bring this.\nBecause he is abnormal in love for Seoul Junk.

ID=310024501
Go to Victor and ask for analysis of the sample.

ID=100245101
Hey, I was waiting.\nIt is an old-fashioned facility with no special features, but the preparation is perfection.

ID=100245102
Well, can you get a sample?\nSince analysis takes time, wait a while.

ID=100245103
As expected. It is certain that he loves Seoul Junk ....

ID=100245104
Ah! To Mr. Block! What happened?

ID=100245105
Catharine, Catherine! Oh, ah ... a little. Hahaha.

ID=100245106
Mr. Block ... I am upsetting. Is there any secret?\nWhat is it? Hey, please tell me. Hey.

ID=100245107
Well ... that's an important story. That ... what to say ....\nThat's right! Military secret military secret! Yup.

ID=100245108
Huh? Is it a military secret! What?\nWhat is it! I also see!

ID=100245109
(Masui ...) Da, no! Only soldiers can know military secrets!\nWhen Catherine becomes a soldier, that ... I will show it at that time! Is not it?

ID=100245110
Mr. Victor is not a soldier, is it?

ID=100245111
......

ID=100245112
You show me, are not you?

ID=100245113
Do not do that.

ID=100245114
Show me? (Nicoti)

ID=100245115
Victor, Victor! It still takes! What?

ID=100245116
It is over.\nI was watching the block entwined with Katherine.

ID=100245117
A, you ...!

ID=100245118
Oops, will not you get angry later, will you?\nA slight serious analysis result comes out ....

ID=100245119
......

ID=100245120
As a result of analyzing the sample ... 90% or more was the same as the existing vacuum vane.\nBut ... the remaining 10% had mixed ridiculous things.

ID=100245121
... Anti Seoul.

ID=100245122
Like ...! !

ID=100245123
Anti-soul? What is it?

ID=100245124
Once in a while, there were much different people and soul workers than now. But the crime by them often occurred.\nAt that time there was no coalition, there was nothing to stop.

ID=100245125
They have hands and feet in front of them with transcendental power, when the world got messed up,\nDr. Hicks' hand produced a substance called "anti-soul".

ID=100245126
If this is injected into the body of a different person or a soul worker,\nSeoul Energy which is the source of their power temporarily becomes 0.\nIn other words, you can not use different ability.

ID=100245127
In short, it is a material made for experts and soul worker control.\nAfter the formation of the association, I heard that production was prohibited ....

ID=100245128
That this was discovered from the Jung Knight sample ....\nYou know what it means?

ID=100245129
... Yes, of course.\nLet's go,%username%. In the place of Henry.

ID=100245130
To Henry?\nI see. Are you going to hit it?

ID=100245131
Depending on the situation.

ID=100245201
What are you guys.\nI already told you ....

ID=100245202
A little!\nWhat did you do! What?

ID=100245203
What is it?\nIs this woman sudden?

ID=100245204
It's about anti-soul!

ID=100245205
......!

ID=100245206
Have you mixed Anti Seoul with Vacuum Bain?\nBecause it can not erode because of human soul energy,\nYou controlled Seoul Energy by mixing Anti Seoul, do not you?

ID=100245207
......

ID=100245208
It is a planet? Using the results of experiments done by you,\nCreate soul junk to prey soul workers!\nSo you got a lot of reward money from Rogen?

ID=100245209
......

ID=100245210
Say something! Do you know what they did?\nI just evolved those uncontrollable even those just!

ID=100245211
... There is nothing to talk about.

ID=100245212
Huh? You never speak! What?\nI say nobody talks to the dead, so why do not you tie it once?

ID=100245213
......

ID=100245214
Are you still there?\nWhat is the Vacuum Bain mixed with anti-soul?

ID=100245215
... Do we need to teach it?

ID=100245216
Damn! Here, Konari ...!\n... Right on. We find out.

ID=100245217
Well, let's go! It's no use trying to talk with such a guy. ... Pe! !

ID=100245218
......

ID=510024501
Hey. A bit better?

ID=410024501
I heard a story next to you, but it looks pretty serious.

ID=210025001
I do not really understand what you are talking about,\nIn short it is going to find something Ned hid?

ID=210025002
Then I will tell you something good.\nA while ago, there is a case that Ned's transport plane crashed.

ID=210025003
Transportation machine crashed? What is the relationship with that?

ID=210025004
Listen to the story until the end. Ned was carrying something with a transport plane,\nHe seems to have crashed into a certain unfortunate mansion.\nEven though it was a pretty big accident, nothing was reported.

ID=210025005
There really was not any article. The dead also came out,\nEven though the mansion is a story of a famous business owner ....

ID=210025006
Information operation would have been done at an early stage.\nAlso, the mansion is near here Kandas City.

ID=210025007
I do not know what to investigate, but I do not think this case is unrelated.\nHow is it? Would you like to investigate?

ID=210025008
... It is a very interesting story, why are we talking about this?\nYou are Ned's mercenary, are not you?

ID=210025009
Ned is only using it to live. I do not remember selling it to my heart.\nIf it is only a feeling, it is the coalition side.

ID=210025010
Well then. Are you going to turn around here on this occasion?

ID=210025011
Pension is cheap.

ID=210025012
Well ... well.

ID=210025013
This is about what I can talk about. Do you like to use this information or not?\nDo not blame me after trouble later.

ID=210025014
I understand. Investigate the mansion of%username%.\nI will tell Lt. Col. Quickly!

ID=610025001
Look now ....\nI will hit the definitive evidence in front of me.

ID=310025001
Ned seems to have dropped something on the mansion near Kandusity.\nI do not know well what it is ... something.

ID=510025001
Ned Company's capsule ... inside was packed with vacuum vane.\nThe mansion is overflowing with those who made it soul junk ....

ID=510025002
It will be sufficient as a material to pursue the Ned Company.\nIt was a pain.

ID=510025003
Hmm? What is that ribbon? Why suddenly ribbon etc ....\nDid you discover the ribbon in the house?

ID=510025004
Well people lived there, even though the ribbons are falling down ....\nLet's see which one.

ID=510025005
......

ID=510025006
... This ribbon ... ....\nIt belongs to Katherine.

ID=510025007
no doubt. Before my wife left this world, it is a ribbon gifts for Katherine.\nWhy is this in the residence ...?

ID=410025001
Aaron, Colonel!

ID=410025002
Victor? What is it?

ID=410025003
Catharine, Katherine's ... Catherine's appearance everywhere!

ID=410025004
! !

ID=210025501
... What does it mean?

ID=210025502
... as I said.\nThere is no figure of Katherine anywhere.

ID=210025503
Were not you beside you?\nYou suddenly disappeared?

ID=210025504
In order to investigate a sample of Junk Knight a bit more,\nIn the gap where I went for equipment.

ID=210025505
......\nThen ... this ribbon is still Katherine's ....

ID=210025506
Ribbon! What?\nwhat do you mean?

ID=210025507
I found Katherine's ribbon while searching inside the mansion.\n... In the mansion where Seoul Junk is doing.

ID=210025508
Sounds like that ...! No way!

ID=210025509
It was not decided.\nFirst of all, please listen to Kandal city people where Catherine is going.

ID=610025501
Umm ... My head hurts.

ID=310025501
First of all, ask Kandersity people about Katherine's whereabouts.

ID=100255101
Catherine? Blonde girls?\nOh, I know that girl. Strangely the tension was high.

ID=100255102
Are you an interrogator of a federation?\nIt's amazing though it's still young.

ID=100255103
... I do not feel anything like that ....

ID=100255104
Let's continue listening.

ID=100255105
As the coalition seems to be busy, when you come back from your duty, you are concerned about the duties\nI was listening to various things.

ID=100255106
So, I told you that we could have a fight with Ned.\nI was searching inside the mansion and gathering evidence for Ned's evil.

ID=100255107
... It was done.\nIt is confirmed with this ....

ID=100255108
......

ID=100255109
......

ID=100255110
Your what? What happened? Your face is dark?

ID=100255111
In order for Katherine to look for evidence related to Ned,\nThere must be no doubt that they entered the mansion alone.

ID=100255112
%username%.\nWill you come looking for Catherine?

ID=100255113
This is a personal request.\nIt is not ordered publicly from the coalition, so you do not have to listen.

ID=100255114
Colonel!

ID=100255115
But I want to ask as a father.\nLook up Catherine's whereabouts in the house.

ID=100255116
It is my responsibility ... unless I keep an eye on me, Catherine ...!

ID=100255117
That's it.\nNow concentrate on finding Catherine.

ID=100255118
That's what the block says. And someday it happened someday, on the character of Katherine.\nThere is no need for you to feel responsible.

ID=100255119
Ask, search for Katherine's whereabouts.

ID=510025501
Now officially launch a search strategy now!\nAs Catherine was brought to Seoul Junk, I fought a minute and a second!

ID=410025501
Catherine ... Please be safe.

ID=210026001
Find Henry!\nThat kind of soul junk ... I bet you surely knew something!

ID=610026001
Features, behavior patterns, whatever!\nFind out! hurry up!

ID=100260101
Queen gum?\nIf you think what to say suddenly.

ID=100260102
I do not have time to play!\nEverything is good so get out information about him!

ID=100260103
Suddenly came suddenly I was able to vomit information, what on earth is it all right ....

ID=100260104
(The fist of the block blew fire)

ID=100260105
Grief!

ID=100260106
If you do not want to eat again, whiten quickly!

ID=100260107
Kimi, you, you! I raised my hand for this! What?\nIt's useless at Tada.

ID=100260108
(Block's fist blew fire again)

ID=100260109
Negative! Wait, wait ...! Mi ... to the pedestrian ....

ID=100260110
Let's say it quickly!

ID=100260111
Co, code name "Arachnis" ... Individuals in which humans and spiders are fused,\nMake a nest in a dark place. Uh ....\nBut it is a dark place, I like the place where sunlight enters to a certain extent ... ぐ っ!

ID=100260112
Hunt for a while and stop hunting if you can secure some food.\nIt is characterized by eating and concentrating on spawning preparation.

ID=100260113
Is that all? Other than that?

ID=100260114
Nothing. That's all there is to it.

ID=100260115
heard? Because I search for a place that meets the condition that this guy said in the mansion,\nYou enter the mansion in a hurry! I will fight on time!

ID=100260116
Then a pig! Things that happened due to the lost items of you,\nMixing Anti Seoul with Vacuum Vane, because you pursue at once, it is not escaping!

ID=100260117
I have no time!\nQuickly! Before Katherine is made into food!

ID=510026001
To ... I'm sorry ....\nI ... I came here without permission ....

ID=410026001
But .... Thank you very much.\nHe came to help me ... hi ....

ID=210026501
My body is strange ....\nIt's cold ... It's like being fuzzy ... It seems that something is moving around in the body.

ID=210026502
My body ... have you become strange?

ID=210026503
(It seems the condition is not good, please get back with Catherine in a hurry)

ID=610026501
Uh ... it's cold .... I feel sick ....

ID=310026501
Uh ... it's cold .... I feel sick ....

ID=100265101
... Katherine is resting.\nI was showing symptoms of chills and vomiting ... It seems to have calmed down now.

ID=100265102
... I thank you. Thanks to you I was able to help Katherine.\nWhatever the situation ....

ID=100265103
It seems that Victor has investigated the state of Katherine in detail.\nGo and ask the story.

ID=100265104
... From me ... I can not speak.

ID=100265105
... Fuu, a little ... I want to take a day off.\nSorry, can you leave your seat?

ID=100265201
... Catherine's soul junking is progressing.\nHow to treat ... ... not ....

ID=100265202
When Seoul junking begins ... the last ....\nI can not do anything ....

ID=100265203
We are sorry!\nI ... If I keep an eye on ... this is ....

ID=100265204
I'm really sorry.\nAll ... It is my responsibility.

ID=100265205
......

ID=100265206
Cather, Catherine seems to regain consciousness.\nI'm waiting for you. I want you to go.

ID=510026501
Oh, I was waiting.

ID=410026501
To I am already fine.\nFrom the old days there is only resilience.

ID=210027001
You are not well? No way, I thought that I was going crazy?\nTo Do not worry! I feel very good now!

ID=210027002
I still have a little hula, but I am gradually getting better!\nPerhaps, tomorrow morning is about 100 times catherine energy.

ID=210027003
I felt various things with this thing. Even my own no progress.\nSo do not panic and step on properly and aim for a single person!

ID=210027004
It's useless if I have to take care of you?\nIf it gets dirty it may overtake me ... Gebo! George!

ID=210027005
George! George!\nUh ... well ... oh.

ID=210027006
......

ID=210027007
Oh, that? What is this?\nAh ... I just took a tomato juice a while ago, it is surely .... Ahahahaha.

ID=210027008
Well, it seems I have to take a little rest again.\nI will lie down a bit, so later.

ID=610027001
I was worried ... I can not drink tomato juice already.\nYou seem to have spit up blood? Hahaha ....

ID=310027001
Excuse me. My condition is getting worse now ....\nBecause I take a little rest, can I come back later?

ID=100270101
...... Let's go.

ID=100270102
I will go to Henry.\nYou might know how to solve it.

ID=510027001
Umm ... I still feel a little stomach ....

ID=510027002
Hey, pig.

ID=510027003
... Wh - What is it? Have you come to beat him again?\nDoes the Union Operation Teacher also teach in the melee combat in the basic curriculum?

ID=510027004
... There is a request.

ID=510027005
Hmm? You asked?

ID=510027006
Yes, trust.

ID=410027001
......\nWhy, please say.

ID=210027501
what? What if it's a way to treat soul junk?\nHey, is not it common sense that you can not return to Seoul Junk?

ID=210027502
I know that. However, it was not eroded by ordinary vacuum vane.\nIt was eroded by an improved vacuum vane. You are the sole made by you.

ID=210027503
......

ID=210027504
I will not pursue this.\nHowever, I thought that we had prepared a coping strategy well.

ID=210027505
... Are you trying to trade with me?

ID=210027506
You know the story.\nYes, this is a deal.

ID=210027507
If you offer treatment,\nKeep an eye on everything you did at Kandusity.\nOf course all the materials were destroyed.

ID=210027508
It's not bad deal. You have an antidote.\nBut ... if it is a human being, she loses her life by the side effect of an antidote. Be sure.

ID=210027509
All right. It is a different person to treat.\nIt is not an ordinary human being.

ID=210027510
Different person?\nDid you say that a different person was eroded?

ID=210027511
That's right.

ID=210027512
......\nIs that something like that?

ID=210027513
... Then ... I can do it.\nIf you have the natural resilience of a different person and Seoul Energy ... treatment is possible.

ID=210027514
Ho, really?\nI'm curious that there was a little while.

ID=210027515
I just remembered the previous example. By the way, in the past precedent ....\nAs a result of clinical experiments, I was able to treat with a probability of 100%.

ID=210027516
Clinical trials ...?\n... Anta, we have anti - burning.

ID=210027517
So? Do not you need it?

ID=210027518
No, I will.\nI have no time to say such a thing now, I do not mean to say that.

ID=210027519
OK, let 's allow entrance to the Institute N - 102.\nIt is the place where we were studying soul junk.

ID=210027520
Tell me ... the situation inside the current laboratory is unknown.\nWhat can be said reliably is not the situation where people can live.

ID=210027521
It is a hell picture.\nFailed the experiment, it turned out to be the soul junk's dwelling ... is not it?

ID=210027522
That's right.

ID=210027523
It does not matter.\nHere is what the soul worker is.

ID=210027524
Hmm.

ID=210027525
How can I find an antidote?

ID=210027526
There is no way but to search the inside of the laboratory from one end.\nI will send you the unique identification number of the antidote, so please try to find it.

ID=210027527
Oh, you are kind.

ID=210027528
Also, in accordance with my instructions inside.\nI do not know what to do.

ID=210027529
Please do as you like.

ID=210027530
%username%.\nYou are headed to the Institute now?

ID=610027501
OK, leave it to support.\nAs that pig said, I do not know the situation inside, so be careful.

ID=310027501
... I asked.\nCatherine ... help me.

ID=510027501
%username%!\nVictor! I did not see Victor! What?

ID=410027501
I never saw him ...?\nThat guy ... No way!

ID=210028001
After you went to the laboratory, you suddenly appeared when you thought you were doing something.\nI was wondering if it was a toilet ....

ID=210028002
... I surely knew where the antidote is.\nI guess I went to the laboratory without waiting for you.

ID=210028003
... at all. Catherine's case is not his fault, forever forever ...!

ID=210028004
Anyway, enter the laboratory and take Victor back.\nI do not know what's out! Quickly!

ID=610028001
Be sure to find JVC!

ID=310028001
Oh ... why is it such a thing ...!

ID=510028001
Hey, hey ....

ID=410028001
Ha ... ... It was dangerous.\nFuu ....

ID=210028501
I got an antidote ... I got it.\nIf you have this, you should be able to treat Katherine.

ID=210028502
I am sorry to come here arbitrarily.\nI can not stay even if I stay ....

ID=210028503
But there is something I knew when confined in the cocoon.\nThe detailed story will come back to Kandus city.

ID=610028501
... Let's go.

ID=310028501
Ah, that voice ... I ....

ID=100285101
Fuu ... Finally it is a relief.

ID=100285102
When I was trapped in a cocoon ... I heard a voice.\nIt was a woman's voice, but I do not remember the content well.

ID=100285103
But it was a very clear and sweet voice ....\nI remember that.

ID=100285104
It may be a common phenomenon when people are soul junked.\nIf Katherine is also so, it may be said that soul junking has not progressed so much.

ID=510028501
And ... I got an antidote.\nBut I'm not sure yet.

ID=410028501
You need to give this to Henry and see if it matches.

ID=210029001
Well then let's go meet.

ID=610029001
Let's see if this antidote is genuine.

ID=310029001
... I hope this will fit you ....

ID=100290101
Hmm, it sounds like an antidote.\nI was able to get it well.

ID=100290102
Was good. Well then, turn this into Catherine ....

ID=100290103
wait.\nThat antidote ... independently of what effect it will exert.

ID=100290104
What?

ID=100290105
There is a guy called Beholda in the laboratory.\nIt is an artificial arousal body we created. It is all his fault that the laboratory has been so.

ID=100290106
It will be able to be used for the first time by fusing his DNA and antidote.\nThe reason for troubling this far ... It is for security.

ID=100290107
You mean that you intended not to let others make it?\nIf another person makes an antidote, there is no other choice than fighting the bihold.

ID=100290108
That's such a place. But he left us.\nSo, there is no other way than knocking down to finish the antidote.

ID=100290109
You are treated as a hero there. Finally I need to go to the laboratory.\nAs soon as this happens, you have to blow up and destroy the laboratory.

ID=100290110
Huh? What, what ....

ID=100290111
Dignity Snatcher ... You should have seen a monster that prey on humans in the laboratory.\nDo not let him go outside. Because it is too dangerous, you better destroy the laboratory itself further.

ID=100290112
But I have to get the mystery of the Beholda ....

ID=100290113
So, when you go, you get mucus and the laboratory will blow up.

ID=100290114
I see, it seems to be the only way to do so.

ID=510029001
But it was good.\nI thought that the antidote I had in pain was wasted.

ID=410029001
It was the right answer that I went to take it with a mistake.

ID=210029501
Soon.\nWith Bieholder's mucus, you can treat Katherine.

ID=210029502
Will you go to the laboratory again and get me the mucus?

ID=610029501
Catherine ... Please wait for a while.

ID=310029501
do not forget. It is top priority to get mucus.

ID=510029501
I'll be waiting here.\nFinally ... I can make a complete antidote.

ID=410029501
With this ... I hope that it will get better.

ID=210030001
The material was ready for the time being.\nThe problem is the formula. Do you just mix them or need to process them separately?

ID=210030002
Let's ask Henry.

ID=610030001
Fuu ... why? My heart is throbbing.\nWell then, let's go.

ID=310030001
Let's ask Henry.

ID=100300101
Wow ... you certainly do not really get it?\nI thought that it was not normal, but with this much.

ID=100300102
We also confirmed the explosion of the laboratory. You do it, you.\nThe coalition also captured the good man.

ID=100300103
Just mix mucus and antidote.\nBut do not forget. The effect is within 5 minutes after mixing.

ID=100300104
Is it also a special reason?

ID=100300105
This is also for security. Someone made an antidote in the laboratory\nIt will be troublesome to bring it out.

ID=100300106
... It is here that I can do.\nI have to write a manuscript that blows away the laboratory.

ID=100300107
OK. Thank you for everything.\nOK, let's hurry up to Katherine.

ID=100300201
Wow ... Goho, go!\nFuu, it gets worse and worse ... as it is ....

ID=100300202
Catherine!

ID=100300203
Finished Or, the body has become easier?\nHere, this street ...!

ID=100300204
I brought an antidote!

ID=100300205
Is it an antidote ...?\nI have not got poison! What?

ID=100300206
It does not have to be strengthened! I know the state of Katherine's body well!

ID=100300207
Hun! What are you saying? Do you know well?\nEven though I could not do anything, what is sudden! What?

ID=100300208
... time is regrettable.\nLet's inject an antidote.

ID=100300209
Kaa! I do not! I do not want to!\nIt's the worst to have injections for healthy people!

ID=100300210
Catherine.

ID=100300211
Oh, daddy? When did you come?

ID=100300212
Do as Jictor said.

ID=100300213
... Yes ....

ID=100300214
(Catherine was injected with an antidote)

ID=100300215
Well ... what is this! What? Something comes in like ...!\nI seem to be ... not me!

ID=100300216
... Katherine, be a little patience.

ID=100300217
It is painful.

ID=100300218
(All liquid inside syringe disappeared)

ID=100300219
Fuu ....

ID=100300220
Should the mountain cross this ... ... should I ...?

ID=100300221
Looking at the situation a bit more.\nVictor, you also had a hard time.

ID=100300222
And ... Catherine.\n... Do not worry. All gets better.

ID=100300223
...... Yeah, Dad.

ID=100300224
%username%.\nShall we talk a bit.

ID=510030001
Thank you for listening to my personal request.

ID=410030001
I will never forget this kindness.

ID=210030501
We did our best.\nAfter that, I just watch.

ID=210030502
... I just hope that everything goes well.

ID=210030503
Col., there are reports!

ID=210030504
Hmm? What?

ID=210030505
When I was caught in a cocoon in the laboratory ... I heard a voice.

ID=210030506
voice? What does it mean?

ID=210030507
It is probably a common phenomenon when you make it soul junk.\nAnd ... this phenomenon is also appearing in Katherine.

ID=210030508
A while ago, when asked if Katherine could hear something.\nShe said that he could not hear "any voice."

ID=210030509
I have not heard whether I can hear my voice.\nSurely, there must be a voice still heard now.

ID=210030510
...... what should I do?

ID=210030511
Would you like to go to Rocotown to investigate this phenomenon%username%?\nThere are basic principles that humans do not become Soul junk ....

ID=210030512
There is also the possibility that the improved vacuum vane has flowed into Locotown.\nIf there is a case in which people become Soul junk in Loco Town, that information is necessary.

ID=210030513
I heard that the encounter rate with Seoul Junk is high because there is a space next to it.\nYou might find something clues.

ID=610030501
I do not mind anything. Any information will do.\nCollect as much information as possible.

ID=310030501
Please collect information on Seoul Junk at Locotown.

ID=100305101
Oh, it's been a long time.\nYou seem to be active also in Kandusity.

ID=100305102
Huh ... why? I guess it was very different from imagination?\nIt is not such a place, but another person also calls me ....

ID=100305103
Oh? Are you busy? Yes, sorry.\nIf it looks like it certainly, I do not have time to talk with me.

ID=100305104
Huh ... Just kidding.\nSo, what is urgent?

ID=100305105
Is there a case where a person got into Seoul junk ... Is that it?\nIt is common sense that people do not become Seoul junk.

ID=100305106
Seoul Energy and Vacuum Bain are contradictory properties.\nIt will never merge and the weaker one disappears.

ID=100305107
But I did not bother to come to check that ....\nI wonder what happened?

ID=100305108
......

ID=100305109
... by the way.\nThere is a case that people become Soul junk.

ID=100305110
Because it is a very unusual case and there is no report that it has relapsed,\nIt was irresponsible result that "unpaid" even inside the coalition.

ID=100305111
At the time I was a terminal soldier so I do not know the details.\nBut Mr. Warren knows well.

ID=100305112
People will rely on folk medicine and mythology if unknown circumstances arise.\nOh, I am not saying Mr. Warren badly. He is a real doctor.

ID=100305113
You should ask Mr. Warren.\nYou should know the whole story.

ID=100305201
Oops, who are you thinking? long time no see!\nI was just in trouble, but if it's okay ....

ID=100305202
Hmm? What happened? Are you busy?\nWell that's right. I can read about the air as well.

ID=100305203
So what kind of business do you have for me?\nI will do whatever I can.

ID=100305204
... A case where a man became a soul junk ...?\nYeah, there certainly was. It was a strange ending so I could not make a conclusion.

ID=100305205
There used to be a worker belonging to Ned who used to work in Locotown.\nI lost my family because of the blanks, I lived in drinking every day.

ID=100305206
I had eyes that my soul was missing.\nIt's like a living dead.

ID=100305207
It was a person who only worked idly, but became missing one day.\nOn the day Seoul Junk attacked Rocotown ....

ID=100305208
I thought that they were killed by being killed, but there was no confirmation.\nWhen waiting a few days but he did not return and was forced to put it on the dead list ....

ID=100305209
I came back suddenly.\nHowever, as the situation was strange, I tried a little inspection.\nThen, the soul junk reaction was detected from the body.

ID=100305210
He complained of chills and vomiting symptoms but we did not have the technique to do.\nThere was no precedent. I was only able to watch the condition and take a record.

ID=100305211
By the way, there was something unique.\nVoice ... I was told that the female voice was heard all the time.

ID=100305212
It seems that the voice has grown day by day.\nWe did not catch our voice at the end.\nNo, it would be more accurate to say that I could not hear it.

ID=100305213
However, one day he said that he could not hear his voice.\nThe symptoms of chills and vomiting also stopped, and it improved as a lie.

ID=100305214
However, it turned out to be Seoul Junk in less than a day.

ID=100305215
There was nothing that could be kept as a record.\nThe symptoms of chills and vomiting are common symptoms ... it can also be said that the voice was also a halo.

ID=100305216
Since then the same incident never occurred,\nI could not compare the information.\nIt was a typical irregular one.

ID=100305217
... I asked because I was asked, why?\n... No, the same thing is happening?

ID=100305218
Wait a minute? There is no possibility.\nEven then, everyone was terribly upset.

ID=100305219
Anyway, this is about what I can talk about.\nWas it a little useful?

ID=510030501
It is serious!\nKandas city is tough!

ID=410030501
I will listen to the investigation later!\nNow, Seoul Junk is stunning like a stupid!

ID=210031001
I do not know the reason, but the soul junk whose source is unknown is getting caught!\nThe number can not be measured! It's not big enough to engage!

ID=210031002
Now the residents of the city are preparing to evacuate!\nI got a conclusion that we abandoned Kandas city ....

ID=210031003
I asked Henry for cooperation and decided to rent a transportation machine in shelter,\nThey are also messed up inside the shelter.

ID=210031004
But, if you can not open the ceiling of the shelter the transport machine has not jumped!\nGo straight away, run the switchgear!

ID=610031001
Quickly! I will annihilate it as it is!

ID=310031001
If you do not want to die, start the switchgear!

ID=510031001
I did not have a break as soon as I returned.\nHowever, the ceiling of the shelter opened safely and preparation for evacuation was completed.

ID=510031002
The reason why such a thing happened suddenly is unknown,\nAll we can do is to leave here.

ID=410031001
By the way, did you understand something about the case?

ID=210031501
Did you have a precedent! What?\nThe same symptoms as Katherine ... until a voice?

ID=210031502
It can not be done like this.\nNow go to Victor!

ID=210031503
Colonel! There is a problem with No. 4 shelter!\nOne of the inhabitants who was preparing for escape is rampaging!

ID=210031504
......\nYou talk to Victor about that. I head to the shelter.

ID=610031501
But ... Is there anything we can do ...?

ID=310031501
Tell Victor the story you heard in Loco Town.

ID=100315101
Why, did you have a precedent?\nThat is exactly the same symptoms ....

ID=100315102
This is dangerous even if you think about it.\nIt is necessary to confirm the state of Katherine now.

ID=100315103
It seems that the effect of medicine has not yet come out,\nOn the contrary the condition had deteriorated slightly.

ID=100315104
If Katherine moved it into the transport plane.\nI will soon head to Grace City and will have a detailed exam.

ID=100315105
If you borrow the power of the ST lab, you may find some solutions.\nIt is the highest biological laboratory in existence.

ID=100315106
... If it's impossible for the ST lab, I will make Catherine cold sleep.\nUntil an accurate treatment is found.

ID=100315107
Would you go inside the transport plane and meet Katherine?\nI still need to check if my voice is still heard.

ID=100315108
If you still hear the voice, it may still be in time.

ID=510031501
Coho ... Go Go!\nAh ... ... you came ....

ID=410031501
Haha ... Thank you.

ID=210032001
But what happened?\nSoul junk suddenly ....

ID=210032002
Catherine, can you still hear the voice?

ID=210032003
This voice ...?\nAnd what do you say suddenly ...?

ID=210032004
I do not have time!\nDo you hear the voice! What?

ID=210032005
......

ID=210032006
I still hear it.\nAlways since I was at home ....

ID=210032007
... Was good.\nI want you to listen carefully. Catherine.

ID=210032008
If you can not hear the voice please be sure to tell me.

ID=210032009
Huh? Did you understand something?\nWell, will it get better if the voice stops being heard?

ID=210032010
...... Yup.\nIf you can not hear your voice, it means complete recovery.

ID=210032011
It was good.\nActually my voice has gradually become smaller.

ID=210032012
...... Was good.\nI am getting better ... It is getting better.

ID=210032013
It was really good.\nHaha ... After all it was the effect of the medicine that Mr. Victor brought me.

ID=210032014
Haha ... that's right.\nIf you believe me ... everything will work out if you trust me.

ID=210032015
Only me ... Believe me.

ID=210032016
Hehe, it is reassuring!

ID=210032017
Well, have a little rest here.\nI will bring Colonel Aaron right away.

ID=210032018
Yes, this time I am waiting quietly!\nGohogo!

ID=210032019
... ... Please be patient with me.

ID=210032020
%username%.\nLet's go to Colonel Aaron.

ID=610032001
I have no time.\nI have to go to Grace City as soon as possible to find a way ....

ID=100320101
I see ... my voice is getting smaller and smaller ... / /.

ID=510032001
As soon as I could not hear the voice, I was told that I would soon be junk.\nThen, you can not spend any more time.

ID=410032001
I need to head to Grace City right now.

ID=210032501
I will head to Catherine.\nYou guys will join after confirming evacuation of evacuees.

ID=210032502
It is dangerous! I do not know where Seoul Junk comes from ....

ID=210032503
I am sorry for my personal reasons. That girl ... It is my irreplaceable girl.

ID=210032504
... I understand.

ID=210032505
Then, I will go ahead.

ID=610032501
... that's strange.\nSeoul Junk seems to be aiming for Katherine ... ....

ID=610032502
feed ....

ID=610032503
... eh?

ID=610032504
Because it is Seoul Junk based on a different person.\nThere is no more bait. From the point of soul junk ...

ID=610032505
... We will also hurry.

ID=100325101
Well ... sorry.\nYou seem to be impatient.

ID=100325102
Catharine is ahead of us.\nI'm sorry, will you bring me in, too?

ID=100325103
The transport departs when we board.\nLet's hurry.

ID=510032501
Catherine, where is Catherine?

ID=410032501
Where did you go? Catherine ...!

ID=210033001
... It is contact from Victor.\nCatherine is traveling to the second passenger's room.

ID=210033002
It seems that Victor did it well. That place leads to the top roof of the transport aircraft.\nEven if it is soul junk it should not be easily invaded.

ID=210033003
However, I can not rest assured. Seems to be full of soul junk inside the transport plane.\nDefeat them and join with Katherine.

ID=610033001
Still ... there is hope.\nIf you arrive at Grace City ... the way ....

ID=310033001
Do not like them.\nPlease help Katherine.

ID=510033001
Wow ...! When you become a pinch you surely come.

ID=410033001
You feel fatey, are not you? Effee ....

ID=210033501
Always ... I'm just trying to get help.\nSo I decided.

ID=210033502
I will target you!\nI have not done it yet, I will definitely keep up with you!

ID=210033503
But please do not go too far.\nIt will not be able to go on. To Daejeon.

ID=210033504
Papa was saying. People decide everything by how to hold their minds.\nKana, I can not hear your voice! Body is also easy!

ID=210033505
Is not it okay? You got better?\nAfter all the power of the heart is amazing!

ID=210033506
Hehe ...\nSo, thank you from now on!

ID=510033501
Catherine ... Catherine ...!

ID=410033501
Woo, woooo ah ah ...! !\nCatherine! !

ID=210034001
Why ... why is this ...!\nWhy is it!

ID=210034002
Catherine ... what did you do ...!\nWhy ... why ...!

ID=210034003
... Henry ...! !\nSearch Henry!

ID=610034001
I am a fake antidote ...!\nWe ... cheated me ... Katherine!

ID=610034002
Looking for Henry ...!\nI will explain what I mean!

ID=310034001
Looking for Henry ...!\nI will explain what I mean!

ID=100340101
Henry? Oh, he seems to have gone on a special plane somewhere.\nYou seemed to be in a hurry.

ID=100340102
Have a lot of things like files ....\nOh, "I succeeded in the end, I was crying that promotion would be correct!

ID=100340103
......\nReally.

ID=100340104
You looked pretty happy.\nAbout to be glad until I see it. my mother.

ID=100340105
Also, my soul junk was so beautiful.\nYou guys did it, do not you? I understand. Thank you.

ID=100340106
......

ID=510034001
Is that something like that ...?\nWe ... were they being danced on Henry's hand?

ID=410034001
... Catherine ....

ID=210034501
... well done.\nThanks to you I managed to solve a lot of things.

ID=210034502
I ... I'm fine.\nThere is no need to worry.

ID=210034503
Just ... as a father ....\nIt is a pity that I could not do anything at the end.

ID=210034504
I am more anxious ... you are worried.

ID=210034505
I ... stay here, I will never repeat such a thing again ....\nI am planning to eradicate soul junk.

ID=210034506
You ... go to Grace City and follow Henry's whereabouts.

ID=210034507
It is necessary for him to take responsibility.\nIt can not be overlooked as it is.

ID=210034508
I'm begging you.\nGo to Grace City and ask Toll for cooperation.

ID=210034509
Then ... Will you meet Block and Victor before you leave?\nIt would be better to do the last greeting.

ID=210034510
... During this period, it really was a hard time.

ID=100345101
Catherine ....

ID=100345102
It was a really healthy child. It's hard to be a partner.\nI will postpone himself and always be bright ... I can never crush.

ID=100345103
It was completely different from me.\nTo be honest, I did not know how to contact her.

ID=100345104
You avoided it ....

ID=100345105
When I looked at Katherine, myself who desperately lived until now ... seemed very miserable.\nIt's like having lived a wrong life.

ID=100345106
But, I feel like I can understand now.\nThanks to that girl ... I wonder how much I have been saved.

ID=100345107
Catherine ... you want to be like me ....\nI do not want to be a cool person ... ...

ID=100345108
That word ... gave me further growth.\nThat you are so bright that you can not betray the expectations of a pure child.

ID=100345109
But ... already ....\nSo far ....

ID=100345110
Catherine has gone ... ....

ID=100345111
......

ID=100345112
sorry .... I want to be a little alone.

ID=100345113
......

ID=100345201
All ... It's because of me.\nAll I was wrong.

ID=100345202
If I had to leave my side at that time ....\nAt that time ... I have to inject medicines ...!

ID=100345203
To such a thing ... I did not!\nIt's my fault ... mine!

ID=100345204
Besides that laughter as well as energetic footsteps ....\nThere are also little hands that hit my shoulder sunken ... There is not anymore.

ID=100345205
I want you to believe ...!\nOnly me ... I should believe ...! I promised ....

ID=100345206
......

ID=100345207
... I heard that I am going to Grace City looking for Henry.

ID=100345208
He's ... ....\nDo not forgive Henry.

ID=100345209
Please. Henry alone is absolutely ....\nHenry ... erase me from this world!

ID=100345210
Uoo ... Uu.

ID=100345211
Catherine ....\nSorry ... Wow ....

ID=100345212


ID=100345213
Wow! Is it a soul worker you used to do in Loco Town?\nWow ~! I am the first real soul worker!

ID=100345214
Even if you look like this is actually a different person!\nIt's still weak and useless, but it will surely be the Union's Ace!

ID=100345215
Wow! Will you also save me from the crisis?\nWe are surely destiny! Jeje.

ID=100345216
I have always been saved ....\nSo I decided.

ID=100345217
I will target you!\nIt is not long yet, but I can surely keep up with you!

ID=100345218
But please do not go too far?\nI will not be able to go there. To Daejeon.

ID=100345219
I'm sorry ....\nAnd thank you. For me ... crying.

ID=100345220
"Chapter 2: The Mourning Sky"\nThe end

ID=510034501
Are you a soul worker whose commander was Lt. Colonel Aaron?

ID=410034501
You came a lot.\nThe city of grace is here.

ID=260029501
I am glad to see you. I am a lion television cameraman "Hugh".

ID=260029502
Hmm? Why did you come to such a dangerous place?\nIs not that decided?

ID=260029503
In such a time, this is the battlefield,\nBecause there should be broadcasting stations that convey reality and facts to the general public.

ID=260029504
Well, to be accurate I mean you came to "interview".

ID=260029505
Anyway, is it a "hero" that you prevented Vesi's attack at Loco Town?

ID=260029506
As expected after all. You had a big fuss about your topic over there.

ID=260029507
Although it is my first time meeting, it is bad, can you ask me a favor?

ID=260029508
It is related to this interview, but the reporter is a bit nervous ....\nOops, the introduction was delayed. "Cynthia" of a reporter who works together.

ID=260029509
Hun, who are you working together?\nI am my job, you just do your job, do not you?

ID=260029510
... Well, as you can see it is a bit grumpy,\nIt is not bad to go out with a drink. It is beautiful above all.

ID=260029511
Anyway. Actually, I met a crewmembers beforehand in the preliminary survey,\nAt that time, a monster like a mole came out and was disturbed.

ID=260029512
Fortunately, thanks to the crew members, the monster ran away.\nCynthia was OK at that time.

ID=260029513
But, returning to the inn, what is the monster just before, why did not you prevent it in advance\nJaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ... ....

ID=260029514
A little! How long are you going to wait! What?

ID=260029515
understood .... Anyhow, it can not be disturbed again,\nCan you defeat that monster appearing on the coastal road?

ID=660029501
I am saved. Oh, and also ... Please watch the broadcast that Cynthia covered before it flows.\nWell, the personality is but I do a good job in front of the camera. It's beautiful than anything else.

ID=360029501
There is no time to formal coverage. Please handle as soon as possible.

ID=560029501
Is the monster managed somehow?

ID=460029501
Was saved. Thanks to that, it seems to be able to shoot without being disturbed. Thank you.

ID=460029502
This theme is "Starry Forest Union, who are they?"\nYou are a coalition member, so please leave some time someday. Ha ha!

ID=260030001
There is "material cooperativity" as a characteristic of soul junk.\nIt is to take over the properties of absorbed substances as they are.

ID=260030002
Briefly, if you absorb plants, you will know the characteristics of plants,\nWhen you absorb animals, you have the characteristics of that animal.

ID=260030003
It is said that the constituent substance is just vacuum vacuum, and the property itself is completely the same as the corresponding individual.\nIn other words, it means to take over all the characteristics of the absorbed life form as they are.

ID=260030004
However, in the case of this coastal road it can be said that it is a very unique case.\nSoul junk built by absorbing inanimate objects such as concrete and rock ....

ID=260030005
I am moving with my will, though.\nEven if the base individual is not willing, they seem to have a will.

ID=260030006
Will not you get the core elements that make up the guys?\nYou may find out why substances that do not have will act as if they are willing.

ID=660030001
I want you to get the chunk making up the codename "Wildstone".\nOh, and ... Will you pass the gobs you got to the block?

ID=660030002
I am not yet an official Star Forest Alliance member.\nIt's such a workplace and there are still some restrictions on my behavior.

ID=660030003
In other words, it can not formally conduct activities like research activities and investigative reports.\nI think that it will be gradually resolved over time, but ... I can not let you go without doing anything until then.

ID=660030004
I talked to the block.\nI will bring samples and ask for investigation ... and so on.

ID=660030005
Well, thank you.

ID=360030001
I want you to get the chunk making up the codename "Wildstone".\nI'm waiting.

ID=560030001
I heard the story. Is this a block of that stone?

ID=560030002
At first sight it looks just like a stone, is not it?\nTry to research something ... Ka!

ID=560030003
What, this ...! It's soft!\nDoes that mean mucus like a stone? Wow, I feel bad ...!

ID=560030004
That means ... In the case of Soul Junk who built up the body by absorbing inanimate objects,\nDo you mean to deform the mucus and create a form similar to what you absorbed?

ID=460030001
Ugh ... I do not understand something at all, but I feel bad.\nI will leave this to the laboratory for the time being. Thanks for your hard work.

ID=260030501
Yo, my name is "Ralph."\nIt is a mercenary belonging to Ned.

ID=260030502
Hmm? Mysterious? There is a mercenary in such a time.

ID=260030503
Ned can not make a specialized military group to restrain the coalition.\nSo, I hire mercenaries like me, reinforcing military strength.

ID=260030504
As you may know, Ned's financial strength is the best in the Cloud Dream.\nIn other words, even though it is a mercenary hired by money, that number is not odd.

ID=260030505
Generally speaking, it is said that there are more mercenaries in this place than the coalition.\nThat's about that size.

ID=260030506
Well, people who move with money in this era will not receive a good impression.\nBut money is important. Because it is such a time it is unnecessary. Of course, I also need money.

ID=260030507
However, since interests are formed with money, talks progress with ability and achievement.\nAs soon as you made a mistake a little fungus. There is no re-employment. It is over at the moment of failure.

ID=260030508
So what, can you lend me your power a little?\nI feel like I've seen it, my arms looks good.

ID=260030509
Oh, of course it is not free.\nI will put out a firm part for me.

ID=260030510
I mean to mercenary mercenaries.\nHow is it? Do you feel that?

ID=660030501
No, I do not understand the story.\nThe content is simple. Knock the codename "War Lik".

ID=660030502
Originally, my job was to collect things of the gold eye on the coastal road,\nEvery time I go, he appears and gets in the way.

ID=660030503
Because I was not able to manage anything, I was giving up whenever he appears ....\nAs it is, it will be fired soon.

ID=660030504
If you do not even have a guy you can focus on work ... so please ask.\nI am not asking for my job, is not it still good?

ID=360030501
Defeat the codename "War - like".

ID=560030501
You seem to have done it.\nGood job.

ID=560030502
Well then will you go to work.\nBy the way, why was he so angry?

ID=560030503
Well, it seemed I was chasing me ....\nWell, was that searching for me?

ID=460030501
Well ... I do not mind.

ID=260031001
Once in a while I've heard some interesting rumors.\nIt is a story of a man who passed solemnly where Seoul Junk wanders a lot.

ID=260031002
They are basically hostile to all life forms other than their own,\nIt is a rumor that it is a unique wavelength emitted by the internal nucleus, distinguishing each other ... ....

ID=260031003
A man seems to have gotten into his core and got into their den.\nThe result is ... It came out safely as expected.

ID=260031004
It may be a strange story, but it's an important story for people like me.\nEven though working alone is difficult, I can think of them all.

ID=260031005
Defeat War-like again and bring that nucleus.\nI have to check if rumors are true.

ID=260031006
Let's prepare the best thing among the rewards that I can do.\nYou seem to be quite excellent.

ID=660031001
If the reason why he gets angry is because I am the creature of another species\nDoes anything have to do with acting and making friends.

ID=360031001
Defeat War Lik and get that core.

ID=560031001
Is this? What is his nucleus?\nIt is a very intimidating shape. It is like a jewel and it is also like a heart.

ID=460031001
Alright, you will know if it is effective as you walk around.\nIt was a pain. If something happens I will be okay.

ID=260031501
Hello! What is "hero" in Loco Town are you?

ID=260031502
I am Robert. The former mayor of this city ... No, now is an ordinary man who is useless ... ...

ID=260031503
Fuu ....

ID=260031504
......

ID=260031505
Oh, I'm sorry. ...... Huh? Reason for the sigh?

ID=260031506
Haa ... Actually, it is a while ago,\nI went to Grace City to secure necessary items for the child care facility here.

ID=260031507
On the way home after finishing all the necessary items, suddenly they were hit by a monster ....\nI barely escaped, but I have put food and clothes on the spot ....

ID=260031508
Besides, until the car that is the only article left by my father ....

ID=260031509
I was planning to go looking for it later ....\nA moment ago I looked at the pictures that the Union members had before long ago.

ID=260031510
There was a monster that appeared due to the space called "Recage".\nIt seemed that his body was made of building materials and various kinds of garbage. But ....

ID=260031511
There was also my father 's car in it.\nI gave up everything.

ID=260031512
No way, it's such a thing ....\nWhat should I do?

ID=260031513
I really want to get back to you soon ....\nBut, that place is designated as an out of bounds area.

ID=260031514
Oh, that's right ... You are a member of the Union, are not you?\nCould you listen to one asking one?\nWith this thing, there is no face to match the deceased father.

ID=660031501
Please get rid of that monster! Please!\nI can not overlook my father's car being such a thing.

ID=660031502
Thank you! He should be on the coast road.

ID=360031501
It is a coastal road! It should be there.

ID=560031501
Did you get rid of monsters ...?

ID=560031502
That's right. Compared to that ... I ...

ID=560031503
I'm sorry for the deceased father about trying to give up on all this.\nEven though my father also saved my citizen life like yourself ....

ID=460031501
Oh, I did not introduce myself properly.

ID=460031502
My name is "Robert\

ID=460031503
I'm really thankful to you. I look forward to working with you.

ID=260032001
I see you again.

ID=260032002
From this time, I am going to stay in Kandus city.\nThanks.

ID=260032003
Well, I also have a jite together ....

ID=260032004
Oh, do not get me wrong! Because it does not come because there is a jite!\nBecause the Jite tells you to follow you ....

ID=260032005
I just sold more and just came to make a profit.\nSo, please never misunderstand.

ID=260032006
Well, leave that story, there is a favor to ask.\nThe goods were shipped from the merchant association a while ago,\nThere was a message that I can not come now.

ID=260032007
As I heard the story, the bridge collapsed due to the earthquake occurring over this side\nIt seems that she can no longer cross.

ID=260032008
As soon as you want to receive it, I can not leave it as it is.\nIf you do not mind, could you please find something useful for restoring the bridge?

ID=260032009
I saw the bridge a while ago, but it was not completely broken,\nOnly a part was broken. With a little hand it seems to be managed somehow.

ID=260032010
Even if there can manage to do anything, it should be possible to receive the goods.\nCan you please?

ID=660032001
Thank you very much. I think that if you go to the coastal road, you will get what you need.

ID=360032001
By the way, when I went to see the bridge a while ago, I shook a bit ... Maybe it is okay, is not it?

ID=560032001
Did you find things you asked for?

ID=460032001
Thank you very much. It was saved. This is enough.

ID=460032002
Well then, I am preparing to go to the bridge and receive the goods.

ID=260032501
Fuu ....

ID=260032502
Hello.

ID=260032503
Well, I am miserable myself at all.\nI can not stop worrying about the future.

ID=260032504
I can not forget about my father's car that became part of the monster. ... Wow.

ID=260032505
How scared when I left it there ...?

ID=260032506
While being surrounded by a monster, it was eroded little by little ... how much did it hurt ...?

ID=260032507
How sad were they when they became myself ...?

ID=260032508
Oh, because of this idea ... Oh, sorry. Do not mind my suggestions!

ID=660032501
(Something is necessary for Robert: Let's find traces of cars in concrete jungle)

ID=360032501
Huh

ID=560032501
%username% san ... What is this?

ID=460032501
A car's belongings ... is not it?\n... Thank you. Such a thing ... I will really recover this time!

ID=460032502
Again, I will do my best for this town!\nThank you,%username%!

ID=260033001
......

ID=260033002
Well, what should I do ...?

ID=260033003
I used the things I got in the hands to prepare to cross the bridge and picked it up ....

ID=260033004
Suddenly a monster like a stone appeared and broke the bridge.

ID=260033005
After all, the bridge collapsed and all the items ordered were buried under rubble.\nThere is no way to search anymore ....

ID=260033006
The shake that I said before and that monster,\nWhy on earth do you do this? I can not understand the idea of ​​a monster ....

ID=260033007
Huh ... what should I do? This regret ....\nI can not forgive you. ... Yes, can you defeat that monster?

ID=660033001
Thank you ... I hope I can never do this again.\nThank you for everyone else.

ID=360033001
If you go to the coastal road, you should have that monster.

ID=560033001
What happened to the monster?

ID=460033001
Thank you very much. Well, this does not come back with goods ....\nEven just being unable to get injured ... It was good.

ID=460033002
But the damage is not small ....\nI have to make more profit and take the original.

ID=260033501
Oh! Is not%username% san!

ID=260033502
Ha ha ha!\nNo, in fact it's been said that Yomi was saying that the customer would go to Kandus city.

ID=260033503
Hmm? Why did you follow? Well, why are there various reasons, the first is intuition.\n%username% got a feeling of becoming money. Besides, I have liked it for sure. my mother!

ID=260033504
Is it the same idea by Yomi, I said I was going to say I was going, but I ended up having to say it.\nPlease also see Yomi later.

ID=260033505
Oh, and I have one request but ... is it a bit of a good thing?

ID=260033506
Actually, I would like you to get a new grass.

ID=260033507
What kind of grasses are ... ... Hey, I like whatever grass that I like bitten now.

ID=260033508
Even though I came to a new city, it will not be a good idea to bite the same thing forever.\nMy muscles are also troubling that we need new grass power. Ha ha ha!

ID=260033509
I tried searching near by, but I do not like the grass that I like ....

ID=260033510
Will not you see the coastal road around the restricted area?\nI guess it was like there was a similar grass ....

ID=660033501
Thanks! Even grass you can help me with whatever I can!

ID=360033501
It still took a long time ...? Well, actually my muscles are missing if that leaf does not exist!\nWhy not! It's a joke. Ha ha ha!

ID=560033501
Oh! That's it! Well, it is saved! With this finally ....

ID=460033501
Well, this exhilaration! This youthfulness! Great power is going to end!\nYou can see the muscles shining without mind! Ha ha ha!

ID=460033502
Well, will you work hard again? Ha ha ha!

ID=260034001
Okay, will not you talk a little?

ID=260034002
You are the "hero" you came from Loco Town, are not you?

ID=260034003
Oh, sorry. I am Rita.\nI was doing business in Grace City a while ago, but I came here.

ID=260034004
Apparently ... You seem a bit tired? you.

ID=260034005
If you ask me a favor, I can give you some money.

ID=260034006
Oh, it's easy even if you ask me.\nI do not know what it is, but I'd like you to manage "ale" which interferes a person's sleep.

ID=260034007
I have never slept soundly since I moved here.

ID=260034008
Every night night ganggan! Livelying ....\nAre you doing construction on the coastal road? But I also need sleep ....

ID=260034009
Could you please stop that sound? You can use any kind of hands.\nAnyway, I want you to make sure that that sound does not sound. How? Easy, right?

ID=260034010
Oh, of course this is not a reliance for me alone.

ID=260034011
If I could sleep soundly, the job started properly the next day,\nResidents of Kandusity can also buy things. Right?

ID=260034012
Residents got things, I earn money.\nAnd that money to you ... is not it?\nMoney is not good unless you turn it.

ID=260034013
Why? When money stays, it rots around.\nMoney, people ... But money will not go out even if it goes bad.

ID=260034014
Me? I firmly use the money.\nFor example ... to you? Hehu ....

ID=260034015
If you do this job properly, I will pay you for future payment.\nThen you can make money from me and use the money for another thing, do not you?

ID=260034016
How? Is not it a wonderful cycle?\nI've already spoken to this point and you accept this job. I asked!

ID=660034001
Well then, I have another business so please do not mind.\nIf it goes well, I will pay for it.

ID=360034001
How long are you going to go grouse?

ID=560034001
Did you manage?

ID=460034001
Good job. I also do my work smartly ... I think I can use it quite easily.\nI will ask you if there is something next. See you.

ID=260034501
(There are some signs of people in the trash box)

ID=260034502
(When you move the trash can you hear people 's voice)

ID=260034503
Hey, stop it! Stop it! Want ... like a person sleeping soundly ....\nWhy do you wake it!

ID=660034501
....\n(It seems better to leave it alone. Let's ask someone else about the man in the trash box)

ID=360034501
... (Let's ask someone else about the man in the trash box)

ID=600345101
What's wrong?

ID=600345102
Oh, that trash can?\nA thing about Hiddinger?

ID=600345103
Well, I do not know well.\nRumor seems to have worked on biotechnology at Ned Company, but it seems he quit due to an accident or something.

ID=600345104
Since then, you will not hide in the trash can and will not come out.\nThere is a rumor that the whole body was burned, or because I am garbage it is in the trash can.

ID=600345105
Just because of rumors, I do not know anything certain.\nSo, do you want to talk to that person?

ID=600345106
Well ... there is no way though.

ID=600345107
He seems to be very interested in Seoul Junk.

ID=600345108
If someone was talking about Seoul Junk nearby,\nBefore I knew it was a trash box nearby. You look like a ghost story, huh?

ID=600345109
By doing so, listening to the story about Seoul Junk, I'm talking alone by myself.

ID=600345110
It seems to me that I'm talking about this ... because I usually need it.\nPerhaps I can do conversation if I take it.

ID=600345111
Well, this is about it.\nI do not know why I care about that person, why do not you try it?

ID=560034501
(Heidinger seems to be asleep)

ID=460034501
(Let's wait a while until he gets up)

ID=260035501
(It seems that Hiddinger woke up)

ID=260035502
(The garbage's dumping mouth opens, the two eyes patched from the inside are staring at me)

ID=260035503
do not come! Do not touch it!

ID=260035504
There is no talking. Go out somewhere without going! A human!

ID=260035505
(Ignore the words of the man in the trash box and wait)

ID=260035506

ID=260035507
(I heard a voice from inside after a while)

ID=260035508
... Damn, that widow! damn you! Oh, even that mouse could somehow ...! Wow!

ID=260035509
Or, there is a hard thing! Rigid things, stiff things ... Where are you! What? Is not it anything? Is not it?

ID=260035510
(I do not know what it is pointing to, but he seems to need a hard thing)

ID=660035501
(Let's pick something hard from Seoul Junk on the coastal road)

ID=560035501
(When pushing the concrete mass into the mouth of the trash box, the lid of the trash box opened after a while)

ID=460035501
And he did it! This is it! It is the one I wanted!\nNe, rodents will garbage boxes, so it was cold so I could not sleep! Thank you!

ID=460035502
The skin of the scone was bitten by the rats!\nNeither rodents will eat concrete, too!

ID=460035503
(What will happen with raising concrete soon for rats who are garbage garbage boxes already)

ID=460035504
Oh, oh ... you're a nice guy!\nSince it will not get angry from next time, sometimes ... come. Do not always come! I understand!

ID=260036001
Henry received a request? Even if you are a competent person of the affiliation affiliation,\nYou seem to be unable to pass through Ned 's people?

ID=260036002
However, luck is good. Ned is the only one to check, and the union is to use nerves.\nNeedless to say other things. It is not once or twice that I felt awful.

ID=260036003
Ned basically does anything for profit.\nIf you get a profit, you do not really care about human life.

ID=260036004
The appearance and name of the CEO is said to be the top secret ....\nIn fact the man named Rawen seems to be standing on the table and moving Ned.

ID=260036005
As a matter of fact, Henry is nothing more than a man named Rosen.\nFrom our point of view, it is that someone is a high-ranking person.

ID=260036006
If you are interested in Ned, visit Leona in the vicinity of Henry.\nI am an old friend who officially joined Ned. I am doing a direct secretary to Henry.

ID=660036001
Do you remember the pilot who supported you when you stop the big puppet?\nThat man and Leona are familiar from old days.

ID=660036002
I always play together.\nToday we are walking along different paths, but it was fun at that time.

ID=660036003
Anyway, if you tell Leona that it is my introduction, that's okay.\nI am a bit stubborn, but I am not a bad guy so be relieved.

ID=360036001
If you care about Ned, try visiting Leona.

ID=600360101
Hello. It is "Leona" who is a secretary at Ned Company.\nI heard that Ralf's introduction resulted in the appearance.

Huh? I do not want to join the company ...?\nWell, I have to say that I did what I did with ....

ID=600360110
I must sincerely apologize. In the future, I hope to join Ned Company\nIf there is a point to worry about, please ask at any time.

ID=560036001
How was it, could you talk?

ID=560036002
Hope to join the company?\nWell ... Leona's guy, it's a completely ned human.

ID=460036001
Well ... people are changing.\nIt is okay if you know even a little about Ned.

ID=260036501
Indeed, why should I look like this? Hey, why! What?

ID=260036502
This time I am involved in the "Starry Forest Union, who are they?\\nYou know what?

ID=260036503
... No way, you do not know?\nPhotographers have not told you?

ID=260036504

ID=260036505
To cooperate closely with each member of the Union,\nAbout them they went into the underground waterway ....

ID=260036506
Because of "that\\nI ran away with an unfriendly appearance!

ID=260036507
What is "that"? Rats! Mice!\nIt is decided to be a mouse!

ID=260036508
An enormous number of rats are already clumped ....\nUjou Shou ... Wow ....

ID=260036509
Such humiliation! I do not want to experience it again!

ID=260036510
But, when those mice come out ....\nWell! Why, I definitely will not go!

ID=260036511
I heard it with rumors of the wind, but you ... is it really true that it is a very different person?

ID=260036512
Can I ask a moment?\nI have to go over there again by coverage ....\nSo, can you get rid of that mouse?

ID=660036501
Alright. Well then, please.\nAh! Then look at this documentary, absolutely! Good?

ID=360036501
Hey, were you listening to people's story?

ID=560036501
The rat does not come out anymore?

ID=460036501
Okay! Well then, I have to go gathering.

ID=260037001
welcome. I have a new job, what do you think?

ID=260037002
Recently, there are things that are talking about among people in the town.

ID=260037003
Everything, such as seeing an alligator at the underground waterway .... Well, everything is ok with crocodiles.\nIt is money that I care about. Then it will be money.

ID=260037004
Oh, one other thing. Bag.

ID=260037005
Accessories for women like me ... bags in particular are important items.\nWhen you meet someone, the first thing you will notice is ... so, bag.

ID=260037006
I have various bags from olden days.\nHedia Mail, Diamond Hall, Vesuzuzu The Kuro's famous brand is basic.

ID=260037007
Until a bag made by famous craftsmen with valuable leather, most things are complete.

ID=260037008
But recently I got a slightly different idea.

ID=260037009
I also like things made by world famous brands and craftsmen,\nOnly one in this world. Do not you think that what was made only for me is wonderful?

ID=260037010
So be anxious about that crocodile ....\nHow? Why do not you check it out? If you are a crocodile you really want me to pick up the leather.

ID=260037011
Of course, if you bring it, I will pay for it.\nIf you bring a genuine crocodile ... but.

ID=660037001
Huh ... Thanks. Do not hurt if possible, do you? I asked.

ID=360037001
I wonder if we traded? Why are you still here?

ID=560037001
Did you bring crocodile skin?

ID=560037002
What, what is this? Huh? Was it Soul Junk?

ID=560037003
And I knew it was about that!\nWhat I'd like to say is why it is not skinned! Huh

ID=460037001
nothing I can do about it. Because I knew, throw such a thing.\nI can not give you all of the reward as it is different from the promise ....\nBecause I had a hard time I will give you a daily rent.

ID=460037002
After all, you can not believe people 's rumors.

ID=460037003
Huh, I thought you would decorate my collection's end.

ID=260037501
Oh, I was waiting! I just needed your strength!

ID=260037502
Recently, many people are suffering from the bad odor generated in the town.

ID=260037503
Fortunately there is no abnormality in drinking water,\nThrough sewage pipes, water in the whole town is beginning to be contaminated.

ID=260037504
Although it has not become a big problem yet,\nIn this way, the whole town may be short of water.

ID=260037505
Could you please explain why the water was contaminated with me?

ID=660037501
Thank you very much. For the time being, it seems necessary to follow rumors and investigate.

ID=660037502
Then, it is listening immediately.

ID=360037501
This bad smell bothers everyone! We need to resolve it immediately.

ID=600375101
Oh, to Chibi-chan until Robert. What happened?

ID=600375102
Huh? Are you investigating the foul odor of the sewage pipe?

ID=600375103
Well, if you do that, I will remember it ....

ID=600375104
I guess it was 2 days ago when I was putting the baggage I shipped from Grace City in the warehouse.

ID=600375105
I was working in the middle,\nSomewhere there was a terrible terrible smell.

ID=600375106
I thought that someone did something unnecessary ....\nAfter examining it was a smell from the sewer pipe.\nI immediately called a person, covered the drain pipe and transferred all the items to another place.

ID=600375107
Well, Rita's warehouse is located in the outskirts of the city.\nIf it is there, it should be close to the underground waterway.

ID=600375108
No way, there is a soul junk under the warehouse ...?

ID=600375109
That's still nothing .... For the time being we will return.

ID=600375110
That's right. Oh, Robert. I will give you the key of the warehouse just in case.\nPlease use it properly after using it. Good?

ID=560037501
For one moment ... According to Mr. Rita's story, the stench of the warehouse seemed to be worse than any place in the town ....\nHM. You need to focus on that.

ID=460037501
There is a key, and I go to the warehouse alone and check it.\nPlease wait a bit.

ID=260038001
Sorry I made you wait.

ID=260038002
For the moment, there are several things that have been revealed at Mr. Rita's warehouse.

ID=260038003
First of all, the odor in the warehouse was really impossible to say.\nAlthough it sealed, it was such a bad smell that it did not pass.

ID=260038004
After that, I confirmed the trace which seems to be a monster in the drain pipe.\nBecause things like mucus were mixed in the water flowing from the sewer pipe.

ID=260038005
Although I do not know in detail, in educational materials distributed by former Union members,\nI feel that there was contents similar to this mucus.

ID=260038006
Certainly, it seems that "A spider-like monster bleeds mucus" ....

ID=260038007
I do not know the cause, but a monster like that spider invaded the sewer pipe.\nOwing to that, it caused a stench, and the water was contaminated ... Is not it?

ID=660038002
Please%%username% get rid of groundwater spiders and reduce the number.\nSo if the smell gets lighter, let the troops report and treat them.

ID=660038001
I surveyed the part connected to the underground waterway at Rita's warehouse,\nI think I will completely block it.

ID=360038001
that? Have not you started yet?\nI will not close the sewer pipe unless you knock down a spider monster. Please hurry.

ID=560038001
Did you get rid of a spider monster?

ID=560038002
Rita 's warehouse will no longer smell bad.\nBut, there are still bad smells around town ... You have to see a little more ....

ID=460038001
For the moment, I think I should look elsewhere.

ID=260038501
%username%! I got a definitive clue!

ID=260038502
I think that you already know that there is a monster in the underground waterway.

ID=260038503
Among them, there are the most spider monsters,\nIt seems that it has been driven away from its original habitat by a new kind of monster.

ID=260038504
Due to that influence, it began to enter the underground channel and reach the sewer pipe,\nThere was a stench spreading throughout the town.

ID=260038505
It seems not to be a problem only of spider monsters that have been torn down before.\nThe odor in the town will not be solved unless the new monster is also eliminated.

ID=260038506
Please. Go to the underground waterway and get rid of that monster!

ID=660038501
A monster enough for that spider monster to escape ....\nI can not imagine it at all.

ID=660038502
Please do not push yourself.\nYou are an important person.

ID=360038501
Work is done without fail. be careful.\n... I am afraid that I can not go directly.

ID=560038501
how was it? The underground waterway is ....

ID=560038502
Is it a huge ... crocodile ...? Is that such a groundwater?

ID=560038503
The new monster was that monster.\nAnyway, it's safe and on top.

ID=560038504
Thank you very much.\nThis incident was resolved thanks to%username%.

ID=460038501
... Is enviable. If you have the power like you ... you can save a lot of people ....

ID=460038502
However, I have not felt dissatisfied with my present self.\nBecause that is not the only force needed to rebuild this town.

ID=460038503
Will and passion, and efforts. Oh, and a little money. Haha.

ID=460038504
I really appreciate your work. I will return to ordinary life.\nIf you have something to help you, please come at any time!

ID=260039001
Seoul Junk in the underground waterway ... No way it will be such a thing.\nBut this may be a good opportunity in some respects.

ID=260039002
I do not know whether human beings are applicable, but underground waterways are for some animals and plants\nIt is no exaggeration to say that it is a great place where self-sufficiency is possible.

ID=260039003
Oh, Seoul Junk can be self-sufficient, basically anywhere.\nNo matter how weak environments survive.

ID=260039004
However, there is no data on soul junk in a place where self-sufficiency is possible.\nCurrently, places where they can be self-sufficient are limited.

ID=260039005
In other words, Seoul Junk survive any harsh place,\nIn places where self-sufficiency is possible, we need to find out what kind of ecology it is doing.

ID=260039006
Would you go to the underground canal and get mucus?\nThe target is ... around "Venomuukusu" is good.

ID=660039001
Also, because I can not proceed this matter directly this time too ....\nI have to leave it to other people.

ID=660039002
The block seems to be busy, it will be hard to leave the job any longer.\nIt seems better to put in another strength.

ID=660039003
I heard that you are acquainted with Leona ... is it true?

ID=660039004
As expected after all. That's good.\nWill you hand me mucus from Venomu Muskas to Leona?

ID=660039005
I and Leona are acquaintances from a long time ago.\nAs for Seoul Junk, I became friends because I was interested in each other.

ID=660039006
A member of the Safety Federation Association and a secretary of Ned Company\nIt is likely to be a little even if you look around from ... that you are making friends ...?\nRecently, I can not keep talking in places where there are a lot of public attractions.

ID=660039007
So%username%, will you give me the mucilage of Venomucus to Leona?\nI will contact Leona in advance by email.

ID=660039008
Well ... You have a face that you said something.

ID=660039009
It is a cooperative relationship on the surface, but in fact it is a bad Ned Company\nI wonder why you are offering such things?\nActually, the same thing happened to the block once.

ID=660039010
But, I think the premise of this problem is wrong.\nIt may be bad with each other, but are those who are moving for the human race of Crow Dream after all?

ID=660039011
Which goes ahead and which is behind ... I do not think there's any significant meaning in such competition.\nIf it is useful for human beings, which one can win?

ID=660039012
Well then, I'm counting on you.

ID=360039001
Will you go to the underground canal and get the mucilage of Venomucus, will you deliver it to Leona?

ID=560039001
Good morning.\nAs you already know, I will be in charge of the investigation of related contents.

ID=560039002
I think that it is not necessary to lengthen the story.\nPlease show me what I brought.

ID=560039003
Let's see what singularity is there.

ID=560039004
This is a poisonous toy. It is considerably more toxic than the existing vacuum bay.\nAlmost ... It's a chemical weapon level.

ID=560039005
It is a new discovery that is not in the materials so far.\nThis is the first case where mucilage itself has an offensive attribute.

ID=560039006
This is the opposite of general evolution of life forms.\nNormally, in harsh environments it will evolve to be stronger and sure to survive accordingly.

ID=560039007
Conversely, in a rich environment the militant elements disappear,\nOnly certain characteristics are enhanced. Humans are a typical example.

ID=560039008
The underground waterway is the best environment for Seoul Junk to live.\nNevertheless, it means that it evolved so fightingly like this ....\nThat means it is completely against the existing evolutionary standards.

ID=560039009
... Again Seoul Junk seems to be unable to make judgments on the standards of general life forms.\nAnyway, we conduct a thorough investigation on this subject and release it as official material.

ID=460039001
Congratulations. Also thank you next time.

ID=260039501
It is also a matter of time for Kandas city to collapse.\nSupplies are short and buildings are collapsing one by one.

ID=260039502
Well, it does not surprise me because it is a daily routine.\n... But the buildings that are likely to collapse this time are somewhat different.

ID=260039503
It is a skyscraper, but according to the simulation\nIf it collapses, small buildings in the surroundings will fall in domino style.

ID=260039504
In the end it may be a building that will end without being used.\nBut someday the day will pick up here maybe ....\nMore than anything, it 's pretty luxurious. That building.

ID=260039505
I do not know anything else, but only the collapse of that building must be prevented.\nI need the material for that ... but that building a little using special materials.

ID=260039506
Materials that are not being produced now .... Soft but hardened at the moment of adding heat,\nIt is a new substance that demonstrates excellent durability.

ID=260039507
It is mainly used for military purposes now. Even though there is no stock, even a small amount can be obtained.\nSo, I need something to replace it.

ID=260039508
... I'd like you to get something of that.

ID=660039501
Huh? What should I bring? ... I left it!\nI am a strategy soldier! If you think about the strategy it is OK! My mother ...!

ID=660039502
Well, try somehow?

ID=360039501
Well, maybe it's Funafuna, but I wish something stiff ... is it?\nHuhuhu!

ID=560039501
this?

ID=560039502
Wow ... this soft texture ....\nWell, why do not you try adding a little heat?

ID=560039503
Oh, it got harder! This can be used.\nBut how did you get this?

ID=460039501
secret? Wow ... that's suspicious. Well.\nEverything is okay if it ends.

ID=260040001
Is it a soul worker soul junked ...?\nIt is disastrous as the end of those who have always fought at the forefront.

ID=260040002
I do not know if the emotions remain in the soul junk,\nIt should be painful for sure. It was taken into the object to be knocked down.

ID=260040003
Release him.\nNo more ... do not suffer.

ID=660040001
Relax in the past, soul workers who fought for everyone ....

ID=360040001
Peace of mind to soul worker soul junk ....

ID=560040001
What was he thinking at the end?\nThanks to us ...? Or hate ...?

ID=560040002
Is this the price for shed blood for you!\n... I wonder what you thought ...?

ID=560040003
... Well, can you figure it out?\nThe person's heart is understood only by that person.

ID=560040004
... You do not look like that.\nWell, the end is over. Why do not you do other business as well?

ID=460040001
I ... I want to take a short break.

ID=260040501
Well ... I can not remember ....\nOh,%username%. Can you help me for a moment?

ID=260040502
I am planning to submit a report on Seoul Junk 's walking method to the headquarters,\nThere are things I can not remember ...

ID=260040503
It is a walking method of "Dark Lizard."\nWell ... I still can not remember ....

ID=260040504
Lizard is basically walking quadruped, is not it?\nBut, depending on the type, there are cases of biped walking.

ID=260040505
Was it a biped walk or a quadruped walk?\nI will report it properly walking three legs ...?

ID=260040506
Oh no ... No. I can not report that it is not sure.\nWill you investigate the walking method of dark lizard for a moment?

ID=660040501
Whatever trivial thing to do, it is the information that gathers information.\nThat's why you gather reliable information.

ID=360040501
Dark Lizard how to walk ... Good luck.

ID=560040501
How was it? Bipedalism? Quadruped walking?\nNo way ... Walking three legs?

ID=560040502
Huh? Do not you remember?\nNo, I did explain so much ...!

ID=560040503
Is it all I can do by fighting .... There is no room to watch.\nSorry Sorry.

ID=460040501
Let's make it that Dark Lizard ... was not there.\nLater, I should say it is a new kind of soul junk. Hehu ....

ID=260041001
I am also honored to see you again.\nFormal self-introduction was still not done.\nMy name is Ned Company Secretary "Leona".

ID=260041002
I was very sorry last time.\nI heard from Ralph, but he seems to be a very competent person.

ID=260041003
So, there are things I want to ask personally.\nPlease get mucus from Seoul junk.

ID=260041004
You do not need to get much in particular.\nDuring battle, things that are adequate for weapons and clothing are sufficient.

ID=260041005
Recently Ned Company has produced a new detergent "Shift Delete".\nThis detergent removes all foreign matter almost perfectly ... but.

ID=260041006
We can not confirm the cleaning ability for foreign matter secreted from soul junk.\nIf the foreign matter can be removed cleanly, the advertising effect will be tremendous.

ID=260041007
Please battle the object that seems to be particularly filthy at Seoul Junk and return.\nI think that it is appropriate per the codename "Cruise cell".

ID=660041001
Thank you very much.\nWe'll be expecting you.

ID=360041001
Combat with the codename "Crude Cell" and please return.

ID=560041001
Thank you for your hard work.\nLet's try the performance of shift delete quickly.

ID=460041001
Th-This is! It became beautiful like a lie!\n... but, be satisfied with this degree.

ID=460041002
In order to make it perfect, you need to do some research.\nWe will also contact you as soon as the matter occurs. Thank you for your cooperation.

ID=260042001
I have been waiting for you.\nThank you for your cooperation once again with regard to "shift delete".

ID=260042002
"Shift delete" is what Ned Company made,\nIt is natural to overwhelm existing detergents.

ID=260042003
So I think I will set a little higher goal this time.\nI heard that there is Seoul Junk whose surface is covered with poisonous toxic substances.

ID=260042004
Please fight against that soul junk and return home.\nAs long as you hear the story, it is supposed to be the individual who has the most toxic mucus among the existing soul junk.

ID=260042005
If even it could be removed ....\nThe position of Shift Delete will not be shaken in the coming decades.

ID=260042006
Then, it is the last request.\nPlease fight against the codename "Venomuukusu" and return.

ID=660042001
We'll be expecting you.

ID=360042001
Please battle with the codename "Venomuukusu" and return.

ID=560042001
We will confirm the performance immediately.

ID=560042002
Hmm ...? This is ....

ID=560042003
It does not fall.\nThe surface just became a little clean.

ID=560042004
... There is nothing I can do.\nIt seems necessary to add some improvement.

ID=560042005
Thank you very much.\nThanks to that, I will be able to take a step forward without becoming arrogant.

ID=460042001
Well then, we will call you if there is any further request.\nThank you for your hard work.

ID=260042501
By the way, do you know about the mutation in Seoul Junk?\nChanges appear in the appearance, and its power is also overwhelmingly different from existing ones.

ID=260042502
I have been conducting research on this for a long time\nIt is true that we have not been able to produce results like this yet.

ID=260042503
However, I already know the cause.\nIt is an abnormal phenomenon that occurs when you predispose the same species.

ID=260042504
However, I do not know what the principle is.\nBesides, it is also a mystery that certain power such as heat becomes strong if it is heat.

ID=260042505
Mutations occurred simply because cognate predation occurred,\nHaving stronger power than existing ... It can not end with that alone.\nBecause it is not an observation report.

ID=260042506
That is why I can not do research.\nBecause my ability also has limitations ....

ID=260042507
So, if you do not mind, please ask Mr. Hijinger for a story.\nAs you may know, he is a person who is familiar with the field of biotechnology.

ID=660042501
Could you explain the circumstances to that person, please hear the information?\nIt is something I can do if I go, but a little smell of the trash can ... I'm sorry.

ID=360042501
Please listen to the principle of mutation from Mr. Hiddinger.

ID=600425101
What? Suddenly what for you!

ID=600425102
And mutation? Why do mutations happen ...?

ID=600425103
Because it fights! Two nuclei, together in cognate predation,\nIt's because we fight each other!

ID=600425104
In that process, in order to win the opponent 's core ....\nAnd evolve! Evolution while fighting!

ID=600425105
Well, the last nucleus that survived ....\nKeep evolving phases when you fight against another nucleus!

ID=600425106
So, cognate predation becomes stronger and its appearance changes too!

ID=600425107
Then, if you would like to investigate ....\nWhy do not you investigate the nucleus of the guy who cheated!

ID=600425108
Les, Leona! If you are Leona and Victor you will understand at a glance!\nYes, they can surely do!

ID=600425109
I already sleep!\nDo not come any more! Because it is useless!

ID=560042501
When cognate predation occurred, each other's nuclear fight ....\nIt evolves in the process, eventually becoming a mutation ....

ID=560042502
There were such reasons that all of the nuclei of the mutation we got so far were full of scratches.\nI thought it was only damaged and throw it away. It is a waste.

ID=460042501
understood. Congratulations.\nWe change the corresponding information to public information.

ID=260043001
%username%. Thank you for helping me last time. Thanks to shooting the shoot went well.

ID=260043002
I decided to start a new documentary from today.\nThe reaction of promotion at the broadcasting station was good, and it was decided to prepare the next project already.

ID=260043003
"Soul junk, who are they?"

ID=260043004
Soul junk ... the identity of the monster we are talking about,\nMany people are unfamiliar.

ID=260043005
In this era, to tell what what we came across.\nThat's the theme of this documentary!

ID=260043006
I think that it will definitely be a dangerous project, unlike last time.\nBut that much, we know that we do not know anything about them,\nIt is also an opportunity to make people aware.

ID=260043007
A person named Spears who was a playwright and a novelist long ago says like this.\n"There is no deeper dark than ignorance."

ID=260043008
I think that more people should know the hidden reality.

ID=260043009
Cynthia agreed with my idea and tried to interview actively.\nHowever ....

ID=260043010
A problem also occurred at the shooting location this time as well.

ID=260043011
I tried to start shooting at the abandoned mansion in the outline of the town ....\nSuddenly a huge number of caterpillar-like monsters appeared.

ID=260043012
Fortunately, I got a story with the help of a member who was escorting from the Union ....\nI can not start shooting as it is.

ID=260043013
So, I beg you! Get rid of that caterpillar!\nI hope you can not come out near the shooting location.

ID=260043014
If it appears during shooting, Cynthia will surely scream and run away again.\nOh, it is a woman with quite a few weak points.

ID=660043001
Well then, I asked.

ID=360043001
Have not you got ridding yet? Get rid of quickly while preparing to shoot.

ID=560043001
Was it possible to get rid of caterpillar?

ID=460043001
Was saved. I was always just asking for help.\nYes, why do not you join the shoot? You have a chance to appear on TV.

ID=460043002
Huh? Do not want it? Then ... it can not be helped.\nWell, I will start preparing for shooting. Let's meet again!

ID=260043501
Ha, why did you tell me to interview?

ID=260043502
Hey, you ask me a moment.

ID=260043503
I knew from the very beginning that the interview is hard.\nWell, it is almost daily, so I'm used to some extent.

ID=260043504
I like stories. I'm at work.\nBut, should we relax as much as private?

ID=260043505
Yet it is? Is not it? Spiders came out at my house this time! !

ID=260043506
After the interview was over I went home and went to bed,\nI came down from the ceiling where I came in and tried to attack me!

ID=260043507
I thought the heart would pop out! I can not sleep on that day.\nThe bear under my eyes will not disappear today ... Do you understand this difficulty?

ID=260043508
Do not leave it as it is,%username%.

ID=260043509
I saw it with a previous intro shoot, but the spider's cocoon on the house? egg? There was a massive one.\nThe spider that came out to my room surely came from there.

ID=260043510
Because it is so? It was not so far from my room, and I saw a spider cocoon of such a size for the first time.

ID=260043511
So, I want you to destroy all that spider's cocoon or egg.\nI will not allow anyone to prevent my sleep.

ID=660043501
That's why, come back soon!

ID=360043501
what? You have not done it yet? Come back soon!

ID=560043501
What happened to the spider?

ID=460043501
Ha, this is relieved. Even though it's hard work,\nIt is truly the worst that you will be disturbed until the only rest.

ID=460043502
Anyway, I was saved. You may ask me again the next, do not you?

ID=260044001
Oh, welcome.

ID=260044002
By the way, I recently asked you to go to the residence in the outskirts.

ID=260044003
Actually. When I was little I lived in the neighborhood of the mansion.\nI was not very close but I went to see it.\nThe mansion in those days was a bit different now.

ID=260044004
In the garden in which various flowers are in bloom ... The wall and building entangled with ivy.\nIt was like a place in a fairy tale.

ID=260044005
But now it has become a monster 's den of the blank due to the blank.

ID=260044006
... You can not do it. Many people lost their lives by monsters ....\nIt is now becoming the deceased person who was bound there.

ID=260044007
To tell the truth. It is for the people in this town that I started a business here.

ID=260044008
There is no other town, gentleness is overflowing ... it was such a place.\nI helped a lot like that to everyone ....

ID=260044009
%username%, I wonder if I can make them easy now.\nThey have been tied up all the time. I already want to give it a rest.

ID=660044001
Thank you. It makes me happy that they sleep peacefully.

ID=360044001
I think that time of memorial is also good. But what they need is rest.

ID=560044001
You have released them.

ID=560044002
Thank you. With this you will be able to sleep peacefully.

ID=560044003
Yo, it's pat, Rita. Good morning.

ID=560044004
Shooting was too long, were not you? Hugh?

ID=560044005
This is still a shorter one. Well, I will be rude with this.

ID=560044006
......

ID=560044007
What's wrong? Have you photographed until now?\nYes Yes. Even in business in such a town, a certain degree of advertisement is necessary.

ID=560044008
Well, it was a situation I had to use you.

ID=560044009
Whatever its shape, you start to trade it only after appealing to someone?

ID=460044001
Oh, no. I did what I did, so I have to give you a reward!\nWell then.

ID=460044002
It is a face that I can not accept.\nWas it all a lie that the past that I was talking about a while ago?

ID=460044003
Huh ... I wonder? Chibi-chan.

ID=260044501
long time no see. %username%.

ID=260044502
When you come to this town, you will miss the air of Locotown.

ID=260044503
Haha, I'm sorry. I did not call it to do such a story.\nYou seem to be floating up in a new town.

ID=260044504
As you know what we are talking about, the Crow Dream Alliance Bank,\nI have gathered information from various fields, but I got information that is one concern.

ID=260044505
Spider type Soul Junk seen in Locotown ... Do you remember?

ID=260044506
It seems that the spider Soul junk appeared here, too,\nSomething strange.

ID=260044507
The spider-type soul junk that appeared in Candas City until now,\nThree or more types are confirmed even if you estimate less.

ID=260044508
It seems that it has been found elsewhere,\nThe information we got is this degree ....

ID=260044509
So, there is something I would like to ask%username%.

ID=260044510
There is "Meltinis cell" in the arachnoid soul junk.\nI need to investigate that ... I was short of samples.\nCould you please collect it?

ID=660044501
Thank you very much. Thank you.

ID=360044501
It is enough to get a sample of "Meltinis Cell". There is not much needed.

ID=560044501
Did you get samples?

ID=560044502
Is this the sample you got? Let's investigate immediately.

ID=460044501
Thank you very much. That's right. Their work is worthy of evaluation.\nPlease also do the next one.

ID=260045001
The whole house is becoming their daughter.\nBig news, is not it.

ID=260045002
You do not have to worry about the Nerd company 's orolo.\n"Ned Company! Experiment of Betrayal!" Is it a feeling?\nWell, there is no such courageous person.

ID=260045003
Ah, civilians who are courageous from anyone,\nI wonder if you will reveal all the bad deeds of the Ned Company.

ID=260045004
Well, aside from that.\nThere is something I have to do somehow.

ID=260045005
Flying type Soul junk flying around the house ... Do you remember?\nCode name "Vacuum Bain". Yes, with the same name as the material that will become Seoul junk.

ID=260045006
If the vacuum vane has the power to take in the surroundings, dissolve and homogenize,\nHe has the power to promote soul junk through meat bullet charge.

ID=260045007
I guess you are going to hear what they are like syringes ...?\nI will dig into living organisms and promote soul junking.\nBecause it is small and flying type, it is quite troublesome.

ID=260045008
It's okay now because I am just flying around the house,\nIt will be a catastrophe once it comes out of the mansion.

ID=260045009
It seems that you can not demonstrate your power in a beautiful place that is weak against sunlight,\nYou do not know what evolution they will evolve?

ID=260045010
I have to handle anxiety factors early.\nI went to the mansion and cleaned up the vacuum vane cleanly.

ID=660045001
Do not look sweet. Because the opponent is soul junk because it is small.

ID=360045001
Enter the mansion and clean up the codename "Vacuum Vane" from one end.

ID=560045001
OK, this is a little relieved.

ID=460045001
... It is enough for a human being to become a soul junk ... enough.\nNo more ... I will not let the victims come out.

ID=260045501
I'm waiting. I have a favor to ask.

ID=260045502
A while ago I was caught in a small ear when I was talking with an association member,\nIn Seoul Junk, there are some who were originally human beings.

ID=260045503
There are many opinions about this, but for the moment I am the one who believes.\nThere are things that I witnessed directly.

ID=260045504
Regarding this story, there are many problems on the side of the broadcasting station.\nIf there are those who were truly human among them, what should we do?

ID=260045505
Also, is it okay to broadcast this thing? What ....

ID=260045506
It is definitely dangerous. Because people may be among them.\nWe thought that they are different worlds and have different dimensions until now ....

ID=260045507
If it is broadcasted that "There was Seoul Junk that was a human being in it"\nIt will give another citizen a different shock than before.

ID=260045508
That 's why it is a matter of necessity.\nAgain, Cynthia showed a position to approve of picking this up.

ID=260045509
It is a woman like a mass of frustrated temperament of a tremendous princess on top of himself ....\nI'm pretty sure about it. That's why I followed her ever ....

ID=260045510
... Oops, that's a story. Anyway, I would like to ask about this matter,\nEvidence about the soul junk that the crew was talking ... Please collect it.

ID=260045511
It seems that a spider and a human are fusing together, but I do not know the details.\nI would like you to gather evidence related to it ... will you do it?

ID=260045512
Based on that, decide whether to broadcast or edit as it is. I'm counting on you.

ID=660045501
Well then I asked. We call an expert and prepare for shooting.

ID=360045501
Is it still? Collect as soon as possible. Shooting is already over.

ID=560045501
Is this evidence ...?

ID=460045501
How much can a viewer accept the results after investigating this ...?\nHowever, it is certain to bring about a big debate.

ID=460045502
I am always sorry. I will ask you again.

ID=260046001
%username%, just ask a moment.

ID=260046002
Really from next to next ... I can not take it anymore.

ID=260046003
Where do you think it came from this time? Take a bath! What? bath! And the moment I was about to enter! What?

ID=260046004
I was floating a rose flower in the bath to change my mood, and I dropped plenty of luxury aromatic oil.\nOf course, prepare cheese for wine, too.

ID=260046005
The moment I tried to take a bath even though I prepared it so far ...!

ID=260046006
Well, come in through the window of the bath,\nI fell down on the cork of wine and stared at me! What?

ID=260046007
Hey, I am getting tired anymore ....\nWhy are my spaces always spiders always on? Hey?

ID=260046008
Just do not get rid of a small spider. %username%.\nSpiders on the mansion! That whole spider! You know! What? Get rid of all of them!

ID=660046001
I will let you know what will happen if you make me angry!

ID=360046001
Are not you going yet? Spiders are bothering me ...?\nIf I collapse, how much do you think the audience will be sad? Come quickly!

ID=560046001
Have everyone done it?

ID=460046001
Fuu thank you. But why will you come into my room?\nI feel like I have not finished ....

ID=260046501
I understand! The reason spider comes out to my room!

ID=260046502
If you talk about spiders to Hugh,\nAt the time of shooting at the mansion, the upper body saw a spider.

ID=260046503
That monster hid all the time shooting and you should see me!

ID=260046504
... What is that? Did you mean? Are you sending spiders ... No way ...?

ID=260046505
Kyaaaaaaaaa! ! !

ID=260046506
How are you doing! I was stoked ... well ... well,\nIt is the first time for a spider to be stoked! How do you do? Hey ...!

ID=260046507
There is only you who can ask.

ID=260046508
%username%. Please! Do not do this again never again!

ID=660046501
I told you that Hugh saw it at the mansion, so you should probably go to the mansion.

ID=360046501
Did you? Huh? Not yet? You, I'm so drunk though it looks like this?

ID=560046501
Were you successful?

ID=560046502
Huh, can you live peacefully with this?\nYou can relax relaxed fatigue in the bath right?

ID=460046501
... But I guess it was a bit sad.\nSpiders and their spiders ... Are they really involved?

ID=460046502
Well, maybe not? Haha ....

ID=260047001
Hello. %username%.

ID=260047002
Somehow, I feel like I'm always asking you.

ID=260047003
Well, I still have not lost, so will you visit me like this?

ID=260047004
Then it is straightforward. As a result of collecting information,\nSpider type Soul junk confirmed that there is a decisive existence leading to the evolution so far.

ID=260047005
I do not know whether the code name designation is done in the coalition,\nFor the moment, we call it "Queen" for convenience.

ID=260047006
Although it is not well reflected in our camera,\nIn the back of the mansion in the outskirts of Kandathiti, individuals that seemed to be queen were confirmed.

ID=260047007
Evolution of spider-type soul junk from that queen, or\nWill you get anything that might possibly promote metamorphosis?

ID=660047001
There is no unprecedented worldwide existence that has achieved such insane evolution.\nIf it can be clarified only by that secret, common sense around us should be covered.

ID=360047001
The queen 's place is behind the mansion. I think that going there is painful,\nIt will surely be done if%username%. Be careful.

ID=560047001
how was it?

ID=460047001
Is this what you got from Queen ...? It is the same as other Seoul junk ....\nI will take care of this once. I will investigate here.

ID=460047002
It is unknown how much change this will bring to us,\nSurely this, its presence alone should be worth enough.

ID=460047003
I appreciate it. To your work, sincerely.

ID=460047004
Oh, if you can ask another one ... keep it in the coalition.\nWell then ....

ID=260047501
%username%. I'm asked again.

ID=260047502
As a result of investigating here, the possibility that human beings will become soul junk is\nThere was a hypothesis that there was some extent.

ID=260047503
However, there are still lacking samples to base on.\nIt is stopped from the top for the reason that the sample is insufficient as it is.

ID=260047504
There it is. Will you get another sample?

ID=660047501
I'm sorry. This should be your last request to ask you for this shoot.

ID=660047502
What I want is a sample resembling a red crust.\nCollect as many of it as possible.

ID=360047501
Other spiders on the mansion should be able to gather similar samples.

ID=560047501
Did samples gather?

ID=560047502
Alright, compare this with the result.

ID=560047503
Shooting takes off at last. When this was broadcast to the general public,\nThere is expectation, what kind of reaction will come, there is also terrible.\nIt might be damaged by Hita Sister Cynthia ....

ID=460047501
Thank you. Cynthia and I have been taken care of by you.\nI enjoyed working together.

ID=260048001
Hey, I was waiting.\nWhen I was studying mutation related information released by Leona\nI contacted him because I had something to worry about.

ID=260048002
Given that the scar on the core of the mutation is a trace of evolution by battle,\nThere is no choice but to investigate the nucleus again.

ID=260048003
... Considering the nuclear we have thrown up to now ... Haa, it is obvious.\nNo, it's over. I regretted it ... I guess.

ID=260048004
It is bad as it seems to mow the seeds sown by himself,\nI would like you to get the nucleus of the soul junk that caused the mutation.

ID=260048005
Anything that caused the mutation does not matter.\nI am not particular about the type.

ID=660048001
If you are going to strongly specify the target ....\n"Dark worm" and "Meltinis cell" ... Is it about perhaps "Duke Spider"?

ID=660048002
Will not the results be reported to Leona again this time?\nTrue ... It's a bad job.\nWhen will it become a formal member?

ID=360048001
I am struggling to make my wipe clean,\nIt's an opportunity to get mutation type information.\nI have asked for you.

ID=560048001
You got a mutant type nucleus, did not he?\nMany of these scars ... I think you should discard it anyway.

ID=560048002
So it can be said that we have discarded this in some ways.\n... Excuse me. We will start investigating immediately.

ID=560048003
......

ID=560048004
Heidinger is exactly as you said.\nThere are marks that the nucleus forming cells have heated and expanded or metamorphosed.

ID=560048005
The act of eating a family may be simple,\nIt seems that the internal nuclear fighters are fighting intensely.

ID=560048006
... There is something to worry about. Soul junk basically has no emotions.\nNevertheless, mutations are born and it is evolving through battle ....

ID=560048007
It's as though it is burning warfare.\nIt seems like the opponent does not deprive the initiative ....

ID=560048008
... Is Seoul Junk really a feelingless existence?

ID=560048009
... No way, it can not be such a thing. Mr. Hiddinger said that nuclear weapons fight,\nActually, it should only be an energy reaction that occurs at the time of fusion.

ID=460048001
... yeah, surely it is ... surely ....

ID=260048501
I was waiting,%username%.

ID=260048502
Have you heard about it yet? Things at the facility owned by Ned Company ....

ID=260048503
Have you already been to the scene? Then it was just fine.

ID=260048504
If you look directly, the story is quick. In what condition did the researcher go to ...?

ID=260048505
It seems that something like this happened due to the failure of the experiment that Ned had done ....\nApparently, it seems that some special substance is involved.

ID=260048506
Since Ned is also a situation, there seems to be no idea to collect substances in a state of silence ....\nIf you do not mind, will you lend me the power?

ID=260048507
In order to settle the situation, I heard that Ned got permission to enter N-102.

ID=260048508
It is a very dangerous bet, but if you bring the substance,\nYou should be able to use it as an important card for Ned.

ID=260048509
If you pay, I will prepare any money.

ID=260048510
You can tell them directly, but you'll endanger your own lives.\nBecause they are also inconvenient to know secrets.

ID=260048511
But, I am a little different.\nFor them, the existence of me is a thing that can not be easily eliminated. Hehe ...

ID=260048512
Then, please investigate the infected experiments and researchers within N-102.\nThere must be substances within them that are the core of this incident.

ID=660048501
Please be careful. Even if it is known to Ned,\nEven if it is known to the Union it will only make the impression worse.

ID=360048501
After finishing the research of the research building in N-102, it is at my place.

ID=560048501
Did you find the substance?

ID=560048502
This is an example new substance ....

ID=560048503
I know that it is dangerous to see me without any knowledge.\nThank you very much.

ID=460048501
We still need to investigate, but since the Ned side is reluctant to know this existence,\nThere is no mistake that there is something. I will deposit this substance.

ID=460048502
Then, when there is something again please do. Thank you for your hard work.

ID=260049001
I want it, the troubles are next to next ...!\nIt looks like a nectar fucking!

ID=260049002
In response to the request for collection of the research materials remaining in N-102, it would be nice to head to the site\nA shit like a defensive device attacked me.

ID=260049003
It is also a polite way to the heart ....\nIt was good as it was because there was a bulletproof vest, but it was nearly dangerous.

ID=260049004
Is that facility, Ned, is not it?\nWhy are you attacking people? Besides, try a heart!

ID=260049005
It is a place I do not want to go again, request a request. I do not have time to notice scary.\nWill you ask Leona if you can fix the target identification code of the defense device?

ID=660049001
It is a hard time for my chest to throb and move.\nWell, even if money was not involved I would never take such a thing like this!

ID=360049001
Will you ask Leona if you can fix the identification code?

ID=600490101
That's impossible.

ID=600490102
Yes, it is impossible.\nN-102 is a place that executive class manages directly.

ID=600490103
In order to correct something inside the N-102, you need directives from the executives.\nThen, he ordered Ralf is Henry who is an executive.

ID=600490104
In other words, it means that we collect all of these things and collect the materials.

ID=600490105
Ralf tends to process things very briefly.\nIt was so from long ago.

ID=600490106
Anyway, we can not modify everything inside the N - 102.\nThere is no room for correction from now on.

ID=560049001
Well, impossible.\nWell, what does it mean that I try to handle things easily?

ID=560049002
That woman who seemed to be harder than a 100 - year - old big tree, was saying that?\nBecause it is such a thing, still can not be a lover, the secretary of a vice company is stopping ... ertite.

ID=460049001
Anyway, I got it.\nIt is also life-threatening to eat.

ID=260049501
Well, I have something I'd like to ask a little.

ID=260049502
Yesterday evening, I was organizing the warehouse by myself.\nThen, suddenly I heard a loud noise from nearby ....

ID=260049503
thief! What? ghost! What? ... How trembling I was hiding and holding weapons ....

ID=260049504
Suddenly, when thinking that a large group of rats appeared,\nI went into the direction of N-102 and I was surprised.

ID=260049505
......

ID=260049506
... I know. Is it the main theme of the story, is not it?

ID=260049507
Well, actually, when I saw that flock, I saw something that shone red inside the mouse.\nIt looks like a jewel ...? Anyway, is not it strange?

ID=260049508
So I want you to catch a mouse and bring it with you.

ID=660049501
Thank you very much.

ID=360049501
Do not you think? truly?

ID=560049501
Well ... this is how it is ...? Um ... It sticks to the rat ... ....

ID=560049502
It seems that my eyes were dazzling with greed.

ID=460049501
I will try to avoid this failure next time.

ID=460049502
... Sorry.

ID=260050001
Oh, Ordon 's guy is a really nice guy. I will not eat food!

ID=260050002
You owe me your power, odoro. That is dangerous. It's very dangerous!

ID=260050003
Oh and Odon as well, but an ordinary person should touch it!\nThat substance ... honestly dangerous. I have to do something.

ID=260050004
I know how to make that substance no more possible.

ID=260050005
Just break my suspicious cocoon in the laboratory.

ID=260050006
Generate pseudo-blank phenomenon in the cocoon in the laboratory and decompose and reconstruct the substance inside.\nThat substance is produced there. So, if you touch it poorly it will be taken in!

ID=660050001
Do not infect your substance, too, be careful!\nDo not get close when infected!

ID=360050001
Laboratory! Well, there are lots of cocoons. Break them all!

ID=560050001
Did you destroy all the cocoons? Even if infected ... then, do not come close!

ID=460050001
Huh? Is not it infected? That's good. Well, this should not be made anymore ....

ID=460050002
There is no other thing Odon already has, though ....

ID=460050003
If Odon also has interest in such substances, at that time ... stop it!

ID=460050004
Huh ... why is it so detailed?

ID=460050005
......

ID=460050006
Do not do it! do not teach! I will not tell you!

ID=460050007
(The entrance of the trash box was closed with loud noise)

ID=260050501
I wonder what it might be dangerous, but I surely accomplish the request I received.\nThat's the secret to survive as a mercenary.

ID=260050502
If you do not have the ability, proceed without choosing the means and method.\nAs this is the case, I will ask you to accept my request.

ID=260050503
Destruction of Gatling gun which is the defense device inside N-102.\nI can avoid Seoul Junk somehow, but that Gatling cannon is not so.

ID=260050504
I will definitely not move unless I get close.\nHowever, it is hard to oppose machines that faithfully carry out only the duties given.

ID=260050505
If you are a reward, I'll prepare the best that I can do as usual.\n... Do not refuse?

ID=660050501
Was saved.\nApparently I seem to have caught an excellent mercenary.

ID=360050501
Destroy the Gatling gun inside the N - 102.

ID=560050501
It was a pain. With this you can enter inside with peace of mind.

ID=560050502
... I saw strange things in the laboratory.\nOver there Soul junk ... Although it seems that the original was a human being, it seems to be so, is it?

ID=560050503
......\nReally. I knew it.

ID=560050504
It is unbelievable. What experiments were done in the laboratory and what is happening ....\nThere are circumstances where closing his eyes, closing my ears and doing what I told you ....

ID=560050505
I am too late. As a mercenary for the Ned Company, I am going to work and get money\nFrom the moment you step in your foot ....

ID=560050506
But I do not want you to do so.\nLike me ... Do not become foolish adults whose eyes are dazzling and do not know what is right.

ID=460050501
It was a pain.\nWell then, I guarantee to be ready to earn again. See you!

ID=260051001
Code name "Beholda" ....\nIt's a perfect name for that figure with a huge eyeball.

ID=260051002
Beholda is a monster that appears in fantasy novels.\nIt seems that magic will be unusable in the place where that vision caught.

ID=260051003
Oh, that's magic ....\n... Oops, sorry. You have talked about idiots.

ID=260051004
Anyway, Biehourder's "eyes" are very impressive.\nIt was close to human eyes.

ID=260051005
... Hmm? By the way, there is no way to distinguish or the eye is human.\nIf you have time, will you bring me the eyeball cell of Beholda?

ID=660051001
I have to check it.\nThere is something to worry about ....

ID=660051002
I will take trouble but will you report to Leona again this time?

ID=360051001
I would like you to bring the eyeball cells of the bihold.

ID=560051001
It is the eyeball cell of Beholda. ...... I was curious about it before,\nHow do you get such a thing that is mucous and nuclear?

ID=560051002
... I see.\nThere was such a method, did not he?

ID=560051003
I will investigate this cell that you got with such a fantastic collection method.

ID=560051004
......

ID=560051005
... This is a human eye.\nThe structure is slightly different, but it resembles human eyes ... No, it is almost the same.

ID=560051006
... It is strange. Human cells should not enter at all when creating a bihold.\nBut why almost the same as human organs ...?

ID=560051007
And this eye cell ... a trace of evolution was found.\nFrom a simple soul junk ... to Seoul Junk with human eyes.

ID=560051008
... It is speculated that voluntary evolution has been achieved.\nImitate human organs that can be called natural enemies.

ID=560051009
It is a case different from Junk Knight.\nIt is totally different between soul junk infesting humans and bringing evolution itself closer to humans.

ID=560051010
......\nSomeday ... Soul junk that completely imitates human figure may appear.

ID=460051001
... Congratulations!\nIt seems that ... it will be impossible to turn it into open material.

ID=260051501
That researcher ....\nAs consciousness faded in the cocoon, I wonder what you thought ....

ID=260051502
family? A loved one? Or regret?

ID=260051503
... I do not understand. I really do not want to think about it.

ID=260051504
Poor ... I do not know if I can say that word ....\nBut ... to keep this ... ....

ID=260051505
Make them easy.\n... I'd like to return to where they should be.

ID=660051501
I do not know if it is hell or heaven ....\nAt least the place they should be is not over there.

ID=360051501
They have rest.\nRelease from suffering in the cocoon ....

ID=560051501
Thanks for your hard work. There are no wills from them ... you know.\n... I guess I was not human.

ID=460051501
Ok, then it's the last one.\nDo your best only once more.

ID=260052001
A researcher who turned into Seoul Junk halfway through the remaining person.\nThose who dyed their hands on inhumane experiments.

ID=260052002
The people of this time too ... The previous people can be said to be self-income too.\nBut since they are intelligent people, you should have assumed that there is a possibility of becoming such as well.

ID=260052003
I do not know if my eyes were dazzling or just interested.\nBut those who all have sad endings.

ID=260052004
In whatever form ... they follow their own will,\nIt is not just a soul junk or a human being, just roaming inside the laboratory ....\nI want them to be released.

ID=660052001
Only your last self esteem is protected by you.

ID=360052001
Code name "S - 00" They have a restful sleep ....

ID=560052001
You seem to have finished.

ID=560052002
Fuu ... Thank you very much.\n... You better rest a little.

ID=460052001
I am also a little rested.

ID=260052501
The accident is paid to the staff due to the accident in the laboratory.\nI'm sorry. I will correct. It is paid to the "family" of the staff.

ID=260052502
It was an accident that my chest hurts, but for the staff I have a responsibility until the end\nIt is part of the wonderful idea of ​​Ned Company.

ID=260052503
However, a minor trouble has occurred.\nThere is no way to prove their identity who is not already human.

ID=260052504
In other words, among the people who worked in the laboratory ....\nThere is no way to know who dies and survives.

ID=260052505
In response to this case the top of the Ned Company had all the internal\nWe decided that the person was dead, and decided to pay the benefits to the family.

ID=260052506
However, because the amount of bonus is amount, even those who were not in the laboratory on the day of the incident\nThere are many insurance money frauds that forge as if they were on duty.

ID=260052507
Therefore, those who worked in the laboratory need something to prove it.

ID=260052508
Everyone who worked at the laboratory has a facility entry permit.

ID=260052509
Please collect as many facility entrance permit as possible from within the laboratory.\nThe owner of the entrance permit is officially death processed from that moment and bonus is paid.

ID=260052510
There is no other way to respond to them who lost their lives because of Ned Company.\nIt is a miserable story, but it is also a fact.

ID=260052511
For those who are left behind, the bonus should be paid to the appropriate person firmly.\nWould you please accept this request?

ID=660052501
Thank you very much. We'll be expecting you.

ID=360052501
Please collect as many facility entrance permit as possible from within the laboratory.\nTo pay the owner a bonus.

ID=560052501
Many people gathered.\nWe will summarize the entrance permit information and report it to the top.

ID=460052501
Thank you very much.\nI hope this will be a comfort to their family even a little.

ID=260053001
Thanks to you, I was able to deliver the benefits successfully.\nOn behalf of the company we would like to thank you.

ID=260053002
However, another problem occurred.\nI confirmed the CCTV, and the number of people who worked at the time of the incident was fixed.

ID=260053003
It does not match the number of facility entrance permit.\nThe number of facility entrance permit is fewer than the number of workers.

ID=260053004
In the process of the accident, I estimate it was lost.\nIn other words, the number of families can not receive bonuses.

ID=260053005
When the incident occurred, at the time when all the identities of those who worked at the laboratory were grasped\nI have talked about collective payment of benefits to them.

ID=260053006
A controversy broke out here. Seoul Junk currently in the laboratory is based on humans.\nThe beginning of the controversy is that whatever the figure is, it is alive.

ID=260053007
In other words, even if it becomes Seoul Junk, it means that it is biologically alive.\nI can not send them a bonus.

ID=260053008
... The more prolonged this situation, the deeper the wounds of the bereaved.\nSo it will be a personal request.

ID=260053009
I would like you to handle all the soul junks in the laboratory.\nIf you do so, you will be able to pay as if everyone died.

ID=260053010
We decided that all the members died due to the collision between soul junks.\nI'm relieved as I have the ability and authority to that extent.

ID=660053001
Thank you very much. We'll be expecting you.

ID=360053001
Please handle all the soul junk in the laboratory.

ID=560053001
Thank you for your hard work.\nWith this, we can pay bonuses to all the bereaved families.

ID=460053001
... Thank you for accepting us, despite being very heart-warming content.\nIf there is another opportunity, thank you.

ID=260053501
long time no see.

ID=260053502
"Soul junk, who are they?" We shot is a broadcast ban.

ID=260053503
Huh ... can you believe it?\nA lot of coverage content and evidence, and all the data taken until my life was taken are all water bubbles.

ID=260053504
No, perhaps it might have been like this from the beginning.

ID=260053505
Although it can not be said clearly, there is a possibility that pressure has been put on broadcasting stations from Ned.\nIt is unusual to become a broadcast ban measure like this.

ID=260053506
This documentary related to the accident occurred in N - 102,\nIt would have been decided that it would be disadvantageous to them.

ID=260053507
Well, regrettable, but this is reality. It is not an era when diversified media remains like the old days.\nAt best, with broadcasting ... Well the newspaper? my mother.

ID=260053508
So I saw it on the news, monster in N - 102 ... Is it a guy made by Ned's experiment?

ID=260053509
There are contents we examined ... the monster that appeared in this time N-102 ....\nThere is somewhat disgusting feeling. Extraordinary things happen ... I feel like that.

ID=260053510
So what do you want to ask for privately?

ID=260053511
To be honest, I have no antipathy against Ned in this case.\nHowever, I care about having guys trying to conceal this.

ID=260053512
As a journalist, I want to know the truth about this time.\nSo, I'd like you to help me.

ID=260053513
That monster that was on the news ... was it a bihold?\nHe is a big one ....

ID=260053514
Well, anyway. If my acquaintance experts are going to investigate monsters\nDo not tell me to bring in the primitive 'something' of that monster.

ID=260053515
But, that "something" is special among those with different powers ....\nIn other words, it seems that it can only be retrieved by Seoul workers.

ID=260053516
There it is. My relationship with you is short,\nYou ... I was convinced that the dimensions had something different.

ID=260053517
Probably the special existence that I said earlier ... I think he is a soul worker.

ID=260053518
ask! Get the crystal of the monster!\nI want to stop Naruto's violence.

ID=660053501
To pay attention. Crystal ... is not it? Something similar to the heart of a monster. Ask him.\nThere should still be monsters in the deepest part of N - 102.

ID=360053501
Please hurry as much as possible. I do not know when Ned will sniff out.

ID=560053501
Is this ... monster crystal?

ID=560053502
What is that ... it is a creepy object.

ID=460053501
Well anyway, I decide to investigate this. Thanks!

ID=460053502
And, please keep it from now on!\nWhen this survey is over ... I may not be able to enter the broadcast station anymore.

ID=260054001
Well, I saw it! I saw it all!

ID=260054002
Oh, those guys ... I secretly hidden the laboratory eroded experiments!

ID=260054003
And, I have to stop! Oh, I have to stop their experiments!

ID=260054004
But, it is useless ...! I can not get out of here.

ID=260054005
That's right! You stop them! Then I am relieved!

ID=660054001
It's the second laboratory! I would like to know what kind of experiment I did.\nBring me the cells of the experimenter, Omae!\nWell then I will investigate!

ID=360054001
You should be in the second laboratory. Yeah, surely!\nBring me up with that cell! Well then I will investigate!

ID=560054001
(I placed the experimental cell sample in the trash box)

ID=560054002
Is this the experimental cell?

ID=460054001
Wrong. This was not made by their experiments!

ID=460054002
This is an experimental body made from things I experimented with.\nDifferent person ... Please find a different person!\nAs it is, they will start another experiment!

ID=460054003
But ... no ... There is no place to think now,\nWell, I'll call you again! !

ID=260055001
Here it is useless! I have to take another one ....

ID=260055002
Well, I still feel something is wrong! ... Oh, do you think so, do not you think so?

ID=260055003
... That's it! I bet it's over there!\nHere it is the last. Bottom level laboratory ... Go over there.

ID=260055004
Well, they should have done the last experiment ....\nBokura ... No, all the experiments were done there even when I was there.

ID=260055005
But, be careful ... unlike other laboratories, that is very dangerous ....

ID=660055001
It should be similar to the experimental body from which you obtained the cells.\nBring your cells out from them.

ID=360055001
Then, it's the lowest level laboratory ...! I do not know something, but ... I have a very dangerous smell!

ID=560055001
(I put the completed cell sample in the trash box)

ID=560055002
Is this the cell you got in the bottom layer laboratory ...?

ID=460055001
Here, this is fine.\nLater, I will check ... wait a moment!

ID=460055002
What is it ...! This is ... it is too late ... / /.\nIt is already finished up to this level ... already ...! !

ID=460055003
Ba and Vacuum Bain are so fused together ... until mass production ....\nBut, what kind of monsters are they trying to produce? What?

ID=460055004
I can not do it anymore ... I do not want to talk any more.\nI will not get out of here anymore. I will not see anyone ... I do not know the world any more ....

ID=460055005
Oh, they're going to produce monsters. Watch out yourself well.\nEveryone must get away from them ....

ID=460055006
(The entrance to the trash box was closed and it will not be opened anymore)

ID=260055501
You came a lot.

ID=260055502
I saw that flying monster and I remembered the person who was there long ago.

ID=260055503
Edwin Hayes ... I am a senior photographer and a famous man who was active as a journalist.

ID=260055504
It was a really amazing person.\n10 years from the blank ... I spent with soldiers on the battlefield and took a lot of pictures.

ID=260055505
For 10 years, while living the same life as a soldier, he came back alive properly.

ID=260055506
And they showed us many devastation and reality.\nIt was his influence that I became a photographer.

ID=260055507
But he eventually lost his life.\nI was attacked by Seoul Junk while traveling by plane ....

ID=260055508
We tried to search for the body of the victim, but his body was nowhere to be found.

ID=260055509
Eventually, I had no choice but to cry while looking at the coffin without him.\nThere were many people besides me. Cynthia is also.

ID=260055510
I first saw Cynthia when she was idle.\nAt that time I did not even have any interest.

ID=260055511
However, when she learned that her tears at the funeral home and herself quit idle and became a reporter,\nMy heart has changed. I thought that I wanted to become her photographer and light up the world.

ID=260055512
Broadcasters initially tried to send her to entertainment and the social department,\nShe rejected it all, and it was the battlefield that I chose.

ID=260055513
However, there were no cameramen going along like that.\nWell, that is why I volunteered.

ID=260055514
... You did a boring story. Anyway, we are here ... no,\nIt was the opportunity to become a reporter and photographer in this world.\nEdwin Hayes, he decided to become a journalist same as him.

ID=260055515
It's strange. I remember him only for today.

ID=260055516
%username%, May I ask you to do one ...?

ID=260055517
A monster who fly around that sky ... I do not want to see any more.\nI do not think I will remember him again. I want you to never fly around the sky again.

ID=660055501
I will not forget him. However, it is useless if it hinders work.\nThe camera shows the emotions of the photographer and the person being photographed.

ID=360055501
... What does Cynthia think of seeing that monster?

ID=560055501
Thank you.

ID=460055501
I asked Cynthia about that monster to see what I thought ....

ID=460055502
She said like this. "Gagher noisy bird". Cook's ....

ID=460055503
Apparently I seemed to be out of my mind.

ID=260056001
Ralph had said this before.\n"There is a regrettable thing about you, you are not feminine."

ID=260056002
I considered the intention of saying that she is not feminine.\nHowever, even if I think about it, I think that it is still the meaning as it is.

ID=260056003
It is that sex is a woman, but her personality is not like a woman.\nThinking carefully, it means that I said something very rude, did not I? Ralf is.

ID=260056004
But, I do not think I should deny this.\nIt is not too late from now, so I will try to polish femininity.

ID=260056005
As a result of retrieving information through the company intranet,\nIn the case of women, it was necessary to have "something" enough to surprise others.

ID=260056006
To that "something" it is necessary to have enough explosive power to skip the shirt button.\nIt is speculated that my femininity will be further corrected if there is only it.

ID=260056007
I tried to find out what it is, but I could not find the answer.\nSo, I came up with a thoughtful conclusion.

ID=260056008
In Seoul Junk, I heard that there are individuals to explode.\nI remember that it was the code name "Hokuma".

ID=260056009
Could you get the nucleus of Hokuma? That nucleus that can explode at any time,\nI think that it will produce the best power to polish femininity.

ID=660056001
Thank you very much. We'll be expecting you.

ID=660056002
(... I feel something wrong, but let's go for the time being)

ID=360056001
Please obtain the nucleus of the code name "Hokuma".\nI need something to explode.

ID=560056001
It seems that you got the thing you requested.

ID=560056002
... By the way ... how is it used correctly?\n... do you know?

ID=560056003
You do not seem to know .... I understand.\nI will ask Ralf.

ID=460056001
Thank you for your hard work.

ID=260056501
welcome!

ID=260056502
It was just right! Sorry for a moment!

ID=260056503
Hahah! Go for it! I think I will make a new product!

ID=260056504
As a matter of course the man is power! In other words, is it muscle spin?\nSo, I'd like to make something that makes my muscles prominent ....

ID=260056505
Although I got a design drawing and a certain amount of material with what I had on hand,\nThe main material of the bottom is out ....

ID=260056506
There is Seoul Junk with black wings,\nWill not you pick some of their crust shells?

ID=660056501
Thanks! In the meanwhile, I will prepare another!

ID=360056501
Are you still sitting? Here, it is a big cat with that wing.\nPlease get me the crust from him!

ID=560056501
Is the shellfish available?

ID=560056502
Well, this elasticity and tension, and shininess ... Wow, that is wonderful!

ID=460056501
Huh? What kind of project are you planning to make? Hahah! That's a secret! Hahahahah!

ID=260057001
... I tried to show the nucleus of Hokuma to Ralf, but it was laughed loudly.\nRalf who smiled so much saw it after a long time.

ID=260057002
I said that my intention was very good.\nHowever, I was told that there is no need to hurry because it is not yet such a stage.

ID=260057003
First of all, it seems good to start from a simple stage.\nRalph was saying, "A woman was saying goodbye."

ID=260057004
Nayonayo ... According to the dictionary, "It looks as if you are lightly shaking like the power has escaped".\nAs a result of considering what the true meaning of Ralph's words is ....

ID=260057005
I came to the conclusion that the wing of the codenamed "Ruga" is necessary.

ID=260057006
Ruga is a flight type soul junk,\nI decided that it has the wing which is closest to the dictionary meaning of Nayonayo.

ID=260057007
Please get the wings of Ruga.

ID=660057001
Thank you very much.\nWe'll be expecting you.

ID=660057002
(This time seems to be misunderstanding as well ... yet ... keep it silent)

ID=360057001
You need the wings of the codename "Ruga".

ID=560057001
Thank you for your hard work. It seems you got the thing you requested.

ID=560057002
If you show this to Ralf, you will know how to use it correctly.\nWith this, we can expect improvement of femininity.

ID=460057001
Thank you for your hard work.

ID=260057501
Oh,%username%! Something needed was made in a hurry!

ID=260057502
I'm making a prototype with crust shell I brought before.

ID=260057503
But the problem ... If I make it according to the design drawing, I feel a little comfortable.

ID=260057504
If you put in something that shines, you think that it will be much cooler.

ID=260057505
I'm looking for that "something\

ID=660057501
I think I'm thinking, but at the place where he got the crust,\nI guess I can get something else ....

ID=660057502
... and say something like that!

ID=360057501
Please hurry! Even decoration will become a masterpiece of the past,\nIt seems to be able to produce "muscle, muscle, muscle things"! Hahaha!

ID=560057501
Oh! This light body! !

ID=560057502
Supreme! Outstanding sense! I will start working immediately!

ID=560057503
Please wait a while!

ID=560057504
......

ID=560057505
...... (It seems it was completed)

ID=560057506
So, it was possible! What is it? What?

ID=560057507
Cubes that shine brilliantly in this cross line!\nWhat is perfect like this for the first time in life!

ID=460057501
Huh? Something? Deep and dark ... Doubtful people seem to like it?

ID=460057502
......

ID=460057503
Different! That's not it!\nJust because I want to show pure muscle beautifully ....

ID=460057504
Wow ... Jight was such a character ...?

ID=460057505
What kind of thing is that kind of character! What?

ID=460057506
Well, no, no ... nothing! Well, see you!

ID=460057507
Hey kola! Yomi! Ooooo!

ID=460057508
This guy ... It sounds like a mistake.

ID=260058001
Dignity snatcher .... I went into the inside of the transport machine.\nAccording to Henry, talk about the fact that the Dignity Snutcher is a thorough parasite.

ID=260058002
Parasitic on people with Seoul Energy, experts and soul workers,\nI pierced my tentacles.

ID=260058003
It seems that Soul Energy is absorbed by its tentacle to make it a power source.\nYou use humans as an auxiliary battery.

ID=260058004
There will be a difference in power depending on the soul energy amount of the parasitic human being.\nIf you parasitize an excellent soul worker, there are cases where you evolve into a waking body.

ID=260058005
... Improve the vacuum vane and even use Seoul Energy as a power source\nTo make soul junk ... .... Guys at Ned, what are you going to do?

ID=260058006
Moreover, it seems that there is not only one type of Dignity Snatcher.\nEven 3 types of just confirmed type. ... There may be more.

ID=260058007
Anyway, I can not let go of the guy.\nTo use a human being as an auxiliary battery, it is the extreme of the people.

ID=260058008
Treat it before a new victim comes out.

ID=660058001
What made by human being parasitizes and exploits humans ...?\nIt seems like it will come out in science fiction novels too.

ID=360058001
Dignity Snatcher. Defeat him.

ID=560058001
Apparently I got it.

ID=560058002
After all, it seems that there will be no power without an auxiliary battery.\nI wonder if it was okay to keep the lead.

ID=460058001
I just hope not to be infested by soul workers and different people.\nIf that is the case, the situation will be more serious.

ID=260058501
%username%! I, what should I do?

ID=260058502
Why is there a weird problem only in my place?

ID=260058503
What do you think happened this time?

ID=260058504
It was about the night, but when I finished gathering and went back home.\nFrom the window of my room, I saw that something went out!

ID=260058505
I hurried home, but ... the clothes messed up messed up ....\nWell, if you look closely it is not enough for some!

ID=260058506
Huh ... I do not want it anymore!

ID=260058507
To the unidentified monster following the spider ... What should I do ...?

ID=660058501
Anyway, catch the perpetrator and find clothes too!\nHuh ... I hope my clothes are safe.

ID=360058501
Anyway, find it!\nI do not know for sure, but he was like a spider!

ID=560058501
there were?

ID=460058501
Here, this is my clothes! What? Ba, they are not apart.

ID=460058502
Huh ... after all it will be like this.

ID=460058503
... Thanks. I am exhausted. I wonder to return to Grace City ...?

ID=260059001
Oh, hey! Have you ever heard of rumors that a white monster appears recently?

ID=260059002
You still have it! It was just right.\nWill you get the crust of that monster?

ID=260059003
Recently, I found something in the black market,\nI can not get it for a moment. It's soft and cute but it's rising ....

ID=260059004
I'd like you to pick up the white shellfish there.\nHow? Could you please?

ID=260059005
Well, that's not unusual, but I think many people think it is unusual.\nWhite shell shell. I never saw it in the market, so I think I can make a profit.

ID=260059006
If you get it, you will also get rewards?

ID=260059007
Huh? What on earth is it useful for?

ID=260059008
Well ... I will tell you if I can get it. I understood?

ID=660059001
Huh ... Well then, I'm expecting you. Hurry up!

ID=360059001
What's wrong?\nNo way ... Is not it scary?

ID=560059001
It was late.

ID=560059002
Well, this is the shell of a white monster ...?\nCrust that shines pure white without scratches ... Good.

ID=460059001
This is surely ... yeah. Thanks dear!

ID=460059002
what? I have less reward than I thought?

ID=460059003
Do you not think that the values ​​differ from person to person?

ID=460059004
Anyway, thanks ♡

ID=260059501
long time no see. %username%.

ID=260059502
There is something I'd like to ask.

ID=260059503
It is a flying monster that recently appeared. Since there is a protective wall, I will not enter,\nDue to the flying around all the time, the number of people who are worried is increasing.

ID=260059504
There is no direct attack yet,\nHowever, I can not leave it as it is.

ID=260059505
Could you please get rid of that monster?

ID=660059501
It is a monster whose wings are growing like a snake! Please!

ID=360059501
Why on earth are you flying over there ...?\nI do not know what you are thinking, but I can not leave it alone. Please.

ID=560059501
Thank you for your hard work!

ID=460059501
As expected, it is one word of truth. Thank you very much.

ID=460059502
It will not be completely, but this will have no effect.

ID=260060001
It is serious!

ID=260060002
Another monster outside the city\nI heard that some people saw that they appeared.

ID=260060003
Probably the last monster ceased to exist, so new monsters would have gathered.

ID=260060004
Although there is no sign of coming in, it seems that a material transportation vehicle was attacked a while ago.\nIt is presumably due to that monster.

ID=660060001
You alone can depend on it. Thank you.

ID=360060001
is there something wrong?\nThere is a danger that supplies will run short as it is.

ID=560060001
Oh, you killed that monster.

ID=460060001
Thank you very much. I am sure that everyone will be grateful.

ID=460060002
I have never attacked so far ... why on earth?

ID=260060501
Ah, I came.

ID=260060502
Do you even see me as a selfish girl with only money in mind?

ID=260060503
Before this, you said a witch obsessed with money.\nWell, there is nothing to say about it.

ID=260060504
But ne ... I am making money for this city.

ID=260060505
......

ID=260060506
You ... do not believe it, right? Huh ... well. It's as expected.

ID=260060507
Do you know what you need most to survive in harsh environments?

ID=260060508
That 's power.\nEven if I say power there are various. "Power" "Wealth" "Military force ...".

ID=260060509
Among them, which force can I get easily?

ID=260060510
power? I do not have any connoons or acquaintances? Impossible.

ID=260060511
Military force? Certainly in this age, different people can live a blessed life.\nBut I am different. Even a spoon can not be bent by your own power.

ID=260060512
Then what can I do?

ID=260060513
All I have left is to make money.\nMoney ... Simple but you can make people cry and make people laugh.

ID=260060514
Even life is also affected, simple things but deep things.\nOnly that terrible existence was the only power left to me.

ID=260060515
So I started making money.\nIt worked better than I expected. Well that means "I turned".

ID=260060516
Anyway, earning money and doing so for 20 years ... I came back here as my hometown.

ID=260060517
But, when you come back,\nIt was not the city I knew.

ID=260060518
Soldiers and super-mega companies that I have never seen before. And the monster is wrinkled.

ID=260060519
The sky was overflowing with monsters ....

ID=260060520
I only want to regain the beautiful appearance of this city once more.\nEven if the way is different from Robert, the desire to rebuild this city is the same.

ID=260060521
Well, anyway.\nIf you talk to you like this, the eyes that see me around me will change a bit.

ID=260060522
And ....

ID=260060523
Gagyaghaaa!

ID=260060524
So ....

ID=260060525
Kiki Kiki 's Keegae!

ID=260060526
......

ID=260060527
Kukyakakya! !

ID=260060528
That monster! I wonder why it's limited to today!\nMegumu, the rest!

ID=260060529
Silence those monsters right now! Please do not shout again!

ID=660060501
I wonder what it is ... Fuu. I will ask for every single one.

ID=360060501
I wonder if you have heard my story? I'm leaving that monster!

ID=360060502
Not a single one!

ID=560060501
Did it finish?

ID=560060502
Kikyakakyakuaaaaa!

ID=460060501
... That's the limit. I wonder if there were too many numbers in order to be alone.\nHowever, I can not even let go of that one ....

ID=460060502
Good job.

ID=260062001
I can not keep them as they are, so I talked to Block.

ID=260062002
Ai they do not get anything stronger than myself.\nSo, if you have "something" that they fear, you can easily scare away them.

ID=260062003
I asked the block, but to the back of the shelter where Gals came out\nIt seems that there is an iron breaker and he is afraid of him.

ID=260062004
So this time, please come look for that wing feather.\nIf you hang it at a high place of Kandas city,\nGusels who noticed escape.

ID=660062001
Haa, I will be careful with various things. Completely ....\nAnyway, be sure to get it.

ID=360062001
Deep inside the shelter. I do not want to hear their voices any more. Please, thanks.

ID=560062001
Did you get feathers?

ID=560062002
Oh, it's bigger than I thought ....\nWell, you can see it even from afar as it is big.

ID=460062001
Well done. If you hang this on the building after that, that monster will also disappear.

ID=460062002
Thank you for everything moving!

ID=460062003
When I first saw you, I thought that it was the same as other people.\nIt is an ordinary person who sees only my appearance and money.

ID=460062004
Nowadays, money has been only a means for me.

ID=460062005
First to survive, and now to regain home.

ID=460062006
I heard that you solved various problems here while you helped me.

ID=460062007
After all, there are as many as "hero" called.

ID=460062008
But I wonder if I should advise you like that.

ID=460062009
Someday, the day will come when the limit comes.\nThat limit creates pain and setback that exceeds your imagination ....

ID=460062010
And, looking at such you, people around will go away.

ID=460062011
At that time, you have to choose.

ID=460062012
Among all condemns and contempts, will you be silent guardians who silently protect them ...?

ID=460062013
Or ....

ID=460062014
Cursed the light in the darkness, will it become a revenger who pledges revenge in the shadow ...?

ID=460062015
It will not be a distant future story when you choose. Surely immediately ....

ID=460062016
That blue sky will not come back yet, but someday everything will be over, the day will come.

ID=460062017
Thank you so far.

ID=210035001
My name is Toll.\nHere is the temporary commander of the Star Forest Alliance, stationed in Grace City.

ID=210035002
In this battle the commander here was able to achieve a spectacular end ....\nIt is regrettable.

ID=210035003
Even if I regret, I can not regret it ....\nWe will only make further efforts so that we do not destroy that sacrifice.

ID=210035004
Look up at the sky.\nDoes not your resemblance to the sky that you looked up before the blank?

ID=210035005
This blue sky is a pride and symbol of Grace City.\nAfter the blank, the blue sky that I looked up like a matter of course was very valuable.

ID=210035006
To protect this blue sky ... That is our mission.

ID=210035007
...... Kuu ....\nIf you think promptly, is not it quite possible?\nI have to make a note ....

ID=210035008
Do not hesitate to post your memo.\nFamous words are vitality of the mind. ... Oops, I've also born quotes.

ID=210035009
You are listening to stories from Colonel Aaron.\nA person named Henry got it in Seoul Junk experiment\nDid you scratch the Kandas city ...?

ID=210035010
In that process, it seems that the daughter of Colonel Aaron has died.\nWhat a painful thing.

ID=210035011
It certainly should condemn the guy and let this responsibility be chased.\nHowever ....

ID=210035012
There is no firm evidence.\nOnce it is pushed down because it is a radical rumor, it is until then ....

ID=210035013
So ... I would like you to grasp the evidence.\nProve that Ned Company can not escape.

ID=210035014
I will not spare support.\nHowever, to the last "unofficial" ....

ID=210035015
Currently, the Ned Company and the Star Forest Alliance\nIt is closely related to the alliance outside.\nIf it turns out that we actively supported your assurance of your evidence ....

ID=210035016
I will call a big ripple in every place.\nThe discord between the Star Forest Alliance and Ned Company appears at a stroke.

ID=210035017
The explanation is over.\nWe will not spare any support such as methods and information. However, although it is informally ....

ID=210035018
Think of it as a detective who was requested by a certain man who doubts the behavior of his wife.

ID=210035019
This case has already been reported to our army in Grace City.\nWell, it would be better to know about each other's face and name.\nWhy do not you come around greetings as well?

ID=210035020
It is new. Thank you!\nI do not understand anything! I'm a fool!\n... It will not be a problem if you say it.

ID=210035021
Who will first visit your office ....\nColonel Hyp.

ID=610035001
It is like a feeling that made Anpan a hero of justice.\nGo and say hello.

ID=310035001
Colonel Hyp is in some way not suitable for soldiers.

ID=100350101
Oh, you were talking about Aaron ....\nI have heard the story.

ID=100350102
I am hype.\nHe is the commander of the stationary forest coalition being stationed.

ID=100350103
However, due to injuries now,\nI temporarily deposit the command with Toll.

ID=100350104
... Hmm? A former commander scattered spectacularly on the battlefield ...?\nDid Tall say so?

ID=100350105
...... Tell me when you see Toll.\nJust like to refrain from laughable jokes ... and.

ID=100350106
From the old days Tall's man is trying to keep me away from the battlefield.\nNo, it's not a bad meaning ....

ID=100350107
I am also old. I gradually stop listening to my body.\n... It might be a time of tide as a soldier.

ID=100350108
He is concerned about me ....

ID=100350109
But ... there are people who can not leave it alone ....\nThose who have guarded their lives and protected this town.

ID=100350110
Elders have been told that young people entrust everything to leave.\nI will agree with that.

ID=100350111
But that is not the case now. Even one person now needs a lot of staff now.\nEven such a senior citizen ... It will be about everyone's refuge.\nHa ha ha!

ID=100350112
Well, let's have a dark story about this ....\nLet's boast about this Grace City boast a bit.

ID=100350113
Grace City, as its name says, "City of grace" ....\nIt is not only rich in nature but also the center of the western part of Crow Dream.

ID=100350114
It is the largest and among the cities built after the blanks, it is a very important base.\nOf course there are military implications, but the point that citizens can live in peace is big.

ID=100350115
Grace City has never allowed the invasion of other powers even once.\nRapid Flame, as well as Seoul Junk.

ID=100350116
Yes, this is a city with steel walls ....\nTake a look. A peaceful smile of everyone ....

ID=100350117
That is the symbol of peace.\nThis is ... the pride we built up.

ID=100350118
I do not know the details ... what you do here.\nBut just remember one thing.

ID=100350119
That you are a member who keeps peace ....

ID=100350120
Hahaha, what kind. It takes a long time to preach on taking the age.\nIt seems that I got too much trouble.

ID=100350121
You may want to visit Captain Senior.\nHe is a talented person who has been assigned a strategy officer in Grace City.

ID=100350201
A newcomer you are talking about by Thor commander?\nHmmm ... Soul worker.\nI do not see it looking too strong.

ID=100350202
I am Senior.\nI am assigned a strategy officer here.

ID=100350203
Are you looking for Henry?\nHenry is ... who did terrible things to the daughter of Aaron?

ID=100350204
There are witnesses and testimonies. But there is no definitive proof ....\nFuu, I can not do it.

ID=100350205
It was wrong from the beginning.\nAlthough it is for dealings, it is to destroy all the materials ....\nI can not believe it was somehow.

ID=100350206
I hope behind the scenes.\nI can not believe I will destroy important documents.

ID=100350207
Even if a person is too good ... Lieutenant Colonel Aaron.\nWhat was the block doing?\nI have been acting together for such a time ....

ID=100350208
Huh? block? Oh, it's a student of military school.\nType to personality ... Well, it looked like me.

ID=100350209
However, it was not an excellent one.\nThis failure is a good example.

ID=100350210
Oh yeah, I think I heard from the commander,\nOur support is "unofficial" to the last.\nDo not talk in other places. Good?

ID=100350211
That's over from me.\nAfter that ... There is a person to introduce to you.

ID=100350212
Please say hello to the maid man in the other side.\nI'll be waiting for you.

ID=100350213
His name is Kane Barrel.\nAlthough it may be a bit scary,\nIn other words I am your senior. Come here, please.

ID=510035001
... you?\nA new comment that comes from Kandusity ... ....

ID=410035001
It's Kane Barrel.

ID=210035501
... What?\nDo you feel something from me?

ID=210035502
Then remember that discomfort well.\nThat is the wavelength unique to soul workers.

ID=210035503
Yes, I am the same soul worker as you.\nWake up from the blank ... It's been five years already?

ID=210035504
Recently I have hardly seen soul workers,\nOne person was placed in the company five years ago.

ID=210035505
However, with "one case" as the boundary, a lot of breath came out and it became missing.\n... I am the one who survived luckily.

ID=210035506
Soul worker like you is the first time.\nWhat kind of fight have you been up to now ... almost imaginable.

ID=210035507
I do not intend to blow seniors,\nIf there is something to worry about, ask me anything. Okay?

ID=210035508
... I have not seen a soul worker after a long time.

ID=210035509
Your Oh?

ID=210035510
......?\nIs it Jeremy? What is it for here?

ID=210035511
Your Oh?\nOhhhhhhhhhh! ! !

ID=210035512
... Please speak.

ID=210035513
Ke, Keinbarrel Colonel!\nAnd the next door is no way ...! What?

ID=210035514
If you know, do not ask me.

ID=210035515
And after all ...!\nIt is an honor to meet you! I am Jeremy!

ID=210035516
Shu, my hobby is drawing pictures ...! Special skill is cooking under full military condition!\nMy favorite type is long hair, with a beautiful heart that wraps around ... / /.

ID=210035517
Well ... I'm confused.

ID=210035518
Jeremy. I'm asking what it is for.

ID=210035519
Oh, I'm sorry! I came here to receive the menu plate by Dr. Sedulin!\nWell, that's why ... if you have time ...!

ID=210035520
... I can not help it.

ID=210035521
Take away your work quickly.\nYou will be taken to Emilito again?

ID=210035522
Oh, yes!\nSo you'll excuse me! !

ID=210035523
When I have finished talking, let me go there.\nIs that okay?

ID=210035524
Oh, thank you!\nWell, see you later!

ID=210035525
(Jeremy ran with banging.\nLet your legs tangle and fall, but do not pretend to look)

ID=210035526
... It is a restless person at all.

ID=210035527
He is Jeremy.\nIt is in charge of the operation support unit's supply.

ID=210035528
... I feel a little calm, but a good guy.\nSerious and responsible feeling is more than one person.

ID=210035529
It seems I was waiting for you or I am coming for you.\nIt seems that you became a fan when you heard of your battle.

ID=210035530
Go ahead quickly.\nThe story is over.

ID=610035501
... I will see you next on the battlefield.

ID=310035501
Go to Jeremy.\n... I wish I had enough time to deal with this area.

ID=100355101
Oh ... oh! What?\nWell, it came true!

ID=100355102
D, Emilito!\nReally came! !

ID=100355103
... Jeremy, a little calm.\nYou are in trouble.

ID=100355104
I'm sorry.\nIt is Emilito who is in charge of the operation support troop replenishment.

ID=100355105
It is Jeremy belonging to the same unit!\nThank you! !

ID=100355106
Jeremy is insistent to see you ....\nEvery time a different person comes in this way. Whew ... ....

ID=100355107
No! This person is not just a different person!\nIt's a soul worker! Soul worker!

ID=100355108
... Please do not give out loud.\nThe information of the soul worker is confidential?

ID=100355109
Oh ... sorry ....

ID=100355110
... I'm sorry.\nI am still a child, I feel restless.

ID=100355111
To tell the truth, I also wanted to see you.\nPresence with special abilities is our longing.

ID=100355112
Its appearance that uses power that exceeds human knowledge for the world ....\nDue to the area that has drawn a line with us ....

ID=100355113
Emilito! Let's have a difficult story later ....\nLet's also listen to the battle at Kandas city!

ID=100355114
Hey, Jeremy.\nIs not there such time?

ID=100355115
Well, but now ...! !

ID=100355116
excuse me.\nI would like to talk to you, but even in my spare time ....

ID=100355117
Oh yeah, Tall commander was looking for it.\nIt seems like a mission.

ID=100355118
Then, the battle is on the next occasion again.

ID=100355119
Let me see ...! What? It is over! What?\nEven more, the story ...! Hey!

ID=100355120
Menu plate received from Dr. Sedulin,\nDid you finish writing the list and reporting it?

ID=100355121
Well ... but not yet.

ID=100355122
People have something to do.\nLet's listen slowly for the next opportunity.

ID=100355123
... Huh, I understand.

ID=100355124
Well then, I am looking forward to seeing you next time.\nbe careful.

ID=510035501
It seems that he greeted himself well.

ID=410035501
Let's give your duties to you from this.

ID=210036001
Before that, I will give you a special lecture on the lack of knowledge.\nIt concerns the existence of a different world called Vesh.

ID=210036002
Currently there are two disasters in Crow Dream.\nSoul junk, and Vesi ... these two.

ID=210036003
Vesi is a life form with intelligence,\nIt deals with the same language as humans, and looks like human beings alike.

ID=210036004
As a young man who is actively making gorgeous cosplay at first glance\nThere is no doubt if it is said.

ID=210036005
Vesi is a word that refers to a kind of race.\nAnd now it has confirmed that there are four forces in that tribe.

ID=210036006
It is unclear what relationship it is with each other. There is also possibility of completely irrelevant.\nHowever, because the wavelengths of emitted energy are the same,\nI just define them as Vesi.

ID=210036007
Their forces are the next four.\nHappy Meditation, RSB, Nihil Kingdom ....

ID=210036008
And it is the main enemy "Rapid Flame" in the western part of Crow Dream.

ID=210036009
Each of the power of Vesi has its own characteristics.\nLet me explain Rapid Flame this time.

ID=210036010
Vesi, the size of Desire (Desire) is directly linked to the strength of power.\nIt closely resembles a person with different power who uses the power of the mind and a soul worker.

ID=210036011
Rapid Flame's designer is "power."\nThat's it.

ID=210036012
Desire to become strong ... desire to reign above people.\nThat designer (desire) linked directly to power is the source of their power.

ID=210036013
This is also deeply involved with their temperament.\nRapid Flame's Vesi is generally very militant and ferocious.

ID=210036014
Currently, Grace City is fighting with Rapid Flame,\nYou will not be able to avoid them, even if you are looking for Henry here.

ID=210036015
So I will give your duty to you.

ID=210036016
Battle with Rapid Flame and get experience first.

ID=210036017
I know I do not have time.\nHowever, he will follow Henry and go around here and there.

ID=210036018
At that time, battle with Rapid Flame also inevitably occurs.\nIn case of battle with the coming Vesi, there is no loss after experiencing before.

ID=210036019
Henry's investigation takes time.\nWe can not waste 1 minute 1 second.

ID=210036020
You seem to understand?\nThen, please get it started soon.

ID=610036001
Named "first experience" plan.\nWell, it's quite nice.

ID=610036002
The target is a highway commander, codename "Black Gauntlet".\nYou can not fight if your hungry goes down. You should eat udon at resting places.

ID=310036001
Attack Rapid Flame on the highway!\nLet me say guys and gangs!

ID=510036001
well done. My arm does not look bad.

ID=410036001
However, there is a word "to hurry things in a hurry".

ID=210036501
... I can not afford the expression.\nWith this you can not do anything.

ID=210036502
You'd better cool your head a bit.\nWhy do not you come around again?

ID=210036503
You can meet Seduhrin.\nThen, how about trying to talk about other people?

ID=610036501
Head calmly, chest hot.\nIt is the basis of tactics.

ID=610036502
Cool your head as you go around Grace City.

ID=310036501
I'm going to Sedulin.\nCool your head a while walking ....

ID=100365101
Fuh ya ~.

ID=100365102
Oh, that's new! You are rumored ....

ID=100365103
I am Seduline.\nHe is a doctor. Thanks ~.

ID=100365104
You are told that you are often a childish face.\nLooking like this, the scuffle got caught pretty well?

ID=100365105
He is the principal doctor of the weapons research and development department 'ST Lab'.\nI am often surprised that "Do you know such a child?\nActually, it is a 30th woman, is not she?

ID=100365106
Fuh ya ~. I feel sleepy ....\nOh, what was it for? Soul Weapon is not my responsibility.

ID=100365107
What? The commander has been told me ~?\nWhy?

ID=100365108
Cool your head ~?\nHmmm ... was it something to do with it?

ID=100365109
Sake is the best at such times.\nI try to drink until my head is calico.\nI will forget my beautiful Sappari ~?

ID=100365110
This is a stress divergence method for me and seniors, though.\nGrace City has only a fine sake, so I do not have a hangover.

ID=100365111
Oh yeah, Grace City is blessed with goods?\nThat is thanks to the millionaire who is nabe.

ID=100365112
I do not know where the money comes from,\nHey ~~~ I am rich ~.

ID=100365113
All our necessities are supplied by Mr. Nabe ~.\nBecause I can not participate in battle, I want to support on the supply side ~.

ID=100365114
Because Mr. Nave is not very strong body ~.\nWe've taken a number of people and is on guarding.\nTry to talk even when it is not free.

ID=100365115
Fuh ya ~. I'm useless ... I already sleep ....\nIt's been a long time since I talked to people, so I talked a little bit ....

ID=100365116
I want to see even a dream to catch a rich man ~.\nWell then, good night ~.

ID=510036501
you are ...?

ID=410036501
my mother. I see.\nYou are rumored ....

ID=410036502
I'm honoured to be able to meet you.\nI am Nabe.

ID=210037001
I've also heard about your activity at Loco Town and Canduscity.\nI thought that I would like to see you someday.

ID=210037002
Sorry for the frustrating appearance.\nLong ago, I had an accident ... I hope you will understand.

ID=210037003
This is Roy who was dispatched from Starry Forest Union ....\nI am doing my help and guarding.\nTo be honest, I feel sorry to have you done so far ....

ID=210037004
I do not need to feel sorry otherwise.\nIt is not surprising that the Star Forest Coalition escorts you.

ID=210037005
Because I am supporting astronomical amount every month ....\nCould you give me a little too?

ID=210037006
... Can not do that. I have only money,\nThis should be used for the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=210037007
Well, unlike what it looks like, it is not easy.\nBut I like that kind of place. Ahaha.

ID=210037008
Haha, thank you.

ID=210037009
As you hear, this body can not be any fighting force ....\nHowever, I would like to support the coalition to the extent I can do.

ID=210037010
In the form of using the property we got from my father in a meaningful way ....\nI wish I had extraordinary abilities ....

ID=210037011
If I do not do anything, my property will be meaninglessly reduced.\nIf you serve us for humanity, we will not be lucky.

ID=210037012
Wow ...! George! Goh!\n... Fu ....

ID=210037013
... Excuse me.\nBecause I talked for a long time to a long time ....

ID=210037014
Oh my, please do more body.\nYou are an important money of the Starry Forest Union ...\nOops, it's a sponsor.

ID=210037015
... It is a thankfulness, Roy.

ID=210037016
Mr. Nave may not be able to speak any more.\nWould you like to talk to me?

ID=100370101
Oh ... It is a truth.\nJust being in the same space, this intimidation ....

ID=100370102
The black fire dragon that I lived in my left arm whispers.\n"He is not just a guy ..."

ID=100370103
I am also a qualified person for the first time, but I am lacking in real power.

ID=100370104
So, I also take care of Mr. Nave.\nI am not busy, but I often use a lot of mind ....

ID=100370105
......

ID=100370106
Oops it ruinsed.\nI do not care about Mr. Nabe separately.

ID=100370107
... Hahaha, I know.\nDo not mind ....

ID=100370108
Talking only here, I also suffer from some sickness.\nTherefore, it is not suitable for long-term strategy ....

ID=100370109
No, it is not a pessimistic translation.\nIn this way, I feel wary of the job of saving my life.

ID=100370110
Someday I want to join you on the battlefield.\nI've heard rumors, but I really would like to see that power.

ID=100370111
Oops, you should not take too much time.\nLet's talk the next opportunity.

ID=100370112
be careful ....

ID=510037001
It was just right.

ID=510037002
Good news.

ID=410037001
I understood Henry's whereabouts.

ID=210037501
A vehicle that Henry was supposed to have was discovered.\nIt's made by Ned Company, but the number matched that of Henry.

ID=210037502
It seems that it is now isolated on the expressway ....\nBut it is slightly strange.

ID=210037503
First of all, Henry took a helicopter to leave Kandathusity, did not he?\nNevertheless, it was cars that were discovered ....

ID=210037504
Then, why the highway? That's it.

ID=210037505
Even though Rapid Flame's guys are doing well,\nThere is a car that is made by the Ned Company is outstanding ....\nIt is strange what you think.

ID=210037506
Totally! It's too funny!\nBecause it is so funny, it is strange that you can see hallucinations of strange sweets!

ID=210037507
Commander ... Please read the air.\nAnyway, the suspicious smell gets fucked hard.

ID=210037508
But there is no other way.\nEven if it is suspicious information, I have no choice but to go.

ID=210037509
Even though I know it is a trap, there are times when I have to jump in.\nYou understand?

ID=610037501
If you can prepare, please depart.

ID=610037502
And also ... not to be dominated by emotions.\nWill you be in trouble if you lose reason?

ID=310037501
Go to the highway and investigate the car of the Ned Company.\nI am aware of the danger but I can not help it.

ID=510037501
Hmm, you ... you seemed to be frustrated.

ID=510037502
Well, it will not be interesting even if all the world's way you want it?\nEveryone has a reality that is not what they want.

ID=510037503
Commander ... It is not comforting at all.

ID=510037504
Although I went all the way it was a waste, I was annoyed! Ha ha ha!

ID=510037505
Toll commander ... .... (It has a terrible intimidation feeling ... ...)

ID=410037501
I'm sorry. However, there was no harvest at all.\nYou got the USB.

ID=210038001
The contents of USB were reports of codename "Amaryllis" ....\nOther contents are also included, but it is locked.

ID=210038002
We plan to mobilize all the hackers belonging to the Union to proceed.\nIt will get some results soon.\nMeanwhile, Kiki heads to the highway again.

ID=210038003
The codename "Scar" appeared.

ID=210038004
Scar is captain of the attacking section of Rapid Flame ....\nIt is our counterpart on our highway.

ID=210038005
I do not want to bake my hands ....\nKuku ... If you do such a thing, is not it hot? !

ID=210038006
It is a rare person who does not appear, but thanks to you being rampant.\nThis opportunity, I can not absolutely miss it ...!

ID=210038007
I know how to be impatient. But wait now.\nWe are not playing around. You should be able to hear good news.

ID=210038008
It's boring ... Playfulness is important.\nI have plenty of time.

ID=210038009
Originally you should let Kane Barrel go ....\nHe is out now. So you will have me go.

ID=210038010
What! Was Kane Barrel going out again again?

ID=210038011
...... When we are talking seriously,\nCould you refrain from joke too?

ID=210038012
Next. There is no character of "patience" in our dictionary.

ID=210038013
... Let's talk later.\nAnyway, it's your job to repel Scar.\nAnd that is our wish for the Starry Forest Alliance.

ID=610038001
I will tell you, but usually I'm not an opponent to leave it to newcomers.\nBut if you ....

ID=610038002
Sending a subordinate to the dead ground ...!\nWhat a cruel superior!

ID=610038003
I will be exercising your ability soon?

ID=310038001
I am punishing the codename "Scar".\nA tough opponent ... Do not get stuck.

ID=100380201
I heard he has defeated Scar!\nGreat! You are the true soul worker!

ID=100380202
But it seems that Scar fell off the bridge?\nHmm, it is about a guy ... Maybe it will show up again.

ID=100380203
It is not manga ... I'm fine, I bet.

ID=100380204
Well, Senior.\nManga is based on facts.

ID=100380205
... Really?

ID=100380206
While you are fighting Scar,\nWe were hacking the Ned Company's USB ....\nIt ended in failure.

ID=100380207
A high level of security lock was applied.\nIf you are a Ned Company person, we can not do anything.

ID=100380208
However, it is unavoidable that this is the case.\nYou will exchange directly with Ned Company.\nYour guard goes to Emilito.

ID=100380209
Emilito is a childhood friend with the secretary of Ned Company.\nIn other words, letting the two misunderstand, to the bottom of the abyss never to return.

ID=100380210
Ah Yes. Please listen to this person's story in half of the story.\nYour task is to contact Ned Company secretary 'Rafer.'\nThat way we can only look for their cooperation.

ID=100380211
There is only one way this is now. ... I asked.

ID=100380212
Well then, I went to the place of Emilito.\nDoes it properly explain?

ID=100380213
Okay! What?\nTear the two of them to shreds!

ID=100380214
You said you did not say strange things! ! This stupid commander! !

ID=510038001
What happened?

ID=410038001
... to introduce Laufa?

ID=210038501
Ned Company's USB needs to be connected to a specific device to unlock it.\nSo, I touched Laufa and got a device ... is not it?

ID=210038502
There is one thing I want to tell you.

ID=210038503
Rafer and I are childhood friend.\nHowever, due to differences in thinking, Rafer is a Ned Company,\nI applied for the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=210038504
I volunteered in two completely conflicting groups.\nHowever, I came without touching each other about this matter.

ID=210038505
That means that we understand each other and respect each other.\nThis case will surely help you if I ask for loafers.

ID=210038506
No matter where Laufa is placed ....\nIt is such a relationship. Me and Rafer are ....

ID=210038507
So, why should I ask you to do it lightly ... I'm lost.\nOmnibus is a request for support, but if you turn backwards it means you betray Ned Company?

ID=210038508
But, Emilito. The Ned Company is a bad guy, right?\nRafer also seems familiar with that area ....\nTo be honest, what is it supposed to be ...?

ID=210038509
... Jeremy, that is not such a simple story.

ID=210038510
So what do you do?

ID=210038511
Everyone's different from people's values.\nFor Rafer, Ned Company is justice,\nThe Star Forest Alliance may be the opposite.

ID=210038512
What are you talking about!\nNed company is wrong ... I can understand even in monkeys!

ID=210038513
That is what we call our values.\nTo you ... it was still a bit difficult story.

ID=210038514
What? What?

ID=210038515
Fuu ....\n... I am lost, there is only one choice.

ID=610038501
Let's go to Laufa.\nI will join you as well.

ID=310038502
Let's go to Laufa.\nI will accompany you.

ID=100385101
This is Ned Company secretary chief Laufer.\nDo you need something?

ID=100385102
Lauffer.

ID=100385103
Hmm? Emilito? What happened?\nIt should not be off duty today.

ID=100385104
There was asking for ....

ID=100385105
... ... Tell me.

ID=100385106
(Emilite asked me to lend a device to unlock USB)

ID=100385107
......

ID=100385108
To say that it is impossible trust is hundreds of things ....\nBut, it is important.

ID=100385109
If your feelings of feeling ... Ned Company is real ...\nYour role is to eliminate the stains on the tissue ... will not it?

ID=100385110
... I see.\nI thought something was wrong.

ID=100385111
...?\nDid something happen?

ID=100385112
To tell the truth, during this time Henry attended.

ID=100385113
! !\nHenry is ...?

ID=100385114
It was two days ago.\nSuddenly, he said that he gave me the Ned Company 's Traffic Certificate.\nI did not know anything at that time. I thought that there was no problem ....

ID=100385115
The director seemed to be in a hurry.\nAfter that, the Rapid Flame surprise unit attacked the Ned Company ... occupied.

ID=100385116
Rapid Flame! What?\n... is that Henry isolated in Ned Company?

ID=100385117
The possibility is high.\nBut ... there is no way to confirm that.

ID=100385118
... Emilito.\nDo you want a deal?

ID=100385119
Transaction ...... I see.\nThen, this time I will search for Henry inside the Ned Company.

ID=100385120
Let's provide a security box that can unlock USB.\nOnce you download the data, you can unlock any lock on the Ned Company.

ID=100385121
Are there any problems with your entering the Ned Company?

ID=100385122
Let's go looking for Henry.\nEven if you do not have it, you can unlock the USB in the security box.

ID=100385123
I will support the inside things.\nFirst ... please annihilate the occupied Rapid Flame.

ID=100385124
Wow! Ka ... it is cool!\nIt looks like a real villain!

ID=100385125
......

ID=100385126
......

ID=510038501
Apparently, the elevator does not seem to work.\nIt seems that an internal power failure has occurred.

ID=510038502
The facilities are damaged due to Rapid Flame raids ....\nUsing an elevator will be difficult.

ID=510038503
What is the solution?

ID=510038504
Of course.

ID=410038501
Although it is a bit laborious ....

ID=210039001
Ned Company has many emergency power supply units.\nWhen power from outside is cut off, it is a device that converts to internal power.

ID=210039002
This is what is called sub power,\nWhen starting in emergency, the main power of the building is forcibly activated.\nSimply put, the elevator moves.

ID=210039003
However, the power supply device for operating the sub power\nIt must be started manually.

ID=210039004
Scanning the inside of the facility also found that it was necessary to start the security box\nIt was also confirmed that a security key exists.

ID=210039005
The security key is the number 2 of the surprise attack troops,\nThe code name "Benin" has it.\nPlease turn on the power supply and take security key from Benin.

ID=210039006
After that ....\nI will tell you after securing the security key.

ID=210039007
Will not you tell me first?

ID=210039008
There is a possibility that the strategy will fail.\nIt would be better not to leak information as much as possible to each other.

ID=210039009
Well then, you can trust the story you've ever taught?

ID=210039010
Oh, I'm doing well so far.\nWell, thank you for your next action.

ID=610039001
There are 2 things you want me to do.\nActivate the power supply and defeat Benin to secure the security key.\nthat's all.

ID=310039001
After starting the power supply unit, defeat the codename "Benin"\nPlease secure the security key.\nLet's leave the following explanation afterward.

ID=510039001
Thank you for your hard work.\nWe confirmed the main power securing by the operation of the power supply unit.

ID=510039002
Moreover, securing of the security key could also be confirmed.

ID=410039001
However, there is no such thing ....\nAre you willing to work at the Ned Company?

ID=210039501
This leaves you to the security floor,\nUSB and docking with security box,\nIt is only to release the data lock.

ID=210039502
That's awesome security ....

ID=210039503
Then, please hurry.\nNed company inside ... ....

ID=210039504
wait.

ID=210039505
...?\nEmilito, what's the matter?

ID=210039506
I asked for your cooperation with a light feeling ....\nI wonder if I can proceed with more than this any more ....

ID=210039507
I see.\nIs it necessary to report?

ID=210039508
Oh ... so far as the talk has decided so far,\nWe can not let go of things alone.

ID=210039509
... From the old days, you are too serious.

ID=210039510
It is not serious, I just put in mind.

ID=210039511
No, Emilito is serious. ... The more you are stupid.

ID=210039512
......\nLet's report to Toll commander,%username%.

ID=610039501
Jeremy is here.

ID=610039502
Hmm? Er ... That ....

ID=610039503
I will return soon ....\nWait a while with Lauffer.

ID=610039504
No.\nI understand.

ID=610039505
(Let's go report to Toll with Emilito)

ID=610039506
......

ID=610039507
......

ID=610039508
......

ID=610039509
......\nOh, that hobby of Laufa ....

ID=610039510
... Because you are awkward, you will never speak forcibly.\nThere is something compatible with people.

ID=610039511
of….

ID=310039501
You go to report to the superior, do not you?

ID=100395101
Yup? What is it?\nWas not it all going well?

ID=100395102
Interim report?\nI do not think there was anything that needs reporting so far ....

ID=100395103
No way ...!\nDid you want to change job by looking at the facilities of Ned Company ...?

ID=100395104
... Leader, calm down.\nIt looks like a serious expression. Try to say.

ID=100395105
...... No, I just came back to the report.

ID=100395106
......?

ID=100395107
I am sorry.\nHowever, due to an emergency situation, we needed to move first.\nAnd ... sometimes it gets worrisome ....

ID=100395108
What is worrisome?

ID=100395109
According to Rafer, Henry arrives at Grace City,\nIt seems that he went into the building of Ned Company.\nThen, Rapid Flame surprised the raid at timing.

ID=100395110
Also, there are strange things about the behavior of Rapid Flame.\nSomehow, I possessed the security key of the main equipment in the facility ....

ID=100395111
Well, it certainly is strange ....\nWhy are you so familiar with the inside of the facility?

ID=100395112
That's it.\nBesides, if the purpose of Rapid Flame is to occupy a building ....

ID=100395113
Henry in it can not be okay?

ID=100395114
That's right.\nEven though there are several strange points, laufer is nothing in particular ....\nAnd ... I also feel like I'm in a hurry somehow.

ID=100395115
Hmm, you ... do you doubt a friend?

ID=100395116
Well ... That will be so.

ID=100395117
... Oh, what happened already?\nYou are still young ... ... Are you overwhelmed by the raging waves of the world?

ID=100395118
Is not it doubtful ....\nRafer may also be used.

ID=100395119
It might be a trap ....

ID=100395120
... That possibility is also considered.

ID=100395121
However, I can not go wrong.\nIt is your turn. After entering Ned Company,\nDock the security box and USB and unlock it.

ID=100395122
Strategy officer, is it okay?\nThe possibility of being a trap ....

ID=100395123
You understand after understanding.\nIf you keep silent, do you think Henry will surrender himself?\nUSB lock is automatically released?

ID=100395124
Is not it?\nJust waiting will not solve anything.

ID=100395125
However, Ned Company has a codenamed "poison" ....

ID=100395126
... That woman?

ID=100395127
I confirmed it when scanning inside.

ID=100395128
Well then, I have to go ahead.\nSuch a chance is rare, is not it?

ID=100395129
You should go to Kane Barrel.\nSince I have fought against poisoning, I will be of assistance.

ID=100395130
......

ID=100395131
It was a shame even though I reported it with great pains. Emilito.

ID=100395132
I do not have any meaning unless you act.\nconspiracy? trap? You ought to destroy all such things. right?

ID=510039501
What happened, a newcomer.

ID=510039502
... Codename "poison"?\nWhy are you talking about the woman suddenly?

ID=410039501
... combat?

ID=210040001
Following the chief of the charge chief "Scar\\nI do not know if luck is good or bad.

ID=210040002
Before one year ago ... I have fought with poison.\nHonestly, I thought that it was a woman and I saw it sweetly.

ID=210040003
However, the ability of the guy is genuine.\nHe was forced to struggle badly.

ID=210040004
Gallant power, arm strength, fighting sense ... There was no inconvenience in all of them.\nWhat was painfully hot ....

ID=210040005
Hmmm ... It might be better to taste this directly.\nBesides battle, I have a skill to deceive people skillfully.

ID=210040006
Well, try doing it well.\nI do not particularly say anything from me.

ID=210040007
... Is it a wonderful face for advice?\nIn you and me, different weapons and different styles.\nAdvice is not useful.

ID=210040008
Anyway at full strength.\nDo not be ashamed of yourself.

ID=610040001
... Please go straight to the Ned Company.\nBecause I have contacted Laufa.

ID=610040002
And then, NBRF ... Ned Company's elite mercenaries\nIt seems to support battle.\nWhether this is pure favored is a mystery ....

ID=610040003
Anyway, your warrior.\nbe careful ....

ID=510040001
You seem to have returned.

ID=410040001
Thank you for your good work.

ID=210040501
The USB lock seems to have been unlocked successfully.\nBesides, to drive away to the codename "poison" ....

ID=210040502
USB information has already been transferred to us.\nBecause it will be backed up automatically the moment you dock into the security box.

ID=210040503
So, the USB that you have is Amaryllis' report.\nIt is neither more nor less than it.

ID=210040504
Rafer ... You ....

ID=210040505
Do not look like that, Emilito.\nWe also need to confirm what Henry Director did.

ID=210040506
Do not judge us as Henry Board.\nDepending on the content of USB ... this may be forced to choose.

ID=210040507
......

ID=210040508
What is the alternative? ... When all contents of USB are analyzed, I will share it.\nIt is not a difficult task, so please come back for a while.

ID=210040509
Well, see you later.

ID=610040501
... Anyhow, I became looked after.

ID=610040502
Here too.

ID=610040503
Let's go back, Jeremy.

ID=610040504
No!

ID=310040501
I will tell you when the decoding of USB is over.\nPlease wait just a little.

ID=100405101
Thank you for your hard work.\nIt was an unexpected result ....

ID=100405102
Now I have no choice but to believe Laufer's words.\nIt is uneasy whether I will pass USB data obediently ....

ID=100405103
Anyway, Henry is still missing,\nAll confidential documents passed to Ned Company ....\nIt is not very good situation.

ID=100405104
... I'm sorry.\nThe situation has flowed in an unexpected direction ....

ID=100405105
I would like to summarize the idea a little more.\nMay I ask you to leave me alone for a while?

ID=100405201
Thank you for your hard work!\nThe situation ... is not it good feeling?

ID=100405202
But I believe!\nRafer is betraying Emilito ....\nThe world can not perish!

ID=100405203
I came across two people since I entered the troops,\nI heard that they were always together!

ID=100405204
It is said that it is tied by a deep bond than the family.\nI was told that he was Commandor.\nIf you have such a close friend, life is nothing but a success!

ID=100405205
So I believe!\nI do not know the intent of Laufa well,\nIt should not be true! !

ID=100405206
If you want to know more about two people,\nYou should ask Sora!\nIt is very close to those two!

ID=510040501
Hello.\nWould you mind waiting a minute? Creating a list of medical items ....

ID=510040502
Well ... 30 boxes of Medi Box and 2 Soul Injections ... ....\nCure jelly ... 5 boxes .... Hmm? A box is missing?

ID=510040503
... It is serious. Why ....\nOh, I sent it to Mr. Kacha ... Huh.

ID=510040504
OK. List creation completion っ と ....

ID=510040505
... Well, what do you want?

ID=410040501
Laufa and Emilito ...?\nDo you want to listen to those two stories?

ID=210041001
Well ... Actually I do not know the details.\nBecause I was not raised with them.

ID=210041002
However, since we go out with our two people long, we have heard many stories.\nWhere shall we speak from ...?

ID=210041003
The first encounter was Emilito.\nI and Emilito graduated from military school,\nBecause my first assignment was Grace City ....

ID=210041004
I greeted each other, I did not talk about private things at all.\nAt such time, there is a large restructuring at the Ned Company,\nRafer has come to Grace City.

ID=210041005
When Emilito and I were on patrol, I came across Laufa by chance.\nAt that time, Emilito and Rafer had gotten together.

ID=210041006
The two ran away from neither, and embraced each other.\nIt was the first time that Emilito saw a crying voice crying.

ID=210041007
From then on, I was a BL who made the two guys the main character ... ....\nNo, no ... nothing ....\nAnd anyway ... then they were always together as they were.

ID=210041008
To tell the story from the two people, it was actually a reunion for the first time in five years ....\nEmilito to the Star Forest Alliance,\nLaufer applied to Ned Company.

ID=210041009
It seems that he was desperately trying to survive in the past with a crow dream as a point.\nI heard that my hometown was completely gone by Seoul Junk attacks and my family all lost their lives.

ID=210041010
He said that he did anything to survive.\nAs expected I did not tell you the contents ....\nI felt that I had a struggling unparalleled.

ID=210041011
He seemed to think it many times to give up living already.\nBut ... I was told that they endured each other while supporting each other.

ID=210041012
These two people met again.\n... They only know their feelings.

ID=210041013
But the problem is ... Emilito to the Star Forest Alliance,\nRafer is belonging to Ned Company.

ID=210041014
Of course, the gaze from the surroundings was cold.\nOpinions are cooperative relationships with Star Forest Union and Ned Company,\nIt is not exaggeration to say that it is actually a relationship between dogs.

ID=210041015
It is not once or twice that he was charged with spies.\nNonetheless, each time they insisted on innocence with each other's friendship.

ID=210041016
Even though either one seems to break if it is pursued as much as that,\nThere was not such a thing only for those two people.\nRather, I had been better friends than before.

ID=210041017
There are such things several times ....\nThe cold surroundings gaze also began to relax.\nOh, those two really understand ... and.

ID=210041018
Recently, no one said anything even if they were together.\nWell ... Is it a kind of accredited couple?

ID=210041019
Is it a situation that is becoming suspicious if it is a story you heard?\nThere is a possibility that Laufa cheated the Star Forest Alliance ... and.

ID=210041020
Well, I am not worried.\nIt has been only a few years, I have seen the two of them.\nIt can be asserted that such a thing is impossible.

ID=210041021
I can not imagine that Laufa will betray Emilito.\nOf course, the opposite is also ....

ID=210041022
Well ... Although the talk has long been overwhelming,\nWas it useful?

ID=210041023
Then, I will return to work.\nOh, the story of the boy is fun, is not it? Huhuh ....

ID=210041024
Ah! If they have strange movements please let me know!\nBecause both of them got tremendous support from women.

ID=210041025
Well, exactly, if "two people" are together, popularity will rise soon ....\nThe girls' world is like that.

ID=610041001
Okay, I will excuse myself.

ID=610041002
(I will not talk any more. Let's return to where Lauffer)

ID=310041001
(I will not talk anymore) Let's return to the place of Laufa

ID=100410101
I was waiting.

ID=100410102
The USB data analysis has ended.\nAs expected ... not only the information of the codename "Amaryllis".

ID=100410103
Budget, experiment flow, various simulation values ​​to make 'Amaryllis' ....\nApprovers, list of participating researchers, responsible person ... All the materials were included.

ID=100410104
Besides, there was a name of Henry Executive Director in the column of general manager of the project.\nIt was carefully prepared for electronic signatures.

ID=100410105
That is, a project which made human beings experimentally very intentionally ....\nThat person in charge is Henry Director.

ID=100410106
This is a fact that there is no room for defense.\nSo Ned Company Director Henry ...\nNo, I made a decision that wanted Henry.

ID=100410107
It is a matter he advanced himself, and has never been reported in the upper level.\nEcclesiastical acts, inhuman experiments, unauthorized use of resources ...\nThere is no excuse to raise the charges.

ID=100410108
Ned Company to arrest Henry\nWe decided to cooperate with the Star Forest Alliance.\nIn other words, it can officially track Henry.

ID=100410109
Thank you for your cooperation.\nI am grateful to you as well as to the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=100410110
As a substitute, the Board of Directors of Ned Company is a member of the Star Forest Alliance\nI decided to support "Wolf Cly" operation.

ID=100410111
Please tell this to the Star Forest Alliance.\nI have already sent the full text, but I do not mind letting it in oral directly.

ID=100410112
Please give me another thank you. Thank you very much.\nLet's meet again.

ID=510041001
What's wrong?

ID=410041001
Ned Company wanted Henry?\nSo? Strategy support?

ID=410041002
Look, look.

ID=210041501
I heard there was no report in the upper part? It makes me laugh.\nIt is impossible for the gold to have noticeable eye-catchers understand where their money is going.

ID=210041502
As soon as I pressed it, I threw Henry and treated it as a piece ....\nI wonder how sex is rotten.

ID=210041503
In any case, will you support Wolf Cry's operation?\nIt was just right. I was suffering from lack of budget.

ID=210041504
This is all settled ....\nA newcomer, you are the mainstay of the Wolf Cry operation.

ID=210041505
It is the work you took.\nThanks to you that the interrupted strategy breathed back.\nComplete until the end.

ID=210041506
The strategy of this time is a large-scale strategy of budget crying ....\nIf you make this successful, your stock will climb eel!

ID=210041507
Then, after confirming the contents of the strategy from Heavy Gears,\nTowards the workplace immediately.

ID=610041501
Opportunity for promotion.\nYou can not let go of it, right?

ID=310041501
Please check the content of the strategy from members of Heavy Gears.

ID=100415101
I talked, I heard.\nWill you do it? It is the main force of such a large scale strategy.

ID=100415102
The strategy is easy.\nShoot down the Rapid Flame assault unit flying around in the air with a missile.

ID=100415103
Hill breaker special tank,\nI just fire Dr. Sedulin special missile.

ID=100415104
Is not it? Easy ... do not you think?\nBut, there is a problem a bit.

ID=100415105
Special missiles and special tanks that I have not seen\nIf it appears on the battlefield, you will be warned of course?

ID=100415106
Your mission will guide Hill Breaker safely to the operational area,\nHelp us to shoot missiles.

ID=100415107
It costs huge cost for this strategy.\nFailure is not permitted. I understood?

ID=100415108
Then, go to Maxim's place.\nAs Hill Breaker is responsible, please listen to me a lot.

ID=100415201
You came a lot.

ID=100415202
Is it introduced as the main force of the operation of Wolf Cry?\nHa ha ha! Sure, I do not miss the promotion!

ID=100415203
It is the special tank "Hill breaker" that puts in Wolf Cly.\nMagnetic field is mounted on the front and boasts the highest level of armor.

ID=100415204
Anyway, Dr. Sedulin special missile "F-Aria" of\nIt's the only tank that can fit a dedicated launch pad.

ID=100415205
If Hill Breaker gets stuck, the strategy is over.\nPay close attention so as not to be broken.

ID=100415206
Well, it is not such a feeling.\nI'm not proud, but the Eagle did the design and production.

ID=100415207
Oops, it's about time.\nHave you heard of the strategy from the run?\nExplanation of the tank is over ... ....

ID=100415208
Is only the explanation of "F-Aria missile"?\nGo to Dr. Sedulin. It is a boss of missile production.

ID=510041501
Oh, new!

ID=410041501
Fu ... ... Because the Ned Company suddenly cooperates and said that ~\nThanks to you I've become busy ... ... Faa ~.

ID=210042001
The point of the operation of Wolf Cry is F - Aria missile.\nI developed it ~. Do not you think?

ID=210042002
F is Final's F! It is meant to be the last cast.\nThe characteristic of F - Aria is, it is not an explosion, it is a sound release.

ID=210042003
Rapid Flame's assault unit,\nI mean the big birds like Carla are the mainstay ~!\nSo, obviously I can not catch it easily ~.

ID=210042004
We also avoid anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft missiles ~.\nThat's why I put my eyes there.\nInvisible, unavoidable, the range is wide!

ID=210042005
If you can play the F - Aria missile in the air,\nHigh power sound waves spread widely ~.\nThe enemy who receives the sound wave is crazy the balanced organ in the back of the ear and can not fly well.

ID=210042006
Therefore, no matter how much birds you have fallen for,\nIt 's easy to catch on the ground.\nNamed, "Sé Durin sama flying birds!" It's a strategy ~.

ID=210042007
This F - Aria missile is a bottleneck that fuel is extremely expensive,\nNed company will face it ~.\nThat's why, if you shoot a missile like this, it's all ok.

ID=210042008
Because Maxim's grandmother is already in the strategy ~.\nYou'd better join the news quickly.

ID=210042009
That uncle, I do a good job,\nI am worried about it.

ID=210042010
Well, new!\nDo your best.

ID=610042001
Join the maxim of Maxim that I went to ~.

ID=310042001
I join the Majim 's previous maid who I went to ~.

ID=100420101
It was faster than I expected.

ID=100420102
Did you hear the situation from Senia?\nAlright, I will hurry!

ID=100420103
Besides, I did not misunderstand the traveling route separately!\nToo short of trying to make a short cut ...!

ID=100420104
......

ID=100420105
...... sorry. The eagle was bad.

ID=100420106
We installed a high-performance C4 in front of the debris.\nIf you explode it you should erase in an instant.

ID=100420107
However, if you explode at this distance you will blow off to Eagle.\nWell, I'll leave it to you!

ID=100420108
I believe it!

ID=510042001
Wow ....

ID=510042002
I came ... ....\nKurukurapa handling C4 bomb with bare hands ~.

ID=410042001
It was good for a soul worker.\nAn ordinary person disappeared without a trace.

ID=210042501
Well, I must thank you for the funny new behavior.\nHill breaker movement route was secured,\nAll I have to do is go to the missile launch position.

ID=210042502
Please properly clean up the Rapid Flame pet on the way.\nA new entrance went with a dirt, and it was a while! Rapidly,\nBecause Hill Breaker is also a Dogone. Is not it?

ID=210042503
Go for it, go ahead.

ID=210042504
Oh, that's right. Kane was also looking for newcomers ~.\nTry a bit before going.

ID=610042501
Kane is about Kane Barrel. You know that ~ ~?\nI am looking for newcomers, so I'm going to go.

ID=310042501
Why do not you go to Kane and have a cry?

ID=100425101
Did you come, a newcomer.

ID=100425102
I was also instructed to join the Wolf Cry operation.

ID=100425103
Is not it the first time to hold hands with soul workers?\nHow much appreciate is enough to leave behind ....\nTry it well.

ID=100425104
You should go first.\nJoin immediately.

ID=100425105
Wow. Cane is cool ~!

ID=100425106
... Seduline.\nWere not you sleeping time?

ID=100425107
'Cause I can not see the best invention made by me now when I am asleep?

ID=100425108
Hmm, what is it for?\nI am standing now.

ID=100425109
What? I just wondered what Kane would say to the newcomer ~.

ID=100425110
How much appreciate is enough to leave the back ... try to taste well.\nCa, cool ~!

ID=100425111
... ... noob.\nlet's go.

ID=100425112
Good luck with both of you ~.

ID=510042501
Do not do, you are new.

ID=410042501
I have heard that it was not long before I woke up from the blank ... ....\nThis guy seems to be a terrible guy waking up.

ID=210043001
It is a while to praise.\nFirst, concentrate on things in front of you.

ID=210043002
The operation of Wolf Cry is a great success.\nMore than 80% of Carla troops fell to the ground, and it seems that allies are dead.

ID=210043003
It is a result far beyond expectation.\nThe headquarters is also bored.\nIt seems that nearly 400 paid vacation certificates have already been distributed.

ID=210043004
Well, it is a story I do not care about with you.

ID=210043005
Then another one.\nIt seems that the codename "Queen Carla" crashed.

ID=210043006
There was no way to capture it because of its mobility, that Queen Carla.\nIt is the mainstay of the assault unit and is also the bird of Captain of the Assault Section "Falcon".

ID=210043007
It's a great opportunity.\nA newcomer, you have stopped breathing.

ID=610043001
I will return home with this.\nIt is here to lend a hand.

ID=610043002
Queen Carla is a strong enemy ....\nYou do not have any problem.

ID=610043003
Well, win and come back.

ID=310043001
Even witnessing Queen Carla is a very difficult business.\nWhether it can be brought into battle ... Is it only to know the heavens?

ID=310043002
Get crazy and go wrong!

ID=510043001
noob. You do better than you thought?

ID=410043001
Well done.\nIn addition to the great success of missile launch operations, to Queen Carla .... There is no further result.

ID=410043002
Even with a reward ... it is!\nWhy do not you give gifts under underwear? Senior.

ID=410043003
Oh, what's wrong?\nAre underwear not enough?

ID=410043004
No, Senior ... the underwear you wear.\nNow, at this place!

ID=410043005
... Huh.\nThat's the least scum.

ID=210043501
Let's organize the situation.\nCarla troops are almost completely annihilated with F - Aria missiles.

ID=210043502
In the process Queen Carla crashed well and lost by newcomers ....\nWell, from here it is important.

ID=210043503
Queen Carla is Captain of the Assault Section ... Yes, Falcon's love bird.\nIt is famous for his darling against Carla.

ID=210043504
If you see a wounded bird, ....\nOf course, the fury of anger faces you.

ID=210043505
It's rumored that when you become Queen Carla you will not be able to see the surroundings.\nI will definitely come.

ID=210043506
That is why I turned Falcon back on.\nIf it goes well, it is said that three Raptorafaimu commanders are knocked down\nI will give you a big handle.

ID=210043507
Well, the goal is already close.

ID=610043501
Oh, that seedurin was looking for you.\nTry to come before you go.

ID=610043502
... It sure looks like the reconnaissance is doing something.

ID=310043501
Try going to Sedulin.

ID=100435101
Oh, new!\nI have a favor to ask you a bit ~.

ID=100435102
You hear it, are not you ~?

ID=100435103
...... Huh.

ID=100435104
It seems that someone sighs right now ....\nI'm sure it's in your mind, is not it ~?

ID=100435105
Doctor.\nSuch a way of saying a good year ....

ID=100435106
I can see him more than me.\nReally ... I can not believe it 's in her twenties!

ID=100435107
Become\nI do not want the doctor to say!

ID=100435108
... to doctor ~?\nWhat does that mean?

ID=100435109
For those who have children 'size' rather than thirties\nI do not want to be told.

ID=100435110
......

ID=100435111
But even if I am a child recently I am an elementary school student\nIt may be bigger than doctor!

ID=100435112
Ho ho ho!\nOh ho ho ho!

ID=100435113
... Cayenne.\nPlease help me a bit.

ID=100435114
... It's not my curtain.

ID=100435115
......

ID=100435116
Sergeant Run.\nMaintenance of tanks ordered by me is over, right?

ID=100435117
Okho Ho ho ... ... ho ho ....\nGo, Gogh ... Oh, that's a bit more time ....

ID=100435118
Do not get troubled by me.\nThe principal Dr. of the ST lab unit has the authority of the sergeant class?

ID=100435119
Uh ... well, that is ....

ID=100435120
Violation of orders, neglect of work, abandonment of duties ....\nWell then, what kind of report should I give?

ID=100435121
Come on ...!\nWell, I will head to maintenance soon!

ID=100435122
Hurry up ~.\nAlso, no matter how big it is, if it does not have use, it is just fat.

ID=100435123
......

ID=100435124
Oh, sorry.\nMy request, could you ask me ~?

ID=100435125
......

ID=100435126
What?\nDid you receive the order of Falcon 's supposed -?

ID=100435127
I heard that it provoked Falcon well.\nIt's a perfect opportunity.

ID=100435128
Well ... I was in trouble.\nKane, do you have time?

ID=100435129
Ahh ....\nThere is some ... ....

ID=100435130
Well, if you can ask Cain, ~.

ID=100435131
... Please say the contents first.

ID=100435132
It seems that something happened in Dave Town ~.\nI think that it is better to check.

ID=100435133
Dave Town?\nI got a report that there was no abnormality 3 hours ago ....

ID=100435134
Well. But, suddenly the communication ceased.\nThere may not be anything, but I am interested anyway ~.

ID=100435135
I see ... I understand.\nNewly, Falcon you manage by yourself.

ID=100435136
I head for Dave Town.

ID=100435137
Thank you ~.\nI will depend on ~.

ID=100435138
Then you can go back to the assignment for newcomers.\nBoil the Falcon and make it bake and like it ~.

ID=510043501
It is our victory.

ID=410043501
Captain of the chief captain, captain of the raids captain, poison, captain of the assault section ... Falcon ....\nIt is said that only one soul worker will be punished.

ID=410043502
It's a big deal.\nYou are worthy to receive the Order of the Wounded Army!

ID=410043503
No, it is the medal of war dead or injury of honor.

ID=410043504
Then, I know ...!\nGohon, let's award Tall's Dundee Beard.\nThis medal is made of my beard ....

ID=410043505
... I will grant you. Destroy it.

ID=210044001
He has defeated Rapid Flame's three captains.\nAnyway, now I have nothing to do.

ID=210044002
What to do now to build a good superior image ....\nAs a result of various thinking ... I noticed that it is best to not order.

ID=210044003
If you think about it, have not you been slowly resting since you came to Grace City?\nI will give special free time.

ID=210044004
Walk around freely, love freely and leave descendants free. Ha ha ha!

ID=610044001
Why do not you go to Jeremy's place?

ID=610044002
Listening to the news that your guy has defeated Falcon,\nI wandered around here around once every five minutes.

ID=610044003
If you do not want to be bothered by stalkers, you'd better see them.\nWhy do not you try one of the signs?

ID=310044001
Please meet Jeremy.\nYour courage will save one stalker.

ID=100440101
Emilito!\nI came! I came!

ID=100440102
Jeremy ....\nIf I say calmly a few times ... a bit.

ID=100440103
I knocked down three of Rapid Flame's captains! What?\nI can not stay calm!

ID=100440104
......\nWhew, I like you ....

ID=100440105
It's amazing! It's too amazing!\nI do not think it is very new! Three of the captain classes ...!

ID=100440106
Now, Grace City is a story with this story!\nIt is a town fuss!

ID=100440107
Everyone's story than Kay Barrel's small captain ....

ID=100440108
Jeremy, refrain from the mouth.

ID=100440109
Oh ... sorry.\nAnd anyway! I'm with the story of%username%!

ID=100440110
I'm not making a big fuss!\nThe city is excited about the birth of a star!

ID=100440111
Thanks to that, Grace City has been booming for a long time.\nI am also happy.

ID=100440112
Then, believe in Lauffer ... Thank you.

ID=100440113
Although he had no choice but to listen to his request,\nI would not have even run even if you were not there.

ID=100440114
It lent me the power without hesitation ....\nTemporarily, it cleared up suspicion of Rafer.\nThank you very much.

ID=100440115
Today is a while ... I think I will have a drink with Lauffer.

ID=100440116
Me too! I will also go!

ID=100440117
... I will not let you drink.

ID=100440118
Ah ... if you say two people drink,\nSora was told to call me, but what shall you do?

ID=100440119
... No, Sora is dangerous.\nThat ... in various ways ....

ID=100440120
What? What?

ID=100440201
Aw? Are not you Hideo Holds celebrating right now?\nIs there something I can do for this servant of the common people?

ID=100440202
Haha, it is a joke. joke.\nHowever, it is true that you are talking about in Grace City.

ID=100440203
Thank you for your hard work.\nIn such a case, it would have been better if I also went together.

ID=100440204
What I got at per caprice,\nThat is easy going away from that, Roy.

ID=100440205
Also ... such ... I am seriously serious.\nLet's block that mouth all the more.

ID=100440206
... I wonder where I learned how to use such a mouth.

ID=100440207
Ha ha ... it is a joke, a joke.\nYou will not be able to talk about becoming irritated every time.

ID=100440208
Here, let's laugh.\nIf you make a smile forcibly, there may be good things.

ID=100440209
Actually, as I was laughing,\nBecause I came across such a wonderful job.

ID=100440210
......\nI understand. From now on I will try to laugh as much as possible.

ID=100440211
Yes Yes.\nWell, please laugh. Smile ~.

ID=100440212
......

ID=100440213
By the way, are you just hanging around without doing now?\nI'm jealous.\nIf you are born again, you want to be a soul worker!

ID=100440214
... As a soul worker,\nOnly the owner of a very pure heart.

ID=100440215
Uh ... well ... Is it impossible for me not to have a pure heart?

ID=100440216
To the mood shop ... it will be difficult.

ID=100440217
Well ... have you come so ...?\nWell then, how about a walk with that mood?

ID=100440218
Hmm?\nWere you going for a walk, you did it before?

ID=100440219
There is not yesterday in the mood any more.\nWell, please prepare. It's a fun walking time.

ID=100440220
No, I will hold back today.\nIf you impossible to do anything more, your body will ....

ID=100440221
Such an excuse will not pass in a mood shop.

ID=100440222
... It can not be helped.\nlet's go.

ID=100440223
Did you hear it? Mine and Mr. Nab take a walk.\nPlease enjoy your time off slowly.

ID=510044001
Did you enjoy your free time?

ID=510044002
May I hope you enjoyed it?\nAn incident occurred.

ID=410044001
It seems that something has happened in Dave Town.

ID=210044501
Sedurin first sensed the incident.\nI contacted Dave Town, but there was no response.

ID=210044502
It seems that he was planning to urge the Grand Olivier of 12 years age.\nOh, it's about the value-added sake. That drinking drink ...

ID=210044503
Because it can not be contacted anyhow, Cedulin put in Kane Barrel\nI grasp the details that happened in Dave Town.

ID=210044504
Result is ... ....

ID=210044505
After the CM!

ID=210044506
... Dave Town has become a ghost town.\nMore than 300 inhabitants disappeared without a trace.

ID=210044507
Senior! What to do!\nThanks to the sponsor, I am having a bite ...!

ID=210044508
... There is no trace of battle.\nThe building is also intact, there is no blood stain.

ID=210044509
There seems to be a clear trace of people in the building just until a while ago.\nTo the meal of the meal, the floor where warmth remains.

ID=210044510
According to the word, the inhabitants disappeared in a moment.\nThere is no trace.

ID=210044511
Kane Barrels are desperately searching, but,\nThere is no result yet to say this.

ID=210044512
I want to get you heading to Dave Town as well.

ID=610044501
You can find any traces from whatever you like.\nTraces like you can grasp the details ....

ID=310044501
Go to Dave Town and find traces.\nI do not care anything. I have to make sure what happened ....

ID=510044501
Clothes ... clothes ....\nHm ... not clothes ....

ID=510044502
This is good, but ....\nI wonder what I should do.

ID=510044503
The fact that Rapid Flame was,\nClearly that there is something ... what the hell ....

ID=410044501
Oh ... my head hurts.

ID=210045001
Give this to Sora and ask for a survey.

ID=210045002
Is there any strange ingredients attached or there are strange points ...?\nAnyway, I want you to analyze in detail.

ID=210045003
That's all I can do right now.\nThere is no choice but to pray that something clues will come out.

ID=610045001
Well, I can not expect much though ....

ID=310045001
Ask Sora for an investigation of clothes.\nAnyway, look for clues.

ID=100450101
Yes, the content is being asked from the strategy officer.\nIt is a survey of this clothes, is not it?

ID=100450102
Apparently, there seems to be no abnormality in particular ....\nLet's turn it over a bit.

ID=100450103
Well ... what makes the back side particularly conspicuous ....\nHmm? This feeling ... It is something.

ID=100450104
Something seems to be attached.\nthis is ....

ID=100450105
......

ID=100450106
Hey!

ID=100450107
(Sora was surprised and dropped his clothes)

ID=100450108
Th-This is ....\nIn the clothes ....

ID=100450109
It is the skin ....\nHuman skin ...!

ID=100450110
How, why human skin ....

ID=100450111
It is as thin as this ... it looks like it is coated.

ID=100450112
Sorry, sorry!\nThis ... it does not seem to be a problem I can manage.

ID=100450113
Please go to Dr. Sedulin!\nMore detailed ingredient analysis is required!

ID=510045001
Yup. I heard stories from Sora ~.\nI will analyze the ingredients immediately ~.

ID=510045002
Because analysis takes a little time,\nWill you wait ~ ~?

ID=410045001
Apparently ... It seems not to be just ~.

ID=210045501
An analysis result came out.\nAs Sora said ... this is human skin ~.

ID=210045502
The problem is why this was on the inside of the clothes ....\n... There is one thing I think is not it ~.

ID=210045503
Seoul Energy always exists in the human body ~.\nThe division between the general person and the disability person depends on the amount of energy.

ID=210045504
In principle, bodies and soul workers are sturdier.\nSo, I can save a lot of soul energy ....

ID=210045505
Normal people can not save a lot of soul energy ~.\nThe body can not bear it.

ID=210045506
Well, I feel like putting air into the balloon.\nIf the balloon is durable, you will have plenty of air?

ID=210045507
But, if air more than the allowable value of the balloon is injected ....\nYou know what will happen?

ID=210045508
The reason is unknown, but ~\nSeoul Energy which exploded in the body\nI think I blew away the enveloped body.

ID=210045509
So it may have stuck to the inside of the clothes ~.

ID=210045510
Bring yourself out, bringing in Spirit Pathfinder,\nInstall it in Dave Town ~.

ID=610045501
This is a machine to check the variation of Seoul Energy within a certain range ~.\nIf my hypothesis is right ... there should have been unnatural energy movements in Dave Town ~.

ID=610045502
That is to say, to find traces of explosion ~.\nThe person who caused the explosion should be Seoul Energy ~.

ID=610045503
The fact that all the residents disappeared, only the clothes remained ....\nIt is enough if there is an explosion trace of Seoul Energy ~.

ID=610045504
The cause is unknown ....\nResidents exploded Seoul Energy at the same time,\nIt is said that the disappearance incident of this time occurred ... -.

ID=610045505
Well, there is no doubt that Rapid Flame is involved.\nIt is postponement to clarify that.\nNow the priority is to figure out what happened.

ID=610045506
Hurry up, new!

ID=310045501
Go to Dave Town and set up Spirit Pathfinder.

ID=510045501
I got a terrible thing.

ID=410045501
Anyway, I will take the part of you.\nI will investigate ~.

ID=410045502
I will also check the scan results of Spirit Pathfinder ~.\nWait a moment.

ID=210046001
It seems like it will take it yet

ID=210046002
We also confirmed the scan results of Spirit Pathfinder,\nParts survey is over.

ID=210046003
First, from the scan result of Spirit Pathfinder ~.\nMore than 300 in Dave Town\nIt turned out that the explosion phenomenon of Seoul Energy had occurred ~.

ID=210046004
In other words ... everyone in the deve town.

ID=210046005
......

ID=210046006
Then, this tentacle.\nBasically it tends to be used for attack and control,\nThere is another real feature.

ID=210046007
The wire of the tentacle is a pipe that sends soul energy.\nSoul Energy that vaporizes at once in the atmosphere\nTo move it somewhere ~.

ID=210046008
Evaporate people ... is it collecting energy?

ID=210046009
Oh yeah ~. Maybe Tempest itself thinks it is a tank to store soul energy.\nThere was a big tempest where the newcomer fought last.\nHe was using a shield made up of Soul Energy ~.

ID=210046010
In other words, Rapid Flame now can use even Seoul Energy ~.\nThis plan ... I guess I knew it was long ago ~ ~.

ID=210046011
To involve civilians ....\nEven though I was someone who had pride as it was ... it fell down.

ID=210046012
Also, there is something more to worry about ~.

ID=210046013
That shield that the big tempest used ....\nIt is Seoul Energy for ten people at most, is not it ~!\nI wonder where I went for the remaining 290 people.

ID=210046014
Are you trying to make a power armed with shield ...?

ID=210046015
Well ... I think it's different. It's inefficient.\nDedicated facilities are necessary, and the range is also limited ~.

ID=210046016
I will not use energy that I gained carefully.

ID=210046017
I see ... I still have something to say.\nI do not know right now, though.

ID=210046018
Then, the result of the last survey.\n... This may be the most important point.

ID=210046019
That pipe making up the tentacle of Tempest ... ....\nI used to see it before long.

ID=210046020
At the technology conference of Ned Company ~.

ID=210046021
... What was that?

ID=210046022
I remember it clearly ~.\nAs an ordinary human being, a different person or a soul worker\nIt is a kind of plan to strengthen ....

ID=210046023
It was a means to control soul energy evaporating in the air ~.\nSeoul Energy, which is inside the pipe,\nIt does not evaporate and fulfills its function as pure energy ~.

ID=210046024
... Wait, can I organize it once?

ID=210046025
Tempest catches people and absorbs Seoul Energy.\nThe tempest is due to the technology of Ned Company?

ID=210046026
With Sogo ~.

ID=210046027
... noob.\nI will go to Laufa.

ID=610046001
I have to check what it is ....

ID=310046001
Because the technology of Ned Company is used for Tempest ~\nWhy do not you go to Lauffer and check it out.

ID=100460101
long time no see.\nThen how is it going?

ID=100460102
This, you made, do not you?

ID=100460103
...?\nthis is ...?

ID=100460104
Do not be fucked.\nDid you make it? Are not you making it?

ID=100460105
... .... Certainly.\nIt is Seoul Energy pipe developed by Ned Company two years ago.

ID=100460106
... You guys, did you hold hands with Vesi?

ID=100460107
What are you talking about suddenly ...?\nPlease explain the situation.

ID=100460108
Rapid Flame 's killing weapon,\nThe parts you developed were used.\nI will hear it again. ... did you hold hands with Vesi?

ID=100460109
It is different.\nI understand the situation, but it is misplaced to treat us as a traitor.

ID=100460110
Then, why are they doing this ...?

ID=100460111
Development of this part has already been stopped.\nTo energize Soul Energy,\nBecause I needed Seoul Energy for one human being ....

ID=100460112
In other words, priority was given to human life and development was canceled.\nWhy now it is ....

ID=100460113
So, why did they go to their hands!

ID=100460114
In the first place, what is the evidence that it is ours?\nIndeed development of Seoul Energy pipe was stopped two years ago ... ....

ID=100460115
......

ID=100460116
... what?\nWhat's the matter?

ID=100460117
... Wait.\nby the way ....

ID=100460118
Suddenly what?\nJust say something.

ID=100460119
......

ID=100460120
The responsible person for the project was ... Henry.

ID=100460121
... What was that?

ID=100460122
There is no mistake.\nHenry was conducting the project.

ID=100460123
I remember Henry was rough after the project was canceled.\nIt is like closing the door to the new world that opened.

ID=100460124
... Henry got on Rapid Flame's side?

ID=100460125
... As far as I see this situation, I think so.

ID=100460126
Let's see where the things developed in that project were taken out.\nThen you need to strengthen Henry's arrangement ....

ID=100460127
I will not wait long.\nDo something before my patience ends.

ID=100460128
Please wait a moment ....

ID=100460129
... noob.\nI will go back once.

ID=510046001
Commander.

ID=510046002
Yes. I heard it from Sedulin.\nIt seems that Ned Company is involved.

ID=510046003
It is also in a rather malignant form ....

ID=410046001
It has been quite a long since the war started.\nHumans still can not cooperate ...?

ID=210046501
Henry was responsible for related technology?\nWell ... that talk about the topic, that man.

ID=210046502
I have not decided yet.\nThere is almost no mistake from the situation.\nSince Lauffer enters the survey, results will be obtained in a while.

ID=210046503
Nonetheless, we can not just wait.\nI have asked Cedulin to investigate Dave Town.\nTry going.

ID=610046501
There should be a certain place to collect soul energy.\nIt is enough to energize a medium-sized town, it is obvious that you are planning something.

ID=610046502
I agree.\nIf it is not the purpose of collecting it in one place,\nThe tank like Tempest should have been unnecessary.

ID=610046503
I do not have any meaning such as uncovering their plot any longer.\nThe important thing is that Rapid Flame has crossed a line.

ID=310046501
Go to Sedulin.\nThere should be places where Soul Energy gather in a large amount in Dave Town.

ID=100465101
Nice timing ~.\nIt is just the end of the survey ~.

ID=100465102
There is a place where Seoul Energy value is high in Dave Town ~.\nI do not know the details because of the noise, but the height of this number is abnormal ~.

ID=100465103
Simply convert this to physical energy ....\nAbout the outline of Grace City is blown away ~ ~.

ID=100465104
so much?

ID=100465105
Yup. Several hundred Seoul Energy are condensed.

ID=100465106
Newly, hurry up.\nIf you do not strike a hand before Rapid Flame, it will be hard work.

ID=100465107
Excuse me.

ID=100465108
Lauffer?

ID=100465109
I understood the delivery route of Seoul Energy pipe.\nAs expected ... Henry finally, the subsequent route is unknown.

ID=100465110
Ned Company will arrange Henry with a first grade spy and a backlit act.\nBecause we have also decided to introduce NBRF, there is no guarantee of life ....

ID=100465111
You cut it quite a bit.

ID=100465112
It is not a gentle company to give mercy to traitors.\nBesides ... if you betray it just yet, I'll be going to Vesi ....\nIt is not permissible.

ID=100465113
Hmm ... well, whatever.\nNew, preparations are good, do not you think?

ID=100465114
Then go.\nNow is the time to show strength.

ID=100465115


ID=100465116
You seem to be ready.

ID=100465117
Yes, it's done.\nWhether it will work or not is different ....

ID=100465118
Hun. There is no mistake in the technology I developed.\nYou have different dimensions from the Vesi.

ID=100465119
Well ... I will be in trouble if I get together.\nI do not have the noble nature to put my companion at ease.

ID=100465120
... Hmm. There is no success without sacrifice.

ID=100465121
I agree with that.\nBy the way, valuable things you got sacrificed for your friends\nWhat should I define who will sell to the enemy?

ID=100465122
......

ID=100465123
Well, good.\nThanks to that traitor,\nOur possibilities have also expanded ....

ID=100465124
How is his condition?

ID=100465125
Not bad ... No, it's rather good.\nThe figure that is so tight is what I see after a long time.

ID=100465126
... I doubt if I needed to do that far.

ID=100465127
Hun, have you noticed scare now?\nTo the habit of Vesi.

ID=100465128
... Be careful with the words.\nI only crossed the hand for the purpose with you.

ID=100465129
If it seems to be useless more than that ....\nYou can silence me with your strength?

ID=100465130
......

ID=100465131
Oh, I was scared.\nTo human beings ....

ID=100465132
... Hun.\nGo for the final adjustment.

ID=100465133
Yes it is.\nGood luck to the end. A traitor who is a man.

ID=100465134
......

ID=100465135
......

ID=100465136
If this is ... our way ....\nThere is no choice but to go ....

ID=510047001
It looks like it has ended.\nA newcomer, it was a pain.

ID=410047001
... Scar.\nIt is a foolish person.

ID=210047501
I wanted a source of your power to surpass you.\nAs a result, Vesi and Soul Energy coexisted.

ID=210047502
I wanted power until I threw away pride and all of myself ....\nOn the contrary it became an enemy, and I lost to you again.

ID=210047503
There is a thing that should never be thrown away.\nScark decided to be defeated when he wanted human power ....

ID=210047504
But ... to show respect for that will.\nEven though I abandoned myself, it is the strength of my desire to defeat the enemy.

ID=210047505
Oh, that.\nIt looks like a fool but is it cool?

ID=210047506
Well, I can say that as well.

ID=210047507
Anyway, it was a hard time, a new entry.\nIf I get caught, it will be overtaken soon.

ID=210047508
Huh ~. Cain, will you lose your job ~?

ID=210047509
Hmm ... that is not bad with that.

ID=210047510
Well, if Cain went unemployed, I will quit my job.\nWould you like to go on a trip together?

ID=210047511
Well then, then, go with them alone ... ....\nWhen coming back ... Well ... I will come home by three people ... How is it?

ID=210047512
...? What?\nThree people?

ID=210047513
... What are you talking about?

ID=210047514
Ah ~ well, it's really insensitive ~.

ID=210047515
What? What?

ID=210047516
I do not know. You can touch it even in Seoul Weapon for the rest of your life ~!\nWhy is it this way ... I ~! I will sleep anymore!

ID=210047517
(Seduilin has gone with a bad look)

ID=210047518
I can not understand the situation at all.\nDid you say something bad?

ID=210047519
......

ID=210047520
Well, that's about it.\nIt will quench naturally.

ID=210047521
In any case, what you have returned seems to be spreading in Grace City.\nIt is about time that Jeremy is coming.

ID=210047522
Yes! Did you call? What?

ID=210047523
...?\nWhat is this time, Jeremy.

ID=210047524
Ah ... Er ... ha ha.\nIt seems like sending me something from Dr. Sedulin ... like being told ....

ID=210047525
... Well good.\nFinish soon. Wait a while.

ID=210047526
Yes, yes!\nThank you!

ID=210047527
I am ... a serious fellow.

ID=210047528
Do not forget, new.\nWhen the heart breaks up, it means that everything is over.

ID=210047529
We use the strength of our heart as a force ....\nWhatever difficulties may hurt ... keep your heart strong!

ID=210047530
Is it a way to keep in mind ...?\nHmmm ... can only say that you will not lose sight of yourself.

ID=210047531
If you feel like losing yourself ... ask your colleagues for help.\nPresence that supports you ... Because that is a friend.

ID=210047532
... I've talked about it for a long time.\nGo to Jeremy's place soon.

ID=610047501
It was a hard time, a new entry.

ID=310047501
Go to Jeremy.\nHut ... It is not a bad thing that there are any fans.

ID=100475101
Thank you for your hard work.\nActivities have heard.

ID=100475102
With only one scar that absorbed Seoul Energy for 300 people!\nYou should leave this achievement as a song! !

ID=100475103
I will make it if no one makes it!\nWhat is the title "Battle of the Soul ~ Soul Memory ~" How! What?

ID=100475104
Melody is ....\nWell, I guess.

ID=100475105
... To be honest, I envy you.\nTo foreigners and soul workers until now,\nI never had such a feeling.

ID=100475106
But, strong will like you and the power to accomplish it.\nI am sincerely wondering if I have it.

ID=100475107
I know that. I have no strong will or power ....\nThat is why I will be fascinated by the light that you shoot.

ID=100475108
I think that Jeremy feels the same way.\nI think that it is a feeling like seeing a hero yet though ....

ID=100475109
... Please stay with us as our hero.\nA lot of people are paying attention to you.

ID=100475110
We are the hero's step.

ID=100475111
Emilito ....\nWhat's wrong with being suddenly changed?

ID=100475112
... Anything.\nLet's do the work.

ID=100475113
Okay! Organize the list and grasp the supplies!

ID=100475114
OK, let's clean up quickly.

ID=100475115
So ...%username%.\nSee you again.

ID=100475116
see you!

ID=100475117


ID=100475118
Damn it ... theoretically it should be perfect ...!\nWhat on earth is the problem! What?

ID=100475119
Hey, the woman of Vesi!\nDid he do not succeed? What?

ID=100475120
... I wonder if having suspicion on my own power is a defeat.\nIron 's will has melted ... ....

ID=100475121
I surely recognized it as an enemy ... ....\nIt is not my own power, but a force of a different world ....

ID=100475122
I wonder if the area can not be reached by force alone ...\nAfter all ... if you can not understand each other perfectly ....

ID=100475123
What are you saying wastefully! The experiment is a failure!\nWhat is this zama while clapping a big mouth!

ID=100475124
Still, human beings.

ID=100475125
Fucking, but the data was getting enough.\nGive me the next experimental body! Next time!

ID=100475126
It's fine already.

ID=100475127
What did you say?

ID=100475128
The deal is here.\nYou have already used it.

ID=100475129
Here, this amateur ...!

ID=100475130
Oh, do you want to die?\nPlease disappear quickly.

ID=100475131
Who accepts such unilateral deletion of trade ...!

ID=100475132
Get outta quickly!

ID=100475133
...! !

ID=100475134
... Remember!\nI will definitely return this borrowed!

ID=100475135
......

ID=100475136
Fuu ....

ID=100475137
I promised ... I did not die.

ID=100475138
... That idiot.

ID=510047501
It was a wonderful activity.\nI can not help admitting you this time as well.

ID=410047502
You seem to have been right answers left to you.\nI, the Starry Forest Alliance ... well.

ID=210048001
The betrayal of Henry was finalized, as a result of proceeding with the Ned Company,\nI found an interesting fact.

ID=210048002
We Ned Company keeps track of the whereabouts of executives from time to time.\nBy high performance GPS you can see where you are doing ... as you pick up.

ID=210048003
Because it is a company with high confidentiality, it is essential for security reasons ....\nIn effect, it is nothing different from monitoring.

ID=210048004
Henry 's loyalty to the Ned Company was also famous within the organization.\nAs a result, it seems that monitoring of traveling routes and so on has become somewhat sweet.

ID=210048005
However, as a result of pursuing Henry's past movements,\nI concentrated on some strange coordinates.

ID=210048006
Although abnormal points are not seen in the corresponding coordinates,\nHe has been visiting once a month since about two years ago.\nAs a result of the Ned Company surveying its coordinates in earnest ....

ID=210048007
The headquarters of Rapid Flame was found at the relevant point.

ID=210048008
When scanning on the satellite, the unique wavelength emitted by Vesi,\nA lot of Desire Energy was perceived.

ID=210048009
The number is about 1000.\nIt is almost the same number as all the forces of Rapid Flame being confirmed.

ID=210048010
Currently, the Ned Company is in the suppression of Rapid Flame\nI mobilize all the fighting strength and are running around.

ID=210048011
A great opportunity is now to find the home of Rapid Flame which was enveloped in a mystery ....\nThe Ned Company is preparing a surprise attack strategy by raising all the power.

ID=210048012
However, it seems that it will take about 3 days to prepare.\nBecause we are attracting mercenaries and voluntary forces scattered all over the crowdream ....

ID=210048013
......

ID=210048014
It is the first win.

ID=210048015
The Star Forest Alliance is based on the army.\nThe speed of concentration of troops will overwhelm the Ned Company.

ID=210048016
Also, considering the strategy of surprise attacks, now only by Grace City's military force\nI think there is enough victory.

ID=210048017
Ned Company is planning to solidify the foundation in Crow Dream based on this surprise attack strategy.\nThis will doubt the existence of the Star Forest Union.

ID=210048018
The Star Forest Association succeeded in raid the base of Rapid Flame forces first,\nIf you make a big achievement you will get support to overwhelm the Ned Company.

ID=210048019
I will leave the decision.\nBut do not forget that you do not have much time.

ID=210048020
......

ID=210048021
This is my courtesy for trusting me and for helping Emilite.

ID=210048022
Well then, please pick it up soon.

ID=210048023
As it's a sensitive period, if I can see where I am talking to people in the Star Forest Union\nI will not say a good thing.

ID=610048001
I transferred the corresponding coordinates to you.\nWell then ....

ID=310048001
......

ID=100480101
... Did you find the home of Rapid Flame?\nDoes Ned Company ...?

ID=100480102
Did you discover it during Henry pursuit?\nWell, that pig is useful as well.

ID=100480103
However, it is bad to move poorly.\n"Do not rush hurt things" would you say?

ID=100480104
It seems to be Marriage deki.\nRecently it is not so, but it was hard to accept from around us long ago ....

ID=100480105
... You do not have to worry about that person's remarks.\nAnyway, I will check with satellite scan.

ID=100480106
Wait a moment as it will be over soon.

ID=100480107
Alright. Meanwhile, I have something I want to talk with your guardian.

ID=100480108
You must have been busy since you came to Grace City, did not you?\nTo be honest, there were some uncertainties at the beginning, but ...

ID=100480109
Cooperating with excellent operators, they successfully repulsed the commander of Rapid Flame ....\nI have no intention of clamoring, but I did it very well.

ID=100480110
I think I understand, but I will not be arrogant ....\nIt is not too late even after winning fifty thousand times, it will not be Gorman. Ha ha ha.

ID=100480111
... In the past, there were soul workers similar to yours.\nOverflowing talent, strong spirit, pure will ....

ID=100480112
But he confidence in his power ... he stepped into the forbidden territory.\nAs a result, we lost the strongest soul workers of the past.

ID=100480113
Such a tragedy never comes again.\nMay yours always forget your humility ....

ID=100480114
To talk bored, is not it like a commander?

ID=100480115
"The story that will be for Mr. Tall" is here.\nIf you think that you are bored, do not pick how to get rich years.

ID=100480116
Whew ... ....\nOh, keep us waiting. I got a scan result.

ID=100480117
Rafer, you know.\nThis Desire Energy ... It's no mistake as a home.

ID=100480118
I forcibly raised the resolution, but I could check up to the silhouette.\nIt is confirmed.

ID=100480119
I can get such precious information.\nAs it is, personal connections are important.

ID=100480120
If that is the case, you will not get lost.\nImmediately start a surprise attack strategy.

ID=100480121
Focus on all the troops and make it a one-shot wreck.\nYour request to Rocotown and Candas City for assistance!

ID=100480122
To Loco Town and Canduscity ...?\nI think that it is impossible.

ID=100480123
Even if it is impossible.\nFor security reasons, we can not exchange with radio waves. Just as your direct oral presents.

ID=100480124
Now, I will hurry.\nIt is a match between us and you, whichever is early!

ID=100480125
... Do as you like.

ID=510048001
%username%?\nWhat's wrong, suddenly ....

ID=510048002
I heard the story that he is in Grace City.\nYou seem to be active.

ID=410048001
... It is that you are here with active work ... ... here.\nIs there something important for you?

ID=210048501
Military support?\nAre you trying to attack the home of Rapid Flame?

ID=210048502
Alright. So soon ....

ID=210048503
... I'd like to help but the situation is not that bad.

ID=210048504
Just handling the dolls left by the clowns of the blue flame is a situation that is too much for me.\nA doll factory and an estimated place are also found and are under investigation.

ID=210048505
I would like to support but in that case Rocotown will be in danger.

ID=210048506
It's bad ... support for troops seems to be difficult.

ID=610048501
I am sorry I can not become a force.\nI know what's important, but ... I can not abandon this place.

ID=310048501
Larry Colonel Aaron can not expect too much, but it would be nice to talk.

ID=100485101
%username%?\nWhat's wrong? Have you been released to Kandus city? Oh my goodness, Ahaha.

ID=100485102
... Request for support of troops?\nDid you find the home of Rapid Flame?

ID=100485103
... It is very good news, but it is hard to support.

ID=100485104
... After one case of Katherine, there was also a large amount of military replenishment by headquarters.

ID=100485105
It does not mean there is no military force to use,\nIt's a bit strict in the current situation.

ID=100485106
Colonel Aaron.\nWe are ready for incineration.

ID=100485107
How is the siege situation?

ID=100485108
No problem.\nAfter 2 hours you can completely surround.

ID=100485109
After that, you just put in Napalm.\nWith this, all soul junk near the residence will be annihilated.

ID=100485110
Struggling.\nThe strategy is almost successful, but it is still early to rest. Do not be discouraged.

ID=100485111
Laura is a lieutenant.\nSoul junk opponent ... I do not care for you.

ID=100485112
No matter how victory is sure ....\nIt is until it crushes thoroughly. Not a single animal ....

ID=100485113
It is reassuring.\nHow about the situation in the vicinity of N - 102?

ID=100485114
New weapons are active.\nIt was more than I expected, as I had only gigantic soul junk warfare in mind.

ID=100485115
Can you annihilate it?

ID=100485116
Yes, please leave it to me.\nBy entering N - 102, by closing the exit and activating the new weapon ....

ID=100485117
......

ID=100485118
You understand?

ID=100485119
This is the situation now.

ID=100485120
I'm poured into Seoul Junk sweeping strategy with all the supplemented troops.\nAnd ... I've gotten enough results to see an example so far.

ID=100485121
Thanks to the huge soul junk weapons and tactics that JVC turned on,\nKandas city's soul junk is almost destroyed.

ID=100485122
... There are no more scholars to be immersed in the study of soul junk.\nNow I am familiar with the habits and characteristics of Soul Junk ... Professional of annihilation for Soul junk.

ID=100485123
Mr. Chief of the College ... I have been devoting my full strength to Seoul Junk 's elimination since that one case.\nIt may not be understood from the side, but it has changed. ... enough for the spine to freeze.

ID=100485124
Both of us ... to take revenge ... for Katherine.

ID=100485125
......

ID=100485126
... Then, return to your mission.

ID=100485127
There is nothing we can do now. So go back to Grace City.

ID=100485128
... sorry.

ID=100485201
Hmm ... It is as expected, but it is a result that I can not afford to see.

ID=100485202
Locotown was originally a bad place ....\nKandashii is honestly surprising. Colonel Aaron ...

ID=100485203
Lose your family ....\nThat feeling, I do not know, but ....

ID=100485204
It can not be helped.\nI will hit Rapid Flame with all the troops of Grace City.

ID=100485205
I have enough to win.\nIf you hit the front it is equally good, but if it is a surprise attack there is minutes here.

ID=100485206
Let's start with that.

ID=100485207
Yes.

ID=510048501
Jeremy. What about checking medical supplies?

ID=510048502
It's over!\nFood?

ID=510048503
no problem.\nAfter that, it's only checking bullets and protective equipment.

ID=510048504
I will do bullets. Jeremy asks for checks on protection equipment.

ID=510048505
Okay!

ID=410048501
Hmm?\nOh, welcome back.

ID=210049001
I'm preparing for a surprise attack.\nI am arranging to send only the minimum amount of goods.

ID=210049002
Due to time, goods can not be divided finely according to categories.\nFor the time being, it is in a state classified in the upper category ....

ID=210049003
This can not be determined instantaneously unless it is a battle support personnel.\nSo Jeremy and I and I went to the site directly.

ID=210049004
... be careful.\nWe will do our best, too ....

ID=210049005
So, we are around here ....\nJeremy, let's go.

ID=210049006
Yup!\n%username%! Also at the scene!

ID=100490101
Well, somewhat Grace City is noisy.\nSince when was it such a move?

ID=100490102
Oh, I will also participate in this operation.\nWell, it is with you.

ID=100490103
Ahaha, I'm looking forward to it.\nI can accompany rumored soul workers ....

ID=100490104
To be released for a moment from the boredom amulet,\nIt is unbelievable luck.

ID=100490105
......

ID=100490106
Let's hurry.\nThe attack and support forces departed ahead of the other.

ID=100490107
Kimi to me is the core of our strength.\nAfterwards, I only have a surprise attack on Rapid Flame.

ID=100490108
The confluence point is a city whose development was canceled.\nI wish I could be a convenience store on the way.\nRecently my hungry is empty. Ahaha.

ID=510049001
... It was done.

ID=410049001
There is no appearance of lift.\nI do not know where I went.

ID=210049501
... You mean that you have been swayed by Ned guys.\nI had to fix my mind ... I was too optimistic about the situation.

ID=210049502
Active attitude toward Henry search,\nCooperation to us ... it seems that everything was acting.

ID=210049503
Perhaps Ned Company and Rapid Flame have been hands from long ago.\nI'm not interested in trading, but the problem is that we are the reason for our alliance.

ID=210049504
Well, it probably was an eyesore.\nRapid Flame, of course, from the Ned\nWe interfere with the control of our guys.

ID=210049505
... What is the damage situation?

ID=210049506
The original attacking unit wiped out ... ....\nThere are only a few of the operation support units left.

ID=210049507
... hasten their rescue.

ID=210049508
The surprise attack is totally failure.\nInformation leaked, becoming a rat mouse, we were devastated.

ID=210049509
Chasing after the Ned Company is postponement.\nNow, the rescue of survivors is given priority.

ID=210049510
SOS is appearing everywhere up to newcomers and gathering areas.\nToward rescuing survivors with Roy.

ID=210049511
Rescuing survivors is the top priority now.\nI can not put any more victims.

ID=210049512
... Revenge, then.

ID=610049501
Quickly! noob!

ID=310049501
Rescuing survivors is a top priority!\nRevenge ... postponement.

ID=100495101
... Everyone died.\nI do not know the reason ... Uooh ...!

ID=100495102
What is a surprise attack!\nAmbush ... Everyone ... Uoo ...!

ID=100495103
Why is it such a thing ....\nThe Star Forest Association is already over.

ID=100495104
I do not want war ... I'm sorry.\nEveryone die anyway ... Everyone ....

ID=510049501
Do you really want to go?

ID=410049501
Well ... I guess there is no chance of winning though, no matter how I think ~.

ID=210050001
I will hold back for more.\nBecause it is because there is life ....\nI am not as strong as you are.

ID=210050002
Instead, please leave it behind.\nPrevent Rapid Flame here so that it will not be attacked.\nPlease go to the destination. [M]

ID=210050003
The strength of that will ... I will see ....

ID=610050001
Please rescue the survivors and come back safely.

ID=610050002
Please head towards your destination.\nIf there are survivors, it should be there ....

ID=310050001
Please turn to the meeting place.\nIf there are survivors there is only there.

ID=510050001
D, Emilito ...!\nEmilito! ! ! !

ID=510050002
Get up, hey ...!\nOpen your eyes!

ID=410050001
Uu ... Uooah ah! !

ID=210050501
......

ID=210050502
......\n......

ID=210050503
... Why now ....

ID=210050504
I was waiting forever!\nHow come now ...!

ID=210050505
Emilito ... Wait a moment ...!\nBecause help will come soon, only a little more ... to endure!

ID=210050506
Why did not you come ...?\nWhy did you leave us alone!

ID=210050507
......

ID=210050508
It is because of you ....

ID=210050509
Even you ....\nI have to come even you, such a thing did not happen! !

ID=210050510
Even Emiliept may die.\nYou ... you killed ...!

ID=210050511
You killed Emilito!

ID=210050512
Lie! Lie!\nThis lie is attached!

ID=210050513
Yo ... well I betrayed you ...!\nI believed you ...!

ID=210050514
traitor ....\nI will never forgive you ....

ID=210050515
go.\nI will never see that face again.

ID=210050516
... Get out faster!

ID=610050501
(... go home)

ID=310050501
Emilito ....

ID=100505101
... It was a hard time.

ID=100505102
Jeremy is currently being treated.\nThe wounds are not deep. It is about bruises.

ID=100505103
But ... It seems that he is mentally ill.\nIt seems that meal does not pass throat.

ID=100505104
The mourning of the men who lost their lives was over.\n... including Emilito.

ID=100505105
It was said that the enemy was being danced ....\nAs a commander, I have committed an irreparable loss.

ID=100505106
That does not mean there is a depressed cast.\nIt can be said that everywhere is the same situation now.

ID=100505107
Oh, of course.\nI am sorry even for the time he is lamenting.

ID=100505108
The dead man will not return anymore. Do you live or die?\nIt may be cruel, but that is reality.

ID=100505109
What we should do is "revenge for them" ... only that.\nPreparation for that is progressing steadily.

ID=100505110
At the place where Rapid Flame is home from Laufer\nSensed heat source ... It turned out that everything was decoy.

ID=100505111
Traces of causing the crosstalk by the electronic signal should be left.\nIn short ... It is said that there are places that hacked.

ID=100505112
I'll pin down there and crush it without any trace.

ID=100505113
It will take some time before the preparation is over.\nUntil then, you should also organize your feelings.

ID=100505114
... If you are concerned about Jeremy's situation, go to Sora.

ID=100505201
Jeremy ... is that?

ID=100505202
It is not good. I will not take a meal ... I will not talk.\nI just stared at the air.

ID=100505203
Mental shock was great.\n... There is no impossibility. Emilito who had been as adorous as that ....

ID=100505204
... I heard that Jeremy had a bad thing to say.\nI do not say that you understand forcibly.\nBut please be aware that it is not a bad child.

ID=100505205
Previous Jeremy was a child who was not confident of himself.\nHowever, I met Emilito and changed.

ID=100505206
He said that he met a person who can withdraw his true self.\nJeremy changed visibly after I met Emilito.\nOf course, in a good way ....

ID=100505207
And I met you.\nFor Jeremy is the second hero.

ID=100505208
But ... one of the heroes will not make it in time,\nThe other person died surprisingly at ease.

ID=100505209
Jeremy, who faced the toughest reality,\nI had no choice but to direct someone with hatred ....\nIf I did not do it, I could not bear it very much.

ID=100505210
I can not afford to hate the person who lost my life ....\nJeremy had no choice but to hurt you.

ID=100505211
So ... please do not feel bad about Jeremy.

ID=100505212
Now ... I can only wait for the time to pass.\nUntil Jeremy heals his wounds and tears himself ....

ID=100505213
He is a strong child.\nThis situation will surely be overcome.

ID=100505214
Emilito is sure to think so.\nIf there is another world ....\nEmilito must have Jeremy ....

ID=100505215
... Ah ... that? Tears are ....\nI'm sorry, I ... GOOTSU ....

ID=100505216
I'm sorry.\nI do not wanna cry ... I'm trying to cry ... ....

ID=100505217
... Gusut ... ....\nWell, to talk about that ... the operation officer was looking for it.\nThere seems to be something I want to tell you.

ID=100505218
Look, quickly ... Goo ... Please go hurry ...!\nCrying ... she is embarrassed ... ....

ID=510050501
You came.\nNow, prepare.

ID=410050501
I found the home of Ned guys.

ID=210051001
I found a trace of hacking the satellite.\nI guess I thought I had disappeared all the time, but we are specialists on that road.

ID=210051002
As a result of reverse detection, the hacked place is a canyon in the outskirts of Grace City.\nNo matter what, it's a place called tactical name "Area 9".

ID=210051003
Because it is quite spacious,\nIt was a search operation that put in Kane Barrel as well as Roy, too.

ID=210051004
I have searched for it randomly until now, but I gradually narrow down the scope.\nFrom now on, there is a high possibility that there are facilities of Ned Company in the area you go.

ID=210051005
Go as soon as you are ready.

ID=610051001
Ned's guys ... I got on a bit too much.

ID=310051001
Go to area 9 and proceed with the search strategy.

ID=510051001
I wonder if it was better to say that it is the secret base of Ned Company.\nAnyway, I found you.

ID=410051001
Later ... just attach the claws.

ID=210051501
There is no problem opening the gate.\nBecause I can hack within 5 minutes.

ID=210051502
The problem is what is inside ....\nThere is no doubt that there are mercenaries hired by Ned Company ....

ID=210051503
There is a high possibility that Laufer and Henry are inside.

ID=210051504
Then there is only a way to scan the internal facilities with the satellite,\nIt is more troubling than I thought.

ID=210051505
Interfering radio waves are too strong,\nFar from scanning the internal facility, I can not even grasp the force.

ID=210051506
The interior is quite spacious.\nI think it is difficult for you alone to find Rafer and Henry.

ID=210051507
So, I asked Cedulin for one.

ID=210051508
Since we are informing everything from the outline of this strategy to the execution method,\nTry going to Sedulin.

ID=610051501
If you understand the strategy, you do not mind rushing in soon.

ID=310051501
I informed Cedulin about this strategy.\nPlease ask explanation from her.

ID=100515101
I will not explain it only once, so listen properly ~.\nI am sleepy now, I feel sleepy ... ... Fah.

ID=100515102
Well, that's an EMP bomb.\nAs the name says, EMP will spread around if installed.

ID=100515103
It's easy to use ~. Just push the button on the ground.\nAfter that the machine will will without without permission ... ... ふ ぁ.

ID=100515104
What? EMP ~? Oh, that is it ~.\nIt is a type of shock wave that completely disables the machine.

ID=100515105
Well, it will be troublesome if we are ineffective to internal facilities ~ are you?\nSo reverse detection of jamming waves and only the machine transmitting that radio wave\nI adjusted it to neutralize ~.

ID=100515106
What did you do ~? Ahaha, you do not understand even if you explain?\nIf you install it at various places in secret base, you can suppress jamming waves ~.\nWell then, thank you for your consideration ~.

ID=100515107
Fua ... after all it is hard to remodel the person's thing ~.\nThere are many things to worry about, I will not go forward ~!

ID=100515108
Well, let's do my best!\nI am good night ~.

ID=510051501
OK, the strategy is complete.\n... I wonder why I understood it?

ID=510051502
Because the inside of the secret base became scanable.\nYou can not hide anything anymore.

ID=410051501
Ned Company's secret base is already as naked.

ID=410051502
Well, hungry wolves!\nTake over the bare base, one bolt ... all over nuts!

ID=410051503
... Wow ....

ID=210052001
As a result of investigating the interior of the secret base all the way,\nI caught a few life reactions.

ID=210052002
Among them, three reactions left the secret base.\nLooking at the speed of movement, it seems that you are on a thing like a shuttle.

ID=210052003
I got a bit of a problem,\nFortunately Henry and Rafer 's reactions are still there.

ID=210052004
So what do you need to do ....

ID=210052005
It is to add sanctions to traitors.

ID=210052006
Now, new.\nIt is time to make a fine penalty.

ID=610052001
Mercy is useless. Grinding without mercy.

ID=610052002
Mercilessly ...?\nIt is terrible.

ID=610052003
......

ID=610052004


ID=610052005
Chic. That's it.\nIt seems that you have looked at the Star Forest Alliance sweetly.

ID=610052006
More than this ... ....\nI have no choice but to use my back.

ID=610052007
Laban, get up.

ID=610052008
......

ID=610052009
It is a turn.

ID=610052010
......

ID=310052001
I will give the traitor a justice hammer ...!\nDedicate the weight of sin!

ID=510052001
......

ID=410052001
Did you come ...?

ID=210052501
......

ID=210052502
... I was trying to make a new world.

ID=210052503
The more prolonged the situation that two gigantic powers can not be one,\nYou will not be able to overcome the existence of a different world gradually ....

ID=210052504
So, first of all, trying to make people one.\nThat's why I sold you to Ned Company.

ID=210052505
... In that choice ... I did not have any hesitancy.

ID=210052506
but ....

ID=210052507
No way, Emilito ....

ID=210052508
... I am ... it is as good as killed.

ID=210052509
It was not worth getting up at the expense of an important friend ....\nI do not know until now ....

ID=210052510
......

ID=210052511
I am sorry ....\ntruly ....

ID=210052512
... I will not tell you to forgive me.\nBut please help only the life.

ID=210052513
Even though I take a lifetime ... I will compensate for my sins.\nTo the Emilit ... Jeremy, and ... sins for you.

ID=210052514
I promise.\nSo ... only this life.

ID=610052501
Please ... receive this.\nIt is the key of a secret room.

ID=610052502
With this you should see Henry ....

ID=310052501
Emilito ....\nSorry ... I'm sorry ....

ID=510053001
It's a near soul worker ...?\nIt is what made ridiculous things.

ID=410053001
Anyway, I had a hard time.

ID=210053501
In this regard, Ned Company has become our enemy completely.\nIt is a pity that he missed Henry, but he will be able to catch it soon.

ID=210053502
Anything "Entitled Independence Unit ESP" and "Monitoring Force Orca"\nI'm keeping track of Henry.

ID=210053503
Are those two troops ...?\nHow long have you been in for a year?

ID=210053504
Mochi rice cake shop ... leave it to an expert.\nTherefore, you are to be unlocked for Henry pursuit.

ID=210053505
By the way, I told you about the three shuttles fired from the secret base.\nThe result of collating the wavelength of energy sensed inside the shuttle ... ....

ID=210053506
It turned out to be the wavelength of the near soul worker.\nIn other words, there are three or more near soul workers.

ID=210053507
Your mission is tracking and securing near soul workers.

ID=610053501
I kept inform Kain Barrel of the tracking place.\nTakashi carry out this strategy with him.

ID=610053502
It is a dangerous task, but do not worry if you are a guard.\nYou will come back safely.

ID=610053503
It was a pain, it was new.\nSee you later.

ID=310053501
Why do not you say a greeting to your friends before entering the next strategy.

ID=100535101
Oh, new!\nWhat impression did you fight with near soul workers?\nHow was it compared to Seoul workers?

ID=100535102
Interesting, huh ~. Is it a soul worker made artificially?

ID=100535103
Anyway, what are the Ned Company going to do?\nIt is also the movement to control soul junk,\nNow it's time to create soul workers ....

ID=100535104
I do not know. I guess you are also planning to conquer the world ... Fuwa ....

ID=100535105
Anyway, that new soul collapsed that near soul worker ....

ID=100535106
It is Laban. Doctor.

ID=100535107
Oh, that's right. Laban has decided to manage it for the moment.\nThere are many pilings to investigate ... his mental state is not good ~.

ID=100535108
Laban 's mental condition management and care was left to me.

ID=100535109
Currently, I do not see the hostile will,\nIt is in a state of confinement in a room of a special specification in case of emergency.

ID=100535110
As a result of surveying the brain waves, it was a serious brainwashing condition.\nRather than having fought with their own will,\nIt seems that "ability" to refuse the order was lost.

ID=100535111
First of all, it is the first decision to solve the brainwashing state.\nAfter that, we are planning to investigate Dr. Sedulin.

ID=100535112
That 's right ~. Biological experiments are special to me ~.

ID=100535113
... Doctor. Do not say such a thing in a joke.

ID=100535114
It seems to track the remaining near soul workers.\nBy the time I get back, I think that you can do conversation as much as possible.

ID=100535115
Sora, motivated manga ~.

ID=100535116
In a sense, it is a chance for promotion!\nBesides, he is a very good guy ... Huhu.

ID=100535117
......

ID=510053501
I was waiting.

ID=510053502
I have heard the story from Roy.\nI am leaving Grace City for a while.

ID=410053501
That's a shame.\nI wanted to talk to you more ....

ID=210054001
I do not know much what you are doing,\nI clearly remember what motivated me and I was motivated.

ID=210054002
I will not listen to what the body says now ....\nSomeday, I will also walk my own way with this foot.

ID=210054003
How about that?\nDoes such a day come?

ID=210054004
Roy ... What do you want to say ...?

ID=210054005
Nothing in particular.\nAnyway, we will meet again soon ....

ID=210054006
... I see.\nWould you mind telling me a story before departure?

ID=210054007
There was a time when I was burning with such a sense of mission.\nI tried to save a lot of people by making good use of my ability.

ID=210054008
At that time, there was always a woman on my side.\nAs if a woman like a incarnation of a woman ... ....

ID=210054009
I am always dignified, absolutely will not bend my will ....\nIt was a wonderful woman.

ID=210054010
She and I have joined forces and overcome many adversities.\nAnd each time I felt that the bond between them was deepening.

ID=210054011
Meanwhile, I suddenly started to have doubts on my way.\nI do not remember details ... I think that there was some chance.

ID=210054012
Along with the passage of time, the gap between my path and her path grew bigger.\nAnd she is ....

ID=210054013
One day, I burned me with a whitish flame.\nThis scar was made at that time.

ID=210054014
it was beautiful ....\nEven at that moment when this life is about to be lost,\nThe flame that was shining without disturbance of one point ... It looked too beautiful.

ID=210054015
... I do not hate her.\nRather it was noticed at that time.

ID=210054016
She turned her back, to punish her weak will,\nHe is a judge who came down from heaven ....

ID=210054017
I do not know what she is doing right now.\nBut, one sure thing ....\nThat she is making progress with her own will.

ID=210054018
I can not lose.\nIn order to meet her again ... I can not stop this step.

ID=210054019
......

ID=210054020
Looking at your figure,\nI got the courage to walk forward again.

ID=210054021
... It is almost time.\nI am also looking forward to seeing you.

ID=610054001
(Greeting parting with Nave, Roy)

ID=610054002


ID=610054003
......

ID=610054004
......

ID=610054005
... It's strange.

ID=610054006
... What is it?

ID=610054007
You, surprisingly you can not lie, right?

ID=610054008
Unexpectedly ...?\nHey, Roy ... I have never lied.

ID=610054009
Hmm ... that is a lie.

ID=610054010
By the way, have you heard that the number is small?

ID=610054011
Is that so?\nI think that I am a crowd of people ....

ID=610054012
You ... I guess you really can not grasp it.

ID=610054013
Fuh ... I did not think it would be said from Roy.

ID=610054014
......

ID=610054015
Anyway, in various meanings ....\nI am looking forward to seeing you again.

ID=610054016
Well ... It's a boring life, I want to live with fun.

ID=610054017
......\nRoy, did not you say you have any errands?

ID=610054018
Oops, I was careless.\nWell, I guess soon ....

ID=610054019
Do not forsake rough copies again.

ID=610054020
Aw Do I look like that type?\nDo not worry.

ID=100540101
Late, new.\nAre you going to end the day with just greeting?

ID=100540102
You and me are heading for tracking and securing near soul workers from now.

ID=100540103
The strategy development area is Ruin Fortress.\nIt is a former military fortress of Ned Company that is now ruined.

ID=100540104
I will tell you the details as I arrive again.\nI will move.

ID=100540105


ID=100540106
... It seems that he failed again.

ID=100540107
No!\nBut it was not at all ...!

ID=100540108
It seems that Laban was robbed and other guys fled.\nIf this is not a failure, what are you saying ...?

ID=100540109
......

ID=100540110
... Your mistake is not beginning now.\nI do not feel like ruining my voice anymore.

ID=100540111
Is the harvest only information that Seoul Energy can be injected into Vesi ...?\nIt is valuable information, but the problem is that there is no hitting next ....

ID=100540112
How is the direction of Seoul Junk?

ID=100540113
... After A Amaryllis, especially the big progress ....\nWith no samples in handy ....

ID=100540114
Hmm, was it impossible in Beholda ...?\nAgain, there seems to be a limit in artificial soul junk.

ID=100540115
Then there is only one method left.\nHenry.

ID=100540116
Yes, yes! !

ID=100540117
Capture the original.

ID=100540118
I say o, original ... ....\nWell, no way!

ID=100540119
That's it ....\nAim for "Queen".

ID=100540120
......! !

ID=100540121
Whatever sacrifice you do ... secure it.

ID=100540122
Well ... but ...!

ID=100540123
But what ...?

ID=100540124
No, no ... nothing.

ID=100540125
... It will not be disturbed so far by only one soul worker ....\nIt's good with Amaryllis' case, this case's good ... It looks like a troublesome guy got into it.

ID=100540126
Interesting ... but a little eyesore.

ID=100540127
Right now I have no choice but to see ....\nIf ... that time you judged it could be a real threat ....

ID=100540128
......

ID=100540129


ID=100540130


ID=100540131
......

ID=100540132
Hey, Jeremy?

ID=100540133
......

ID=100540134
... I do not eat after all.\nThis ... only 30 pieces a day? You bought it side by side.

ID=100540135
......

ID=100540136
... Fuu. Right on.\nBe sure to call me when I'm hungry later.

ID=100540137
......

ID=100540138
... Well.

ID=100540139
......

ID=100540140
......

ID=100540141
... ... Emilito ....

ID=100540142
Oops. Haha, is not it a terrible summer? Jeremy.

ID=100540143
...!

ID=100540144
......

ID=100540145
......

ID=100540146
Is not he a different person?

ID=100540147
You can not see the smiling face and the brain's weather as well?\nMy eyes are completely dead. Ahaha.

ID=100540148
Is not it better now?\nTo be honest, you used to be an insecticide before you. Ahaha!

ID=100540149
......

ID=100540150
......

ID=100540151
Jeremy.

ID=100540152
Do you want power?

ID=100540153
"Chapter 3: Torn Ideal"\nComplete.

ID=510054001
......

ID=410054001
Oh ... come home.

ID=260064501
Hey, it's nice to hear your voice again.\nI was worried that he would run away, but he seems to be thinking too much.

ID=260064502
The target of this time is a code name "Wild Beak".\nIt's like a bird with a sharp beak and nails.

ID=260064503
There seems to be no way for the members to do a quick attack from the air.

ID=260064504
So, like last time, I would like to ask you to annihilate 'Wild Beak'.

ID=260064505
How about? Will you do it?

ID=660064501
I appreciate prompt reply.\nHa ha ha. I expect you.

ID=660064502
Then be careful.

ID=360064501
This time it is the annihilation of the codename "Wild Beak".\nDo not let your guard down.

ID=560064501
It was a hard time.\nYou seem to have done well this time.

ID=560064502
I am anxious about it. It is hard work for you.

ID=560064503
Actually, I got off the commander from Toll\nI was told to concentrate on treatment, but it is not quite so.

ID=560064504
This is the world.\nThere are many worries etc.

ID=460064501
Although I will increase the ability to borrow from now on, I beg you.

ID=260065001
I was waiting.\nI have a favor to ask.

ID=260065002
Do you know the code name "Red Food"?

ID=260065003
Hmm, it seems that you are still shallow Do not know.\nNo, I am sorry. My question was bad.

ID=260065004
What is important is the future.

ID=260065005
The codename "Red Food" said now,\nIt is the smallest Vesi in Rapid Flame appearing on the highway.

ID=260065006
At first glance it looks weak, but its agility and collective behaviorality will never be revealed.

ID=260065007
As a feature, I said that it is a red cloak with a small body.

ID=260065008
That "Red Food" frequently appears on the highway\nIt seems that members are burning hands.

ID=260065009
There is also a story that it is less troublesome than a bigger guy because it is small and quick.\nWell ... to experience that the difference in physique is not reflected in the strength as it is ....

ID=260065010
... Oops, sorry.\nElders have long stories. Ha ha ha.

ID=260065011
Then tell you what to do.

ID=260065012
The annihilation of the codename "Red Food".\n... That's it.

ID=260065013
Have you tried it too easy? Ha ha ha.

ID=260065014
It might be a simple task for you, but the others are not.\nIn other words, it seems that you are terrible.

ID=260065015
Well, it is about time to depart.

ID=660065001
Even though it is a simple task, I'm prohibited.\nTighten your mind and let it come in.

ID=360065001
Hmm? What happened?\nIs there also a question?

ID=360065002
The mission is to annihilate the code name "Red Food".\nDo not despair the enemy.

ID=560065001
It was so early. We have received reports.

ID=560065002
This would make it easier for members to fight.\nIt was a hard time.

ID=460065001
Would you do another job at the same time?

ID=260065501
Maksim - san. You really do not do it?

ID=260065502
I do not know Eagle! Come on!\nI've come so far without inconvenience! What is it ... now!

ID=260065503
Well, you do not have any problems?\nWell then, who was the one who was dying after being held in a tank yesterday?

ID=260065504
That 's right, that's just a happening!\nEh! I already do not know Eagle! Do not do it if you say Kuran! ! !

ID=260065505
Let's do it without being shitless!\nYou know my personality.\nWhat will happen if it remains like this ....

ID=260065506
...! !

ID=260065507
You see, kindly saying, is not it?\nWell then, I will talk in a direction to do ....

ID=260065508
Wait, wait! Still prepared for the mind ...!\nThat 's right ... Let' s listen to the opinions of third parties!

ID=260065509
Hey! You there! Eagle, are you overweight? Hey?\nStill OK? There must be no diet in this year! What?

ID=260065510
Contact That silence means to agree!\nSo, Eagle is in the workplace ...!

ID=260065511
Also such a quibble ... Ah, this! Maxim's!

ID=260065512
(A fat man leaves as if to run away)

ID=260065513
Totally ... It is a good year to be a child.\nWhat do you do if there is something?

ID=260065514
Well, you too do something extra ...?\n... Maybe rumor "newcomer"?

ID=260065515
Nice to meet you. I'm a runner of Heavy Gears.\nNo way I can meet famous people in such a place ~.

ID=260065516
Huh? A little earlier?\nAh-ha. It's not a big deal.

ID=260065517
You have an old man who ran away earlier, do not you?\nThat man was getting serious with the recent fattening.

ID=260065518
Oh, by the way that uncle also belongs to Heavy Gears.\nWhen we maintain tanks, we often dive down to inspect the bottom.

ID=260065519
So you get pinched and you can not get out.\nSure enough, I got caught safely yesterday.

ID=260065520
It's even an hour! Oh, I will snag even just remember.\nIt was a serious thing if I did not pass nearby.

ID=260065521
There was such a thing, I recommended diet from yesterday.\nThen that Zama. That speed is that fast ... really disgusting.

ID=260065522
Hehe. But that's why it's burning.\nEven though I belong to the same troops any more, I can not escape.

ID=260065523
I will pursue more and forcibly diet. Hehe.

ID=260065524
Yoshi ... If you decide so, you have the preparation.\nYou ... can you help me for a moment?

ID=260065525
Let's secure a place first.\nIf you run, the wide place without obstacles is the best. Well ....

ID=260065526
Ah! highway!\nThere are many things, but the size is enough. Alright, decided!

ID=260065527
Will not you clear away the highway for a moment?\nYou only need things of the size you can clean up.

ID=660065501
Giggle Thank you. Well this time I will ask you a favor,\nI'll give you something about a little while ago.

ID=660065502
Well then, thanks.

ID=360065501
It seems to be able to secure space if it is a highway. Can you clean up that place?\nThanks ~.

ID=560065501
How? I think I will run.

ID=560065502
Hehe, Thanks!\nJust chase after!

ID=560065503
You do work better?\nGiggle I'm sure I will have a long relationship.

ID=560065504
Well, it was saved this time anyway.\nNice to meet you next time!

ID=560065505
Oh, just to be sure I will tell you ....\nIs it a secret to my uncle? Good?

ID=460065501
Hehe. See you.

ID=260066001
I met you again! %username%!

ID=260066002
Following Loco Town, to Grace City ....

ID=260066003
Is not it going to move all the way together this way? Ha ha ha!

ID=260066004
... It's a joke!

ID=260066005
Ah, Yomi's guy is also coming to Grace City.\nDamage in Kandusity is deca, so I came to this place.

ID=260066006
Well, maybe it's because I came along with%username%! Ha ha ha!

ID=260066007
Now it's time to stand up, but if you can afford it please go once. Ha ha ha!

ID=260066008
Oh, and there is something I'd like to ask you a little, but is your time okay?

ID=660066001
I am always grateful for your help! Ha ha ha!

ID=660066002
No, I heard from a little Starry Forest Allied Units,\nThere is a guy who hangs his arm from the shoulder extra in Vesi ...!

ID=660066003
I also thought that I recently want more hands! Ha ha ha!

ID=660066004
... JOKES! joke!

ID=660066005
Anyway, my request is that I want them to bring their arms!\nEverything looks like an arm made by a machine, but ... I do not care about the mechanism!

ID=660066006
I heard that they are talking that they appear on the expressway side.\nCan not you go there?

ID=360066001
Well, the skill of a man who seems to be stronger than a normal guy is a good squirrel.\nBecause a strong guy generally has a good thing! Ha ha ha!

ID=560066001
This is the wrist hanging from the shoulder of that Vege.

ID=460066001
Hmm ... It will not be understood just by looking!

ID=460066002
Ss need to research a little more!

ID=460066003
Um ... by the way ... this one that does not move by itself? My mother ....

ID=260066501
%username%! welcome!

ID=260066502
I asked the merchant association to investigate the machine arm that I brought before.\nIt's more complicated than I thought ... Anyway, it looks like I'm supposed to be troublesome a lot.

ID=260066503
It is a situation that I can not say unless I examine other machine arms ....

ID=260066504
... That means that sort of thing! Ha ha ha!

ID=260066505
That way,%username%! I want to have another hard work!

ID=260066506
Even if you ask ... Is that a good thing?

ID=260066507
Will you listen to the story?\nThe code name "Jin Fistall" is the one that has a wrist similar to Black Gauntlet.

ID=260066508
In a story you heard, that is the way it is on the highway.\nHow could you do ... Is it possible?

ID=660066501
Thank you! Anytime it's a good thing!

ID=360066501
If it is Jinfistor it will be on the highway.\nWould you go there and get me the machine arm!

ID=560066501
How was?

ID=560066502
thank you very much! Take it to the laboratory immediately!

ID=560066503
But the Rapid Flame guys, how are you doing this ...?\nIt seemed sparse to the machine, though.

ID=460066501
Well, I guess the world is wide!\nHa ha ha! see you!

ID=260067001
Hey, you! ! !

ID=260067002
What "celebrities" came from Kandusity is ... you?

ID=260067003
Well, I was saved last time.\nI want to take a diet like this in this year.

ID=260067004
There it is, can you just ask me a favor?

ID=260067005
Oops ... I was late for introducing myself!\nEagle is Maxim.\nHeavy Gears maintenance director.

ID=260067006
Hmm? It is amazing how good the maintenance manager is?\nDoes your arms look good?

ID=260067007
Gahaha! It seems there are eyes to see people!\nI do not know but eagle is a long time ago.

ID=260067008
Oh, what do you ask?\nGahaha! I'm so sorry! Recently I'm careless ....

ID=260067009
I get it. That's so angry.\nIt is impatient to be young these days.

ID=260067010
In the Rapid Flame that appeared on the highway\nArmor ... There was a guy like a giant rock of stone called Nanchan?

ID=260067011
That stone guy has destroyed all the tanks that Eagle has maintained!\nIt is already messed up. That way you can not even repair it.

ID=260067012
Well that's nice. Eagle would have been about to destroy all the enemy's tanks.\nIs not that young, is not it?

ID=260067013
However, the problem is not there!\nThat guy, you did not give me an eye for the tanks that other guys had maintained ....

ID=260067014
For some reason, only the tanks that Eagle has maintained are destroyed ...!\nCould it be? Why only eagle ...! !

ID=260067015
In the first place, why do you understand that it is an eagle?\nYou did not write the name on the tank!

ID=260067016
Do you have the ability to understand owners of weapons?\nOr maybe I'm getting something to Eagle ...?

ID=260067017
I'm having trouble sleeping lately recently because of such troubles. Oh, I see. I'm getting fat with that!\nWhat is it all swelling? Yes, this is not meat!

ID=260067018
... It is true?

ID=260067019
......

ID=260067020
OK .... I will cancel the meat.

ID=260067021
Well anyway! The reason is a mystery,\nThat you managed to do that stone guy!

ID=260067022
What should I do? That's right.\n"Do not break down all the great Maxim's tanks! (Bakorn!)" ....

ID=260067023
It's a joke, joke. Just recently young people are imagination.\nWell, let's just let the same eyes! What?

ID=260067024
Like an eagle 's chariot, he' s getting shattered too!\nI will turn back if I do it! That is a man! What?

ID=660067001
I asked for it!\nLet's regret that hands on the Eagle's Tank!

ID=360067001
Even though Armor on the highway, come down the right hammer of justice!\nI asked for it!

ID=560067001
You did it! What?\nHou ... How did you do it?

ID=560067002
Gahaha! Ah, I see I see!\nWell, my job is quick and I can save you!

ID=560067003
With this you can sleep well without being bothered by him.\nAll thanks to you!

ID=560067004
Well then, will you go for the remaining tanks?

ID=560067005
Oops! So you ....\nWhat was your name ...?

ID=560067006
%username% or ... It does not suit name! Gahaha!

ID=460067001
See you again!

ID=260067501
Oh, wait a second!

ID=260067502
There was something I needed right now!\nCan I have you asked me once more?

ID=260067503
Thanks to you, I was given a hammer of justice.\nThere is no guarantee that the same thing will not happen, do you?

ID=260067504
In this era, it is more important to prevent in advance than coping from the incident occurrence!\nGahaha! Eagle said good things now! Once in a while ....

ID=260067505
Oh it is okay. Where the story went derailed.\nCome on, do not look at such a face.

ID=260067506
So why do not you tell me the matter.\nI want the armor before this to bring his armor pieces.

ID=260067507
I do not want long stories, but please listen well.\nWith the chariot of Washira and that fellow, he is a bit hard.

ID=260067508
That's it. In order not to destroy the tank,\nIt is necessary to make things of hardness not to be defeated by them.

ID=260067509
Do you agree?\nThat's why we need armor pieces of that armor.

ID=260067510
You understand the story, do not you? Then, I asked a little!\nNext time I will make something that can get him back!

ID=660067501
nice to meet you!

ID=360067501
Bring armor pieces of armor-chan.\nI will turn back on the Eagle's tank next time! I'm begging you!

ID=560067501
Did you get armor pieces?

ID=560067502
Hou ... Is this armor piece?\nIt seems that it is not much different from the material of the washas ... after seeing the details in detail.

ID=560067503
Anyway, I was saved.\nYou may be proud. I helped to evolve the Eagle's tank!

ID=460067501
Well, be careful and return! Gahahaha!

ID=260068001
Oh, came and came!\nI am busy now, can you wait there?

ID=260068002
(The run seems to be looking for something)

ID=260068003
That ... no way.\nA little masu no matter.

ID=260068004
Hmm? What's wrong?\nThe thing which was put in the spare is gone ....

ID=260068005
Oh, that's right! I hope you help me.

ID=260068006
Huh? Why did you call you? Ahaha.\nI recently came in and out of Mr. Maxim's society so often, I wonder what happened.

ID=260068007
I have a case of diet before this, so I should try to explore.\nBut it looks okay.

ID=260068008
... the story will change, but there is something I want you to help me.

ID=260068009
By content? Ahaha.\nYou were a straightforward impression, but it is surprising.

ID=260068010
Er ... Before this, there was a hurry and I borrowed fuel from the tank of Maxim.\nI thought I'd let it fill up later.

ID=260068011
The spare fuel has gone so long ago.\nHowever, it seems that the tank that borrowed fuel is used for this operation!

ID=260068012
So, I have to fill it up.\nThere is no surplus fuel ... So, you need your strength!

ID=260068013
What if we did not help?\nWell ... I will write an accountmaker with disturbance of strategy.\nAnd the trust from Mr. Maxim and others has fallen to the ground and from here ....

ID=260068014
Huh? Can you help me?\nWow, do it!

ID=260068015
It's easy to get it done.\nGo down the highway and you'll have a petrol station that got ruined along the way.

ID=260068016
Since there was no one using it since Rapid Flame occupied,\nThere should be some fuel left in the lubricator. Just put it in the gas tank! Easy, right?

ID=660068001
Thank you very much.\nWell then, do your best!

ID=360068001
Go down the highway and you'll have a petrol station that got ruined along the way.\nFill the fuel from the lubricator there and bring it! Well then, thanks.

ID=560068001
Wow! Thanks!\nIs this fuel?

ID=560068002
I was saved.\nI was about to lose my trust ....

ID=560068003
All thanks to you. ... Do you know?\nAhaha. You are a funny guy after all.

ID=560068004
run! run! !

ID=560068005
... Yaba, I did it! What?

ID=560068006
run ...! Huh! ...! Ran, you!

ID=560068007
(Run hid behind a gas tank)

ID=560068008
Well, what happened? Maxim's.\nDid you become interested in dieting?

ID=560068009
That's not it!\nYou have not heard the news?

ID=560068010
Notify what is it?

ID=560068011
No, no, nothing!\nI do not know if it is good. Well, this is the eagle ....

ID=560068012
Wait a minute, I said that ....\nNo way ... did something happen to the starting team?

ID=460068001
No, that's why ... Gohon.\nAnd, anyway!

ID=460068002
Please wait! (Gashi)\nWhat ... What happened?

ID=260068501
Definitely calm down! What?\nI can say well that you are such a thing ....

ID=260068502
Also Please say clearly!\nWhat is it? Did something happen to the front corps?

ID=260068503
There is a codename "Hell In Forcer" in the place where the original team headed.\nAn emergency increase request has come ....

ID=260068504
... what.

ID=260068505
... La, run?

ID=260068506
Then, with backward support with Saschi, that Her Heralit\nYou just have to defeat him.

ID=260068507
run. Why is not that simple story?\nThat power is an executive class? Hey, are you listening?

ID=260068508
Mr. Maxim ... Mr. Maxim ... I was not afraid, did I?\nDo you say that you have to wait and hold your fingers until the first team is destroyed?

ID=260068509
That's not it. But once you get permission at the top ...!

ID=260068510
Maxim, you know my personality, do not you?\nIf you do, you're going to destroy it, turn it over. That is me.

ID=260068511
Also, if an increase request comes, it is judged to be "emergency situation".\nA unit that has received "emergency sortie permission" in advance can depart as long as it reports even without permission. right?

ID=260068512
No, it seems that ...! I'm still ready.

ID=260068513
You are always doing preparations!\nPlease do so again! I will go first! Okay!

ID=260068514
(The run sailed or headed toward the tank)

ID=260068515
La, run! Wait! Kora! Hey, run!\nHuh ... Masu.

ID=260068516
That's it! you! Give me a hand.\nWell then, when will you get into a helpless!

ID=260068517
You just respond to the increase? No, not.\nThe guy in the run is a moment water heater.

ID=260068518
Once it gets fucked, whatever you are going to get stuck in to protect people.\nI am encouraged as a friend, but I am worried because I am a friend.

ID=260068519
Because I do not like being guarded because it is a woman, I feel that I am purposely doing ah.\nThat character of the run is not going to get back later ... is not it ....

ID=260068520
Oops! I did not have time to talk long time ...!\nIt is because of you! It is a strange and heard guy, so I guess!

ID=260068521
To stop the runaway run anyway,\nYou only have to clear up the cause first!

ID=260068522
How do I make believe that I cleaned up?\nIt is easy. Show me something like that symbol.\nIt is a so-called loot.

ID=260068523
If you say that helper is a guy ....\n"Huge hammer"! This is it!

ID=660068501
It is not possible to have two responses. Gahaha!\nWith this, the run and the starting team are likely to come home safely.

ID=660068502
Okay, I asked for it?\nPlease be careful!

ID=360068501
what? I am busy right now.\nIf there is something to do later.

ID=560068501
(Pass Hell Inforcers' huge hammer to the run)

ID=560068502
Hmm? What's this. hammer?

ID=560068503
Oh, no ... ... Helloinforcer or anyone's hammer?\nAhaha. Have you gone past.

ID=560068504
(The run smiled while looking at the hammer, and returned wirelessly somewhere)

ID=560068505
The starting team also returned safely. Fuu ....

ID=560068509
Mr. Maxim right?\nStop stopping me with blood coming up.

ID=560068507
I have a hard time at all. Ahaha.\nWell, the result is OK.

ID=560068508
Thank you for saving me a few days ago.\nI will give thanks to Mr. Maxim.

ID=460068501
I will tell Mr. Maxim from me. What you came back to.\nWell then, see you ~.

ID=260069001
(One big golden retriever, one looking at it with a dark expression)

ID=260069002
one!

ID=260069003
(The Golden Retriever has a collar written as "Good Boy")

ID=260069004
(Although there seems to be an owner, why are they so alone?

ID=660069001
(People who are familiar with urban circumstances seem to need to hear stories)

ID=360069001
(Nothing has been examined yet)

ID=600690101
Is it for something?

ID=600690102
(I heard about Thor Goodbody)

ID=600690103
Hmm, Goodboy ... do you want to know why the dog is alone?

ID=600690104
I do not know in detail ... There was a time when a lot of pets overflowed into the city after the blank occurred.\nIt is a pet that lost its owner, and a pet forgotten by the owner.

ID=600690105
Is not that a good boy included in such a pet, too?

ID=600690106
Hmm ... This story seems to be more familiar than me.\nFor example, children near Goodboy.

ID=600690107
I have not defeated, but I guess the dog likes the young man.

ID=600690108
Why do not you visit?

ID=600690201
Hmm? What's wrong?

ID=600690202
I have a name called Ted.\nFrom now on you can call it by name properly!

ID=600690203
So what?\nIs anyone looking for me?

ID=600690204
(I asked Ted about Goodbody)

ID=600690205
Good boy? Oh, I often play together.\nRide on the back and play the ball!

ID=600690206
But recently I do not eat rice properly.\nI do not feel well.

ID=600690207
I will not eat the rice which we brought.\nI wonder if it is bad or bad?

ID=600690208
Huh? Perhaps the owner has gone?\nWell, I guess so.

ID=600690209
But, before, the uncle used to give rice to a good boy.\nI have not seen it lately.

ID=600690210
It seems I liked playing with that uncle as a baseball.\nOnce the ball came to me, I've hit back with a bat!

ID=600690211
Hehe. But, as the ball dropped onto the truck and went to the highway as it was\nIt's gone.

ID=600690212
That old man, looks great and chasing me. I ran around.\nTo Hehe. That time was fun!

ID=600690213
Oh, I got it!\nYou want to play with a good boy, do not you?

ID=600690214
Then, you should find the ball that went to the highway?

ID=560069001
Bow-wow.

ID=560069002
(Goodboy still seems not to be energetic)

ID=560069003
Won?

ID=560069004
(I feel like I miss something)

ID=460069001
(Looking at the situation a bit, it seems better to have looked for the ball that Ted said)

ID=260069501
(Approaching Goodbody to see the situation)

ID=260069502
Woof! Woof!

ID=260069503
(I will bark while watching this, so I will move the place)

ID=260069504
Won? Bow-wow!

ID=260069505
(Goodboy does not see this, as usual I am staring at only one place)

ID=260069506
(Looking at the direction you are looking at, apparently it seems to be on the highway)

ID=660069501
(As Ted said, it seems necessary to look for a ball on the highway)

ID=360069501
(Let's find the ball on the highway, as Ted said)

ID=560069501
(Show the old baseball ball that was caught by steel as a good boy)

ID=560069502
Woof! Woof!

ID=560069503
(Goodboy jumped over the ball)

ID=560069504
Wow! one! one!

ID=560069505
That, Goodboy! You got better?

ID=560069506
Oh, that! That baseball ball!\nDid you find it on the highway?

ID=560069507
Woof! Woof!

ID=560069508
Hahaha! Look! Goodboy is laughing!\nAs expected, that uncle was the owner ~.\nHehe. Oh, but how did you find out! What?

ID=560069509
Why was Kacha - nee said that monsters live on the highway?\nCould it be ... you are a hero! What?

ID=560069510
No, you can not tell me!\nHeroes can not tell anyone their identity! What! What?

ID=560069511
one!

ID=560069512
that's right? Good boy. Come on, what I did ...!\nBut ... what shall I do .... I want to call a hero! But ... everybody gonna get fucked ... / /.

ID=560069513
Bow-wow? Wow, Wow!

ID=560069514
That's it! Let's be a master!\nI also want to be a hero!\nDoing so, thank you! Master! !

ID=560069515
Bow-wow!

ID=560069516
(......)

ID=560069517
Thanks! Good boy! You are a good boy!

ID=560069518
Wowon!

ID=560069519
(It has become a funny thing ...)

ID=560069520
Master! Make me an apprentice!

ID=560069521
Bow-wow!

ID=560069522
(It is Masui who can see such a place by someone! Run away)

ID=460069501
Ah! Master! Please wait ~!

ID=460069502
Wowon! one! Bow-wow!

ID=260070001
Oh! I came.

ID=260070002
I am bad soon, but I have a favor to ask!

ID=260070003
The scar that appeared on the highway before this,\nI think I was doing something like industrial goggles ... would you bring it with me?

ID=260070004
Gahaha ... in fact you lost your goggles!\nI also thought about ordering ....

ID=260070005
It will take a month to reach.

ID=260070006
If the eagle is absent for a month, big loss will come out to the unit!\nIf there is no eagle, the tank is not healed!

ID=260070007
Wow? Is that so?\nIf it is not Maxim, you can not repair the tank.

ID=260070008
Gahaha! Well! Anyway, Eagle is the maintenance director!\nAll the tanks are direct ... ...? You ... did you say something?

ID=260070009
Oh, have you forgotten to hear your subordinates' voice?\nChief maintenance officer who can fix tanks alone?

ID=260070010
La, run!\nOk ... ... What are you saying!\nYou must be joking! Gahaha ... Ha ....

ID=260070011
Sentence. Well, let's ask other people, too? Hey ...!

ID=260070012
What! ! ! ! The eagle was bad! !\nSay it! So do not call everyone ...!

ID=260070013
Hmm, I should say that from the beginning.\nSo? What happened to Scar?

ID=260070014
(Maxim spoke of goggles to the run)

ID=260070015
Huh? Did you lose your goggles?\nSuch an important thing ...! It is the same as soldiers losing guns on the battlefield!

ID=260070016
No ... That's it.

ID=260070017
I mean, there are working goggles paid to the team!\nWhy are not you using it though why everyone uses it? What?

ID=260070018
Well, that's because it suits you!\nAnd anyway! Bring Scar's goggles!

ID=260070019
A little! What are you saying! What?\nMaxim's!

ID=660070001
(Maxim escaped from the run and quickly whispered)

ID=660070002
Hurry up! If you come in as soon as possible, you will not have to ask the runners' sayings! !

ID=360070001
You still have it!

ID=360070002
You ... are you enjoying the current situation of eagle! What?\nask! ! Please bring it as soon as possible!

ID=360070003
You asked me ...!

ID=560070001
Brought it!

ID=560070002
Oh, this is it!

ID=560070003
I'll wear it! I will be too cool for a while!\nWith this, you do not have to listen to yourself for a while!

ID=560070004
Oh, is that so?

ID=560070005
The runner, even though there was something of humor in old days, it was cute.\nBecause I am years old, it is getting more and more enraged.

ID=560070006
Well, then?

ID=560070007
So? You say that ... that is, I will correct my personality before I recover the tank.\nHey, this voice is not ...! What?

ID=560070008
Pingpong! Is me.\nApparently does not seem to like this character?

ID=560070009
Surely, that is ....

ID=560070010
Well, is that Scar's goggles?

ID=560070011
Looking at the place where goggles are applied only to one eye, you mean that the other one is not necessary, right?\nIs not it? Mr. Ku Si · Mr.?

ID=560070012
If one side ... ... you silly!\nWell, there is such a thing!

ID=560070013
What are you talking about?\nEven one eye is enough if it is a competent maintenance director!

ID=460070001
Or, do not stop! run!\nHuaAua! Please, please help!

ID=460070002
It is bad public hearing that he helped me. Huff.\nMaxim, do not move.

ID=460070003
(The eyes of the orchids are settled, let's escape before getting caught)

ID=260070501
(A shoulder collided with someone)

ID=260070502
Oh, I'm sorry. You are thinking ....

ID=260070503
(I also apologized)

ID=260070504
Um, perhaps ... I recently came from Kandus city ...?

ID=260070505
Nice to meet you. I was planning to say hello once ....\nNo way to meet in this way ....

ID=260070506
No, it's not a big deal.\nBecause I wanted to ask you a little.

ID=260070507
Oh, I did not introduce myself yet.\nI am Katy. I am working at a nearby nursing home.

ID=260070508
You are%username%, are not you?\nHuh. I'm honoured to be able to meet you.

ID=260070509
Even when you have time, please come and visit the facility.\nEveryone is surely ....

ID=260070510
Ah! !

ID=260070511
Katya Onee, look at it! There are children inside.

ID=260070512
(Children are making noise in front of Ned Company's building)

ID=260070513
Hey, you can not play around there?\nYou said a teacher, are not you? In this building?

ID=260070514
Do not get close!

ID=260070515
Yes, I did a good job. Huh.\nWell, are you going home? There may be favorite sweets ~ ~?

ID=260070516
Oooh!

ID=260070517
(The momentum the children went back to the nearby nursing home)

ID=260070518
Fuu, I was glad that there was nothing.\nI ... I do not want to do anything when it is said to be bad after all. Something else ....

ID=260070519
Huh? What is he suffering ...?\nAhaha. I'm sorry ... I ... again.

ID=260070520
Recently, you know that Vesi has appeared in the building of Ned Company?\nIt seems that there is a Vesi in the form of a child.

ID=260070521
Some children said that "There was a child in the building of the Ned Company."\nThen, everyone started to go play over there.

ID=260070522
I want to prevent children from entering the building,\nEven if you say that there is a monster, you are thinking only about threatening complaints ....

ID=260070523
It is a good thing to play with children, whether for people or Vesi,\nThat Vesi ... I have things that are idle.

ID=260070524
If by any chance injury ....\n... How can I stop going?

ID=260070525
Well ....

ID=260070526
Well ....

ID=260070527
Ha ha! Excuse me! I'll tell you ....\nAh! %username% is a member of the Star Forest Alliance, right?

ID=260070528
Then, can you enter that building?

ID=260070529
really? Then ... please go inside the building.

ID=260070530
And, "Will you play a little deeper so that you can not see from the outside?"\nWill you say "Please come and say"?

ID=260070531
... Well, have you been asked? A face like a soul suddenly escaped.\nSomething like that ...? If you do not mind, please take a day off at our facility.

ID=260070532
Oh, do not have a bad idea for those with bad physical condition .... I only have to do with myself.\nExcuse me ... Please forget about the previous things ....

ID=260070533
Huh? Does it do?\nNo, I do not feel well ...

ID=660070501
really? Thank you very much.\nIf you get sick when you come in, please come back soon.

ID=660070502
Okay, thank you.

ID=660070503
Well, I appreciate it! I was in trouble.

Do not push yourself too much.

ID=360070501
Oh, is the content confirmed?

ID=360070502
"Can you play with a little more depth so that you can not see it from the outside?"\nis. Huff.

ID=360070503
(Since I do not seem to hear absolutely, try not to come out from the back)

ID=360070504
be careful.

ID=560070501
Oh, have they returned already?

ID=560070502
how was it? Did you listen properly ...?

ID=560070503
Well, is that so?\nGood children are good.

ID=560070504
I would like to let them play together unless I have even noisy items ....

ID=560070505
Though I was sick, I really appreciate it.

ID=560070506
(......)

ID=460070501
I'm going to thank you next time.\nWell, have a nice day.

ID=260071001
Hello!\nPerhaps it is a person who is new to the coalition?

ID=260071002
Oh, nice to meet you. I'm called Allen.\nExcuse me ... may I ask your name?

ID=260071003
It is%username%, is not it?\nThank you!

ID=260071004
But ... you are much younger than you see in the pictures. Ha ha ha.\nTo be on the battlefield at that age ... honestly surprised!

ID=260071005
Huh? Where did you see the picture?\nUm, butler ... oh no, I got to know you acquainted! Ha ha ha ....

ID=260071006
Allen-in-elder brother!\nHmm? Ah ~ mentor! !

ID=260071007
Oh! Ted! It's nice timing! !\nHa ha ha.

ID=260071008
Huh? What are you telling me, Onii-chan?\nWhat is Ted! What? Feeling good.

ID=260071009
It is rude of you to feel bad.\nWell, I've put on you ... but, originally, what is politeness ....

ID=260071010
Yes I understand, I understood.

ID=260071011
Yes, you can.\nSo, is there something for me?

ID=260071012
Oh, that's right! It is hard work!\nThis is a gift that my older brother!\nIt broke before I showed it to Kacha - neechan.

ID=260071013
Well! What? Already! What?\nEven though the craftsmen made with the finest plastic ...!

ID=260071014
Onii-chan ... You're looking at us all sweet?\nHave you ever seen a brittle toy lasting longer?

ID=260071015
......

ID=260071016
What?

ID=260071017
Dammit ... surely. Well, this is unexpected. I thought Ike will this time.\nWhat should I do ....

ID=260071018
It can not be helped. Should I buy it again? What?

ID=260071019
Onii-chan, that's it.\nA bullshit story ... the one who stopped doing it already ....

ID=260071020
Ted ~! Where have you been going without cleaning?! What?\nI will not give a snack if I do not come back!

ID=260071021
Squid Haha, I'm going now!\nAnyway, Onii-chan! Alright, stop it! I understood! What?

ID=260071022
Sister! If I am here! That's why ~ ~! ! !

ID=260071023
(Ted gone in a hurry)

ID=260071024
......

ID=260071025
Um ...%username%.\nWhat did Ted say?

ID=260071026
It seems I was not the only ones I could not catch.\nWhat should I do not do ... Well, it looks like a riddle.

ID=260071027
Huh? Why are you so worried?\nNo ... well, to be honest ... ... I do not care about Mr. Kacha ....

ID=260071028
I can not say the reason, but I do not misunderstand ... I never decided by appearance alone!

ID=260071029
Katja is like that, but children also like toys so occasionally gifts.\nChildren of that age are too energetic and will break soon.

ID=260071030
I thought it was fine this time ....\nWell ... whatever you choose, even if you buy a new one ....

ID=260071031
Well ... ah!

ID=260071032
Perhaps I do not like the gift I got so far, a message saying that I should buy another one ...! What?\nWell, the storm has come in line.

ID=260071033
That means that we need to know their needs ...!\nNo, it seems that there was not enough care for them.

ID=260071034
Then, how can we respond to that need?\nEven as I go to listen directly.

ID=260071035
That's it! There was a prominent spirit "Jury" of a nursing home!\nThat girl surely will give you an accurate answer.

ID=260071036
%username%! To listen directly to me is also called poverty.\nWill you ask me instead?

ID=660071001
Thank you!\nYou are kind regardless of rumors. %username%.

ID=660071002
Well, I'm waiting here.

ID=360071001
Please ask the children what information they want from Julie.\nI do not care about me!

ID=600710101
What is it? Urumu around the person from a little while ago.

ID=600710102
If there is a talk, can you do it first?\nIt is totally rude.

ID=600710103
%username% ...?\nOh, you are his master?

ID=600710104
Ko, Kohon. Well, I also introduce myself.\nI am Julie. I am indebted to this nursing home now.

ID=600710105
But if my father comes, I will go to another place again. This is about a greeting.

ID=600710106
So what is the matter?

ID=600710107
(I asked what the kids wanted)

ID=600710108
What do you want ...? Is that all, you asked Mr. Allen?\nI see ... is that something like that? Huh.

ID=600710109
A good thing came up ....\nunderstood. I will tell you.

ID=600710110
It is "an adult-like female doll held by Vesi".\nPlease tell him.

ID=600710111
What did you come up with? That's secret. Huh.\nPlease tell it properly.

ID=600710112
see you.

ID=560071001
I was waiting!\nWhat is the Julie?

ID=560071002
An adult-like female doll held by Vesi! What?\nWell, it is really pinpoint.\nDoes Julie like that?

ID=560071003
Well, now it seems to be only to prepare it.\nBut ... getting a bit of a challenge to get it.

ID=560071004
Oh, thank you for asking instead!

ID=460071001
Well, I will ... with this.

ID=260071501
Um ...%username% san ....

ID=260071502
What is the "matured female doll held by Vesi" I taught before ....

ID=260071503
Apparently, it seems that Vesi "Python" in the building of the Ned Company has it.\nMy personal mercenary ... Oh, no, I asked someone I knew ....

ID=260071504
It seems that we can not enter without the permission of the Star Forest Alliance.\nMoreover, it is said that the purpose is too personal and it is difficult to obtain permission ....

ID=260071505
With my present strength, I do not have the ability to break through this situation.\nI am at a loss for doing that ....

ID=260071506
Suddenly, the face of%username% came floating!\nSo call me ....

ID=260071507
If you put it in that building ...%username% ....\nWill you come and pick up the doll?

ID=260071508
We will prepare as much as you want!\nIt is my first time to say what I want from children.

ID=260071509
......

ID=260071510
Actually ... All the children in that facility have lost their families.

ID=260071511
So ... I'd like to grant those wishes even a little!\nI do not think that he will heal the wounds of those children by such a thing.

ID=260071512
Still, I'd like to see a figure that rejoices.

ID=260071513
Of course, I also wanted to see Mr. Kacha's pleasure.

ID=660071501
Good, is not it! What? What is a good reward?\nBecause I will prepare it!

ID=660071502
Huh ...? Unnecessary?\nWhat a thing ... this is a hero ...! !

ID=660071503
But then, I do not care!\nAlthough it is trivial, I will prepare something.

ID=360071501
According to the information, Vesi "Python" in the building of Ned Company,\nHe seems to have a doll called Julie.

ID=360071502
Please bring it.

ID=560071501
I was waiting! how was it?

ID=560071502
(I gave the doll to Allen)

ID=560071503
Uninvited, wiped!

ID=560071504
Nana, what is this? What?\nReally Vesi like this doll ...! What?

ID=560071505
Is that so? I do not see you as a lie ....\nWere you wanting this ... those children ....

ID=560071506
Although I feel a bit funny ... If you wanted it originally,\nIt is natural that you do not like the present you got.

ID=560071507
Ha, ha ha ha. I do not have a child recently.

ID=460071501
So, this ... what should I do?

ID=260072001
... Ah, that ... well, if you! Please do not threaten me!\nI suddenly got surprised because the reaction ceased.

ID=260072002
Oh, that's right ....\nThe problem is how to pass this present.

ID=260072003
But, this doll ... stimulation is too strong ...!\nHuh ...... I can not see it directly! Negative!

ID=260072004
Huh? Is%username% giving you?\nI'm really sorry! To tell the truth, I am also having trouble holding it ....

ID=260072005
Well, thank you!\nOh, not to distribute gifts to each person ....

ID=260072006
Please pass it to Ted.\nIf you do that, it will be distributed to everyone.

ID=660072001
Well, I appreciate it! I was in trouble.

ID=660072002
I hope everyone will be glad.

ID=360072001
Please give gifts to Ted.\nThen Ted will give it to everyone.

ID=360072002
I hope everyone will be glad.

ID=600720101
Oh, my master! What's wrong?\nDid you come to see me?

ID=600720102
(I gave Ted a present from Allen)

ID=600720103
What's this?\nAllen brother ...?

ID=600720104
Completely ... I do not want to stop presents any more.\n... So, now what ... god!

ID=600720105
Well! What? What is this! What? Because I wanted this! What?\nNo! Where is the child who wants such a thing!

ID=600720106
Master, who are you asking it from?\nPerhaps ... a girl who has a doll?

ID=600720107
Of course! That bad boy!\nI will not forgive this time!

ID=600720108
(Ted ran angrily towards Julie and let's go over)

ID=600720201
Suddenly what!\nNot rude!

ID=600720202
shut up! Which is rude?\nYou! I told you guys want this funny doll!

ID=600720203
Where is rude of me! Besides, I do not know such a thing!\nYou do not have any evidence, will you stop stopping funny words?

ID=600720204
It is not a blur! There is such a pranky lady!\nAnyway, let's have a strange gift for Allen's brother, so that Kacha's older sister did not like it!

ID=600720205
I? Haha, you can laugh when you get to this point!\nI will not talk with you. Levels are too different!

ID=600720206
Oh? What are they doing?

ID=600720207
... Chit.

ID=600720208
Kacha - in - elder sister.

ID=600720209
fight?\nCan you tell me what happened?

ID=600720210
It is usual.\nWe are fighting all the time, do not they?

ID=600720211
Is there a reason for that?

ID=600720212
Ted is lying. Hmm.\nIt's because of Ted's possessions.

ID=600720213
What Ted has?\nTed, can you show it?

ID=600720214
No, this is different ...!

ID=600720215
Ted. Even if you have something, the teacher will not dislike it.\nBut it is sad to see Ted, who is lying and hiding secretly.

ID=600720216
I know .... Here ... this ....

ID=600720217
(Ted handed the doll to Kuracha)

ID=600720218
Thank you, Ted.

ID=600720219
Hmm, if you know what it is\nI'm sure you dislike it.

ID=600720220
Well ... this is ....

ID=600720221
you see?

ID=600720222
That's why ...!

ID=600720223
This doll ... It looks very cold.\nI have to dress quickly. Huh.

ID=600720224
Huh ...! What?

ID=600720225
Huh?

ID=600720226
What's wrong? Face with Kyoton.\nYou look cold, huh? What?

ID=600720227
Oh, sorry. I return.

ID=600720228
Oh, Julie? Because it is rice soon.\nYou come home soon ~?

ID=600720229
Hmm!

ID=600720230
(Julie was gone by while being defeated)

ID=600720231
Hey, Sister ... That, do not you think anything?

ID=600720232
why? It looks like it looks cold ... Is there anything else?

ID=600720233
No ... That's not it ....

ID=600720234
Huh, it's okay.\nTeacher, I know what Ted is concerned about.

ID=600720235
This is a present from Mr. Allen, is not it?

ID=600720236
of….\nBut Allen elder brother is not bad!

ID=600720237
Yes, I know.

ID=600720238
However, although I'm going to say I do not give a gift anymore,\nCan you understand that?

ID=600720239
Yes, that's OK.

ID=600720240
Thank you. Well then, come back.\nBecause the teacher will talk with Allen.

ID=600720241
I understood!

ID=600720242
(Ted returned home earlier)

ID=600720243
Let's go to Allen's place.

ID=560072001
%username%! Welcome back ... Nah!\nKa, Mr. Kuracha!

ID=560072002
Hello. Allen.

ID=560072003
Hello! Mr. Kuracha!\nHowever, how is it ... ... Oh, it is different from tea!

ID=560072004
Allen-san, as usual, is not it. Huff.\nToday I have stories about children.

ID=560072005
Ahaha. Well that's too much ... Eh? About children.

ID=560072006
Yes. That ... that's a gift.

ID=560072007
(Katy handed the doll to Allen)

ID=560072008
Here, this ... that ...!\nTo respond to the needs of children ... to respond ....

ID=560072009
I know.\nAllen is thinking carefully about children.

ID=560072010
This doll ... I told Julie, did not he?

ID=560072011
Huh? Oh, yes ....

ID=560072012
As expected after all .... Huh. A jiffy child is not good.\nAllen's feelings were fully transmitted.

ID=560072013
Thank you for always looking after the children.

ID=560072014
That's right! I ... Because I like it!

ID=560072015
But ... I do not want to give presents to children anymore.

ID=560072016
Well ... why ...?\nDid you mean ... was annoying! What?

ID=560072017
Allen ... It is a wonderful way to convey love with things.\nHowever, it is easy to forget that feelings are felt in mind when you do it only.

ID=560072018
Someday I will be asking for things from my heart.\nAnd I think that it will become commonplace before unnoticed.

ID=560072019
You may forget the obvious thing of returning received love with your heart ....

ID=560072020
I do not want children to do so.\nI want children to grow up in love from Allen in return with a heart.

ID=560072021
Mr. Kuracha ....

ID=560072022
How about?\nFrom now on, I'm happy if I can refrain from presents.

ID=560072023
Yes ... I caught my mind.

ID=560072024
Huh. Thank you very much.\nWell, I am with this. Mr. Allen,%username%, take care.

ID=560072025
(Katya went back to the nursing home)

ID=560072026
...%username%.

ID=560072027
It is useless already.

ID=560072028
Mr. Kacha, who will admonish me with such kindness ....\nI became more and more liked!

ID=560072029
Ah! ! ! Kacha of my beloved ... ....

ID=560072030
(......)

ID=460072001
(... let's go back, I do not want to be swayed any further)

ID=260072501
Oh, it's been a long time ago!\nBut sorry. I am in a hurry now.

ID=260072502
Hey, you! Stop the run! Look, quickly!

ID=260072503
(As Mcsim says, I caught a run)

ID=260072504
! !

ID=260072505
(Suddenly the atmosphere of the orang changed, I was thrown out in the right direction)

ID=260072506
Ah! Reflectively ...!\nI'm sorry! All right?

ID=260072507
Why are you catching them in the first place? You can say it.

ID=260072508
If you were not you, you were seriously injured ....\nPlease be careful next time.

ID=260072509
Mom, Maxim.\nDo you know that I throw reflexively?

ID=260072510
Gahaha ... that habit has already been fixed ....\nI hate being touched as ever ....

ID=260072511
People do not change so easily!

ID=260072512
Yes, it's not easy to change.\nThat's why it's okay as it is!\nYou are going to go to Ned's building! What?

ID=260072513
Ping Pong! To Maxim who got the correct answer,\nGive me the reporting right to the top instead of me! Well then ....

ID=260072514
It is useless! ! You are a weapons operation force!\nIt's not a combat unit!

ID=260072515
But I can not keep still!\nCode name "Heavy Steel" is famous for destroying buildings!

ID=260072516
Such a guy is now in that building! What?\nIf you do not hurry you will suffer even the ordinary people and children!

ID=260072517
That's awfully well-known! However, it is not work of Washira.\nRan, you ... Are you planning on a hero too?\nThis is an army. I'm not playing!

ID=260072518
... ...!

ID=260072519
I know ... I know that.\nBut I can not leave it alone!\nExcuse me!

ID=260072520
Geez ....

ID=260072521
Hey, you. Could you please go for a while?

ID=260072522
Maxim's! What?

ID=260072523
This is a personal request.\nWould you please defeat Heavy Steel that it is rampaging in Ned's building?

ID=260072524
ask! You are right.

ID=660072501
Sorry .... I will not forget this kindness!

ID=660072502
Maxim's ....

ID=660072503
I asked for it! Friend!

ID=360072501
......

ID=360072502
Defeat Hebie Steel in the building of Ned.\nI asked, did not I?

ID=560072501
......

ID=560072502
Oh ... Welcome back.

ID=560072503
Oh! What? You returned! Well, I will wear it. Gahahaha.\nIs this a relief?

ID=560072504
......

ID=560072505
What is it? Since the eagle scoffed at the serious mode, was it something like sune?

ID=560072506
Naturally I understood the greatness of Eagle! What? Gahahaha.\nA noisy hawk says to hide his nails, right? Eagle also has deep thoughts and thoughts ....

ID=560072507
Maksim.

ID=560072508
I understand. I understand what you mean.\nYou probably wanted to respect?

ID=560072509
I remembered.

ID=560072510
Oh! What? You already realized the greatness of Eagle! What? Gahahaha!

ID=560072511
Diet, when will you start?

ID=560072512
Gahahaha! Diet or not! Is that so? diet?

ID=560072513
Yes. Maxim who ran away from me for a long time has come to me for myself.\nYou mean Mr. Maxim wanted to diet too, did not he?

ID=560072514
Well, there is such a thing!\nAh! you! Thanks! Okay, eagle is here ...!

ID=560072515
(Maxim escaped without looking back)

ID=560072516
......

ID=560072517
You know.

ID=560072518
run! It's a guest!\nEven if he told me he was Roy! Gahahaha.

ID=560072519
...!

ID=560072520
Well, no! Nothing! Thank you for today!\nIt feels just awful.

ID=460072501
... Thank you.

ID=260073001
Well, it's on time.\nThis is a positive impression.

ID=260073002
Why did you call? I will tell from now.\nIt is surprisingly impatient, is not it? Well good.

ID=260073003
Please appreciate my generosity.

ID=260073004
The reason I called you this time ....\nIt is to have you return in the meantime.

ID=260073005
What is that face? Did you even think that it was volunteering?\nThe world today is reasonable.

ID=260073006
Hmm, I should say that I do it obediently from the beginning.\nSo what do you want me to do ...?

ID=260073007
Please ask Sennia for "How to become an adult".

ID=260073008
What? The face that the pigeons had eaten the bean gun! Impolite!\nDo not ask me! What?

ID=260073009
Well, I want to be an "adult" as soon as possible!\nWhy is there such a low level place ....

ID=260073010
Oh, oh! Please forget about now.\nAnyways! You should do exactly as I say!

ID=260073011
Why is it Senior? Because it is the smartest person in this city.\nWhat's more that power and behavior ... that is only for real adults!

ID=260073012
There! ! I will not laugh! ! !\nPlease listen carefully from Senior!

ID=660073001
Will not you stop laughing? What?

ID=660073002
(It seems that you will be beaten if you make fun of it more.

ID=360073001
Completely! How rude! ! Come quickly!

ID=360073002
(Let's stop making fun of now. Let's go to Sennia to ask "How to be an adult")

ID=600730101
What's wrong?\nBecause I am busy, just tell me the matter.

ID=600730102
(Senior told that Julie wants to know "How to become an adult")

ID=600730103
How to become an adult Julie ...?

ID=600730104
Petit ... Ahahahaha!

ID=600730105
(Senia is bursting laughing)

ID=600730106
Oh my stomach hurts. I wonder if Julie is also adolescents.\nYou could do it even with a boy you care about?

ID=600730107
Julie is also 13 years old, and I also know that boys are interested. Uhufu.\nWell, I guess it's going to be pretty early in puberty ... but I have that girl.

ID=600730108
Adults ... adults. After all the woman is from the chest?

ID=600730109
That is from the heart inside the chest.

ID=600730110
Puppy! What are you going to do with shy?\nI wonder what you are thinking now ~? What? What?

ID=600730111
Well, maybe the size is necessary?\nIt's like a proof of an adult woman.

ID=600730112
But it's tough with the current Julie.\nIf you want to appeal now ... you can only use pads. Huhuhu.

ID=600730113
that? Are you going already? Oh, it's a bit better.\nThe story also caught up!

ID=600730114
(... Let's go home before being made teased more)

ID=560073001
Oh, it was late.

ID=560073002
So ... What is Senia ...?

ID=560073003
(I taught Julia to Senia 's answer)

ID=560073004
Mumumu, chest! What?\nHow disrespectful ...!

ID=560073005
Here, this scuba! You did not listen to Mr. Toll instead of Senia! What?

ID=560073006
Honestly was Senia himself saying ...?\nWell then, to become an adult, breasts ....

ID=560073007
(I explained that it does not mean that kind of thing, apparently it is too late)

ID=560073008
So, what do you need papapa and pads for?\nUooh!

ID=560073009
Such a shameful thing ...! Why, it's all because of you!

ID=560073010
(... as it says something is still going to happen, leave this place soon)

ID=460073001
A little! Where are you going to go! What?\nAre you going to return your incentives with revenge? !

ID=260073501
I thought I would run away,\nYou came back.

ID=260073502
Well, well I was confused at that time,\nI apologize for working rude.

ID=260073503
Oh, oh! I have seen something ....\nA big lady with a whip in that building has ... ....

ID=260073504
Did not you hear it? So that ... that ... Pad, it's a pad! pad! !\nThat's it, please get a "magic pad" from that woman!

ID=260073505
Is not she going to go? This is your job!\nOr is it going to let such a weak girl go to such a dangerous place?

ID=260073506
Just tell them the answer and say "Yes, goodbye" ....\nYou are still a pro! What?

ID=260073507
It is a hundred years early to talk about professional with such consciousness.\nHmm, the name of the hero of Kandusity is just the name ...!

ID=660073501
I need to understand.\nWell, please go there soon!

ID=660073502
(......)

ID=360073501
Huh? Have you forgotten it yet? What?\nEven though I just ordered a while ago ...!

ID=360073502
From a big lady with that building whip,\nI'm taking a "magic pad"!

ID=560073501
Waited for a moment.\nNow, let's do it here at once.

ID=560073502
(I handed "Magical Pad" to Julie)

ID=560073503
I am also in this ... adult!

ID=560073504
(Julie went into a nearby building with a pad)

ID=560073505
What is this! !\nSay something about this is an adult!

ID=560073506
(You can hear the scream of Julie from inside the building)

ID=560073507
Everyone's ... liars are dear! ! !

ID=460073501
(I feel somewhat disgusting ... ... Get off soon)

ID=260074001
Oh, my master!\nGood timing! Will not you go with me?

ID=260074002
Where are you going?

ID=260074003
If you promise not to tell anyone,\nCan I tell you?

ID=260074004
(promised)

ID=260074005
Go to that decky building!\nThen, help the child who is being bullied by the monster!

ID=260074006
Name it, "Ted's great adventure!"

ID=260074007
Let's adventure together! My first adventure goes with my teacher, is not it?\nDo not worry, I have friends too!

ID=260074008
I prepared luggage, and I also put a letter to Kacha's older sister!\nNow, I'm leaving for adventure!

ID=260074009
(......)

ID=260074010
Okay!\nWell then, down to the second group!

ID=660074001
(Ted went to the place of the Goodboy ... I am very anxious ... I will chase it.)

ID=360074001
Master! hurry, hurry! Friends are waiting for us!

ID=360074002
(Anxiety is getting bigger, the second casualty ... surely a good boy)

ID=600740101
Good! Good boy! Oh, that's it!

ID=600740102
one! ... Wow?

ID=600740103
Do you want to know what to play today? To Hehe.\nIt's amazing ~ ~? What?

ID=600740104
Won?

ID=600740105
It's an adventure!\nBe my friend!

ID=600740106
Wow! What?

ID=600740107
(Good boys are upset)

ID=600740108
To Hehe. Is not it fun? From the monster in that decky building,\nGo for the children to help!

ID=600740109
one! Bow-wow! Wowon! What?

ID=600740110
(Goodboy listened to Ted's story and started looking at it and barking)

ID=600740111
(I feel like you know that you are together?)

ID=600740112
one! one! one!

ID=600740113
(I feel like Goodboy tells me to stop this girl)

ID=600740114
Why do you know that there are children?\nKacha - san said that, there was a monster in that building.

ID=600740115
Moreover, from inside, "Bashishi Bashi!"\nI heard the same sound as the witch whip on the animation!

ID=600740116
So surely the monster in that building is a witch with a whip.\nBesides, I saw children wearing hood near the building!

ID=600740117
That must be kids being caught by a witch and being bullied!

ID=600740118
This is the beginning of our magnificent adventure! !

ID=600740119
one! one! Wow ~ ~ ~!

ID=600740120
(Good Boy barked as if denying the story of Ted)

ID=600740121
that? What happened to both the Goodboy and Master.\nOh, I do not believe my story, do you?

ID=600740122
I saw with this eyes clearly! Misunderstanding is not it!

ID=600740123
Woof! Woof!

ID=600740124
Oh I got it.\nI am worried about me, do not you?

ID=600740125
All right! Because the teacher also has encouraging companions!

ID=600740126
(......)

ID=600740127
Wow, one! Gurururutsu! one!

ID=600740128
(Goodboy desperately denies, but I do not seem to be able to communicate)

ID=600740129
(When I looked at the Goodboy with a sorry eye, my eyes met)

ID=600740130
one! Wow, one! Won!

ID=600740131
(I felt that I was going to hold down this kid, you said you are defeating a witch in the meantime!)

ID=600740132
Bow-wow.

ID=600740133
(When you nod, Goodboy makes a decided expression)

ID=600740134
What happened? Good boy.\nDo you want to play here for a while?

ID=600740135
one! Bow-wow!

ID=600740136
I have to start departing soon ....\nWell ... then, do you play with the tutorial for a moment!

ID=600740137
Woof! Woof!

ID=600740138
(Now, go pick up and tidy up the wish that seems to be a witch)

ID=560074001
one! Won?

ID=560074002
(Because I felt like asking if Goodbody went well, I nodded)

ID=560074003
that? Master!\nwhere did you go?

ID=560074004
Huh! What? Have you already beaten the witch?\nWhy am I going alone ~!

ID=560074005
Did you think that ...?

ID=560074006
To, actually the witch ... I'm not alone.

ID=560074007
(... !?)

ID=560074008
Ca ...

ID=460074001
(Good boys sit down ... I understand their feelings)

ID=260074501
Hello,%username%.\nI have heard the story ... It is the first time I see this way.

ID=260074502
I am "Sora" belonging to medical team.\nIt's okay, thank you! Tehe.

ID=260074503
That ... What kind of feeling is outside recently?\nThe number of patients visiting the hospital is decreasing ... I wonder if it got better ... / /.

ID=260074504
Oh, are there such leisure?

ID=260074505
Se, Senior Captain! Well, sorry!

ID=260074506
Completely .... It seems that medical supplies have not been properly paid to members.\nJust to be sure, will you check the stock?

ID=260074507
Oh, yes. understood!\nPlease wait a moment!

ID=260074508
Oh, that ...?

ID=260074509
What's wrong?

ID=260074510
Oh, no! Well, there are stocks!\nProbably, I think that there was a deficiency in transmission! Well, I will pay you soon!

ID=260074511
Hmm ... It's suspicious.

ID=260074512
Well good. Please hurry as much as possible.\nI am going home earlier.

ID=260074513
Yes! Or, sir, I got it!

ID=260074514
......

ID=260074515
Hawaii ... This is Masui ....\nIt is serious ...!

ID=260074516
Actually ... stock of anesthesia for treatment remains a little ....

ID=260074517
It looks like an order mistake ....\nHow are you doing! What?

ID=260074518
Captain Senior was afraid ... just ....\nI'm sure this will be my ... I ....

ID=260074519
%username%! Help me! !\nIt is the biggest pinch of my life!

ID=260074520
Well, do you listen! What? Thank you!\nIt was good. With%username%, this problem is as good as it solved.

ID=260074521
%username%, do you know the word "poison and medicine is paper?"

ID=260074522
As a person engaged in medicine, I can not forgive to use medicine as a poison ....\nPoison may be used as a medicine in case of emergency.

ID=260074523
Use poison to kill people, not to kill people ... ....\nDo not you think that it is a wonderful thing! What?

ID=260074524
It's an emergency now! I think I will make poison a medicine!

ID=260074525
Do you know the monster called "Snake" that appeared on Ned Company?

ID=260074526
Long ago, members who were attacked by Snake were sometimes carried with paralysis symptoms.\nWhen I examined the ingredients to make an antidote, I found that it was almost the same ingredient as anesthesia.

ID=260074527
Did you come with a pin? That's right!\nI make anesthesia from that snake poison!

ID=260074528
So,%username%!\nWill you collect snake poison?

ID=660074501
Thank you!

ID=660074502
It is saved!\nSnake is still in Ned Company!

ID=660074503
Thank you!

ID=360074501
Please collect poison from the snake in the Ned Company.\nSo I will make anesthetic!

ID=560074501
Did you catch it?

ID=560074502
Hot ... you can make anesthesia with this.\nI'm really thankful to you!

ID=560074503
Alright, then before you sneak into Senior Captain ....

ID=560074504
Wow. What will you do before you devote to me?

ID=560074505
Hey! Se, Senior ... captain ... ....

ID=560074506
You seem to need a bit of guidance, are not you?\nHey? Sora ~? Hehuhu.

ID=560074507
Well, sorry, what!

ID=460074501
(I am afraid of Senia's face, let's escape before getting involved)

ID=260075001
Oh,%username%.\nI was waiting.

ID=260075002
Um ... to Vesi, who used to look like a child,\nDo you remember asking for a message?

ID=260075003
Actually, I also wanted to ask for something similar.

ID=260075004
A while ago, when thinking that there was a really big noise from Ned's building ....\nA big rocky Vesi appeared near the entrance of the building.

ID=260075005
Fortunately, neither I nor the children were attacked ....\nOn the contrary, children want ... to play with that Vesi.

ID=260075006
I do not mean to oppose to play with Vesi ....\nThat Veshi, Doshin! Every time it moves, the building is shaking.

ID=260075007
If the building collapses while playing ....\nAs I thought, I felt that I had better asked%username% this time, and I asked for it.

ID=260075008
It is Vesi named "Jin Steel".

ID=260075009
Please tell him that "Please play a bit further behind so that our children can not see it."

ID=260075010
(... It is not the partner that the story can communicate with, let's clean up the gin steel)

ID=660075001
Okay, thank you.

ID=360075001
Even for Vinhi called Jinsteel, "Let's play in the back so that our children can not see it!"\nPlease tell.

ID=360075002
(I will not ask you to say ... so let's clean up Jin Steel)

ID=560075001
Well, have you already gone?

ID=560075002
That's right.\nWell ... With this, everyone should be distracted.

ID=560075003
Even the previous Vesi did so,\nIt is truly a nice person to hear the story at once.

ID=560075004
(......)

ID=560075005
Oh, surely because you are%username%! Hehuhu.\nThank you very much.

ID=460075001
I look forward to working with you.

ID=260075501
Is not it a good grade to run away?

ID=260075502
How is the impression of leaving the child and running away?\nThis liars hero!

ID=260075503
Kohon ... well, well, the accident is a work incident ....\nI will give you a chance to recover.\nIf you can recover well, let's cancel a liar.

ID=260075504
Even if you let me collect information, it seems to bring back strange information,\nThis time I visited myself and gathered information.

ID=260075505
Recently, it seems that perfume used by female Vesi among adult women is rumored.

ID=260075506
Anything, it seems that if you use that perfume you will be able to seduce people.\nThat name is also "enchantment".

ID=260075507
The characteristic is that any person will make sexy adult women.\nEven if it is a child!

ID=260075508
How about? Is it different from your information? Huh.

ID=260075509
We have the "enchanting agent" as "Benin".\nAnd it seems to be in this building now.

ID=260075510
You already know what to do?\nIf you get it, I will cancel a liar.

ID=260075512
If you can stay as a liar, please come back.

ID=660075501
It is a wise judgment. Well then, please pick up 'Enchantment'.

ID=360075501
Is that okay?\nPlease take "enchantment" from Vesi "Benin" in that building.\nIt is now. Look, quickly!

ID=560075501
It looks like you got it!\nHurry up to me that ...!

ID=560075502
(I handed "enchantment" to Julie)

ID=560075503
Here, too I am an adult ...!

ID=560075504
Hey! Evil brats! What are you doing to my mentor!

ID=560075505
Ted! What? Why are you here! What?

ID=560075506
You are thinking about what time it is! What?\nIt's time for rice! Kacha - in - elder sister is looking for you ....

ID=560075507
Kurachachacha Noisy!

ID=560075508
Hey ...!

ID=560075509
He is persistent! There!

ID=560075510
Hey Hey. Even ~ both of us!\nI will be fighting soon.

ID=560075511
...! What?

ID=560075512
Hey, Sister!

ID=560075513
... Julie?\nThis is not a thing used by children? This is ....

ID=560075514
I know! Only adults can use it! What?\nIt's okay! I will be an adult now. Use this!

ID=560075515
It is not like that ....\nThis is because it uses 'Vesi'.

ID=560075516
Well ... that's not it!

ID=560075517
Well, I'm sorry, but it's true.\nHere, are you also writing here?

ID=560075518
Sounds like that ...! ! !

ID=560075519
Well then, I poured this and ate rice.

ID=560075520
Hmm! It is quite detailed!\nOh, I do not know I am weird!

ID=560075521
If you are so familiar with Vesi, how about living with Vesi! What?\nThis ... hypocrite!

ID=560075522
Hey! You! Let's do it!

ID=560075523
No matter how you interfere, I will become an adult!\nBecome an adult ... to pick up Daddy ....

ID=560075524
I'm going to get out of such a boring place!

ID=560075525
(Julie ran toward the main street)

ID=560075526
Ah! Hey! ! Clever ....\nOnee! I will bring it back! do not worry!

ID=560075527
(Ted went pursuing the Julie)

ID=560075528
......

ID=560075529
Oh,%username%. You were surprised right?\nApologize for the Julie.

ID=560075530
Julie ... It is clever and adults than other children ....\nBut yet my heart is a child.

ID=560075531
So, get ready quickly ... but I am not angry.\nFrom the Julie, it is natural that I think about myself like that.

ID=560075532
Giggle I am okay. Do not worry about Julie as well.\nTed is on. It is true to say that we are on good terms with fighting.

ID=560075533
Before dinner I will come back.

ID=560075534
%username%. Although the opponent of a child is serious,\nThank you very much for touching me with a bad face.

ID=460075501
Well, let's meet again.

ID=260076001
Kukuun ....

ID=260076002
(Good boy still does not seem to be recovering from shock)

ID=260076003
What's going on?

ID=260076004
Huh? Why the witch is not alone?\nI saw you, did not you? Two shadows of the witch ...!

ID=260076005
It is not the shadow of the witches' minions ....\nThere was a bigger woman's shadow! Two things!

ID=260076006
The moment I saw, I came with the pin! The witch is twins!\nMaster also showed us a model. So, I'm OK with just me!

ID=260076007
Good news! I can do it too!\nI will confess witches! Well! It was burning!

ID=260076008
Wan? Bow-wow!

ID=260076009
(I feel like being asked what to do for a good boy)

ID=260076010
(... I'm getting ready now, as Ted said ...)

ID=260076011
Ted! Where are you! What? Ted ~!

ID=260076012
Yeah! Kacha's older sister!

ID=260076013
Bow-wow.

ID=260076014
(There was an eye with Goodboy, I feel like I am saying this is the last chance)

ID=260076015
one! Wowon!

ID=260076016
(Good boy's feelings came in. Please hurry up and put off another witch)

ID=660076001
Kora! Good boy! Shit! Shit!\nKacha - neechan finds it! !

ID=660076002
one! Bow-wow! Wow ~ ~ ~!

ID=660076003
(now or never)

ID=360076001
(This is the last chance that Goodboy made!)

ID=360076002
(Let's clean up another witch in Ned now)

ID=560076001
one! Bow-wow!

ID=560076002
(Goodboy has an eye for cheers for good)

ID=560076003
%username%! Sorry, Ted is ....\nHere, please apologize Ted.

ID=560076004
Master ... I'm sorry to say ....\nBut, Sister! I was serious!

ID=560076005
If seriously, can you bother people?\nBesides, you should not put in there unless you are a coalition?

ID=560076006
But, there are children over there! I saw it!\nNow to the witch ...!

ID=560076007
eh? Was the child a witch's servant?\nBesides, has the other witch also defeated the master?

ID=560076008
Er! ! ! That's not my master!\nPlease also bring me ~! Even I could fight.

ID=560076009
Ted. Did%username% move for you?\nBesides, if you go over there,%username% will get angry.

ID=560076010
Because we will break the rules of the Union ....\nTed wants to annoy%username%?

ID=560076011
Is that so? Of course, I do not want to bother the master.\nIf I knew it would be such a thing .... Sorry, the master.

ID=560076012
Well, should I apologize to the Goodboy who kept Ted last?

ID=560076013
Was that right? I was wondering if I am looking forward to going on an adventure ....\nI'm sorry, Goodboy!

ID=560076014
One, Bow-wow!

ID=560076015
Hmm?

ID=560076016
one! Gurururu! one! one!

ID=560076017
(Goodboy barked while looking Ted and this alternately, and he met eyes with Ted)

ID=560076018
When I become stronger as a master, let's go with me?

ID=560076019
one!

ID=560076020
Oh! Good boy!\nAs expected it is my friend!

ID=560076021
one! One, Bow-wow!

ID=560076022
(Good boy embraced by Ted looks at it and barks)

ID=560076023
(I feel like cheers for good work)

ID=460076001
Oh? Do you know what the Goodboy is saying,%username%? Heh.

ID=460076002
Thank you for protecting Ted this time.

ID=460076003
Excuse me.

ID=260076501
%username%!\nIs it okay now?

ID=260076502
I heard an interesting story.\nDo you know "self-confident explosive"?

ID=260076503
It is a famous medicine for the tagline "Confession one push! This one!"\nAnything ... the courage to confess when I drink this and it is also the rumor that the success rate is 100% ...!

ID=260076504
It is unbelievable! What?\nThis is also reliable source information ....

ID=260076505
So from here it is important!\nIt seems that Vesi "Poison" that appeared this time has it!

ID=260076506
Could you get me a "confident explosive" from that Vesi?

ID=260076507
I, going up in front of Mr. Kacha ... I got it.\nFar from confess ... even one word is decent ....

ID=260076508
I'd like to talk to Mr. Kacha properly!\nLook closely at eyes! That is my only wish.

ID=260076509
We will prepare anything for reward!\nWould you please make my wish come true! What?

ID=660076501
It's good to be free.\nMs.%username% ... It is too cool!

ID=660076502
Okay! We look forward!

ID=360076501
My wish is to see Kacha's eyes and talk!\nTo do that, we need a "self-confident explosive" that Vesh called "Poison" is in Ned's building!

ID=560076501
Oh! It was quick!

ID=560076502
(I gave Allen "confidence explosive" to Allen)

ID=560076503
So, let's have a drink ... quickly!

ID=560076504
(Allen drank "self-confident explosive" at once)

ID=560076505
(... nothing happened)

ID=560076506
That ...? Especially I do not feel change.\nDid I change something?

ID=560076507
It has not changed ... right?\nI guess it was Gaseneta after all?

ID=560076508
(Allen began watching the bottle of "Confidential explosive")

ID=560076509
Well ... this medicine explodes your confidence explicitly and has the power to win love to you ....

ID=560076510
Hmm? Attention ... This medicine ... Ve, Vesi exclusive ...!

ID=560076511
Become It's exclusive for Vesi! What?\nWell then, why do not you have a meaning ... no?

ID=560076512
Sorry, I'm sorry! %username%!\nYou took the trouble to come ....

ID=560076513
Umm, this ... I feel a little.

ID=460076501
see you ....

ID=460076502
Writing as a person's dream ... It's fleeting ... huh.\nHuh ... Kacha-san ....

ID=260077001
Welcome!

ID=260077002
There is no opportunity to meet with Grace City quite easily! Ha ha ha!

ID=260077003
I am busy since I came here.\nIf it remains as it is, it may be in sight! Ha ha ha!

ID=260077004
But, please let me know whenever I need my strength!\nI will gladly help you! Ha ha ha!

ID=260077005
So, Rapid Flame ...? Was it?

ID=260077006
In the story you heard, to the animals they are taking,\nI heard that there are dogs that have been Mokomoko but ... is it true?

ID=260077007
If that is true ... there is a little wish.

ID=260077008
Will not you pick up the mane from that Mokomoko?

ID=260077009
Try touching what kind of thing it is and thinking about using it for materials if the quality is good!

ID=260077010
Please!

ID=660077001
Thanks!\nI'm expecting you waiting! Ha ha ha!

ID=660077002
Well then I will ask!

ID=360077001
Are you still sitting?\nIf you collect all of them please feel free to talk to me anytime!

ID=560077001
Mane ... how was it?

ID=560077002
Oh, this looks nice!\nIt is gray and inconspicuous and has no gloss.\nAlso, this texture ... perfect for protective clothing!

ID=560077003
If there is only this, research can be started, as well as production!

ID=460077001
Thanks! As expected it is Soulwerkes!

ID=460077002
This time weird strange ... oh no, I will not make experimental things, please expect it!\nHa ha ha!

ID=260077501
Oh? Did you come!\nIt's so bad, but stop them ...!

ID=260077502
(Looking at the direction that Maxim pointed out,\nMembers of the weapons operation team are somewhat rough)

ID=260077503
What happened? Maxim san.\nThis is also because of Mr. Maxim!

ID=260077504
What is for Eagle! With a mess!\nIt's your prospect, your prospects! It is fun.

ID=260077505
Well, well, I hesitate to get blood pressure as I shout so much?\nBesides, it is no use shouting at me.

ID=260077506
In the previous strategy, Mr. Maxim missed by a red gorilla\nBecause everyone got up to make themselves an enemy.

ID=260077507
What is it? !\nBesides that! Eagle did not give hands and feet to the red gorilla!

ID=260077508
Nobody has said that far. Huh.\nWell, calm down and calm down.

ID=260077509
Noisy! This kind of injury, Tsubasa Tsuyoshi ... Adeidede ....

ID=260077510
Well, can you cure the injury with a shoulder?\nThen, Mr. Maxim 's shima is to report it is a panacea! Haha.

ID=260077511
I ... but hey, now the waiters have a wait order!\nHow do you say sortie? What? Oh?

ID=260077512
Hydrofuff ... Do not worry.\nI already have the permission above. Here?

ID=260077513
"Weijin operation troops maintenance director Maxim injured in the previous battlefield.\nI ordered a red gorilla to annihilate because of morale exaltation "!

ID=260077514
If this is not complaining you? Is not it?\nYes! everyone! I got permission from Maxim! Departure!

ID=260077515
(Members gave a shout to the command of the run)

ID=260077516
(And I started getting into the tank with us)

ID=260077517
Ronin ...! Stop it! !

ID=260077518
Hmm? Why do you object? No wonder!

ID=260077519
As it is ... I heard that the eagle was made into a red gorilla,\nIt will become a fact!

ID=260077520
Besides, surely ... I have to decide to tell this story!

ID=260077521
Ahh! Something ... Any way? What?

ID=260077522
Yes ... you were there! Gahahahaha!

ID=260077523
What? Defeat the huge red gorilla before them!\nSo it's a guy wearing armor on the red body, the codename is "Carmine Beast"!

ID=260077524
... You just caught the eagle and came home by yourself?\nIf it happens ... Your men are unforgiving, are not you? Gahahaha.

ID=660077501
It's a good judgment! Gahaha.\nAll right! Then go ahead of time!

ID=360077501
Defeat the red gorilla ahead of those! I asked for it!

ID=560077501
I heard it. You said they could beat them ahead of the others?\nWell, I was saved. I wear it!

ID=560077502
That face of their faces ... apparently seems to have given up the red gorilla campaign.\nGahahahaha. This is a relief!

ID=560077503
You are in need of trouble! Gahaha.

ID=560077504
This is a personal thank you.\nReally there is ....

ID=460077501
Maxim seems not to be the only red gorilla! What?\nWhat I mean is that he is not a real culprit ....

ID=460077502
What's that story ...!

ID=460077503
(Maxim tried to raise his body, but he sat down again painfully)

ID=460077504
Is ... chase the run soon!\nhurry up! Adadada ...!

ID=260078001
that? What's wrong?

ID=260078002
(It is seen as a giroshiro by people around the weapons operation force)

ID=260078003
Just a bit! Even simple grand mothers, if you do not get stared like that!\nHere, please return to your own place!

ID=260078004
(While watching the chill, they all went back to their place as the run says)

ID=260078005
Ah, sorry? So, what for?\nOh, I understand. Maxim said to him, did not he?

ID=260078006
Well right. There was something I wanted to ask you.

ID=260078007
Hey, besides "Carmine Beast\

ID=260078008
It's not huge but is it a small one called "Crimson Beast"?\nFluff ... after all.

ID=260078009
Everyone! It's still red gorillas!\nLet's do it this time!

ID=260078010
(When the run shouts so, everyone raises a shout at once)

ID=260078011
(I started getting on the tank with us)

ID=260078012
Or, stop it ...!

ID=260078013
(You can see the face of Maksim desperately appealing)

ID=260078014
(......)

ID=660078001
(It seems necessary to go)

ID=360078001
Take care ... I hate that ... ahead of time ...!

ID=360078002
(It seems like a real deal, go ahead and defeat Crimson Beast)

ID=560078001
Oh no!\nIt's useless this time.

ID=560078002
Gahahaha! I do not wake up if I fall down.\nWhen I fell down I did a first shot!

ID=560078003
So do not push yours too.\nPlease accept only your feelings gratefully! Gahahaha.

ID=560078004
(......)

ID=560078005
Well ....

ID=560078006
(The run alternately saw Maxim's face here)

ID=560078007
Oh - that kind of thing?

ID=560078008
sorry? I ask Mr. Maxim to go out for selfishness.\nIt seems you ought to be okay.

ID=560078009
This is a boring thing, but I will repay on behalf of my troops.

ID=460078001
......

ID=460078002
Um ....\nCan I ask one?

ID=460078003
Why do not you say you did it?\nIt looks like Mr. Maxim's hand.

ID=460078004
... I see.\nFor you, that does not matter.

ID=460078005
Haha. I see.\nSo ... you ....

ID=460078006
Oh, sorry. Nothing! Ah-ha.

ID=460078007
Thank you always for Maxim!\nSee you ~!

ID=260078501
Oh, it's been a long time. %username%.

ID=260078502
I have been busy lately and I have not had time to talk.

ID=260078503
There are many deficits when I was in Kandathi ....\nI was desperately filling it.

ID=260078504
But, there are a lot of people here in Grace City,\nThe deficit of Kandas city will be managed somehow.

ID=260078505
By the way, here again ... This is a flying flying ... What was your name ...?

ID=260078506
Oh, that's it! Intention Carla!

ID=260078507
In the story I heard it seems that the beak of that "intention carra" is quite durable,\nI'm a bit curious.

ID=260078508
So ... I would like you to bring that intention Carla's beak.\nCan you do something for me?

ID=260078509
I thought that we could sell at that high price if we processed the beak at the merchant association and sold it.

ID=660078501
Thank you very much. I do not need much quantity.\nWhy are you okay if you get it properly for the first time.

ID=660078502
by the way ....\nI have not been seeing you recently because I am busy ... Do you know what you are doing with Jight?

ID=660078503
Huh? Are you trying to make something about the jite?\nHmm ... It is uneasy not to be like Jite.

ID=360078501
I would like you to bring the beak of the intention Carla.

ID=360078502
Jay is making a new thing ....

ID=360078503
I can not lose to Jite.\nPlease bring a beak in a hurry!

ID=560078501
Thank you for your hard work. Did you get the beak of Intention Carla?

ID=560078502
Indeed, this is the intention Carla's beak ....\nIt looks like it is not durable than I thought.

ID=560078503
Well, this is what we process ... ...!

ID=560078504
(The intention Carla's beak fell to the ground and shattered)

ID=560078505
......

ID=560078506
Who says this is sturdy ...?

ID=460078501
Huh ... this time wastefulness .... I'm sorry ....

ID=260079001
Mr.%username%, I ... I can not withdraw as it is.

ID=260079002
I tried to investigate, but it seems there are various kinds of Carla besides the intention carra.\nI'm sorry, but can not you do it again ...?

ID=260079003
I would like you to bring the beak that seems to be the strongest in Carla.

ID=260079004
I have rewarding properly this time, so please do athing.

ID=660079001
Thank you very much.\nI hope you find it properly next time.

ID=660079002
Fuu, Ah ... what does the Jite do ...?

ID=660079003
Huh? No! And I'm not worried!\nI was just worried because it is a rival with the same merchant! Do not get me wrong!

ID=660079004
Do not truly misunderstand me!\nPlease do not tell Jite!

ID=360079001
Bring me a beak from a sturdy Carla!

ID=560079001
this is ...?

ID=560079002
Is the beak collected from Carla called Armored Carla ...?

ID=560079003
I see ... It is just like an armor.\nThank you very much. It seems to be a proper thing after a long absence.

ID=460079001
I do not think where to use this.\nThank you,%username%.

ID=260079501
long time no see? How have you been?

ID=260079502
Ha ha ha. Are you worried about me more than myself?\nI am concentrating on my treatment now ... Good condition.

ID=260079503
I thought that I was still active.\nTo be worried even by such a young man ... I do not want to get old.

ID=260079504
By the way, have you been in the blank for fifteen years?\nThen ... maybe you are watching me when I was young.

ID=260079505
What did you do 15 years ago?\nHmm, 15 years ago ... It was a major pillar of an ordinary family.

ID=260079506
With my wife and my son living alone.\nIt was a very ordinary family to love and to be loved.

ID=260079507
At that time I felt burdened as "the main pillar of the family".\nBut for the first time I lost ... I noticed that it was my support.

ID=260079508
Haha, do not mind. Everyone loses those who I love, I live over that sorrow.\nI am only one of them.

ID=260079509
To young people of the future, we must talk about a dream.\nOh yeah, I was dreaming of an athlete when you were a kid.

ID=260079510
what do you think it is? Listen and be amazed.\n... "Boxer".

ID=260079511
Ha ha ha! Everyone initially reacts like that.\nLaugh as much as you want. Against a young man, a smile suits you.

ID=260079512
Tell me, it used to be smart now.\nWhen I was young, I have a lot of blood, and my future was also promising.

ID=260079513
There was no one standing by eating my punch.\nIs it true? It looks like I can not believe it.

ID=260079514
Try asking "Maxim" of the weapons operation force.\nMaxim is an old friend, I know each other well.

ID=260079515
I should also understand the meaning that I joined the combat unit "Force Strike".\nNo, at first glance it is said to be like a hundred. It may be earlier if you showed direct fighting.

ID=260079516
Recently, there is a man in the executive class code name "Red main" in the operational area.\nI will participate in the campaign to kill it.

ID=260079517
It was a strategy that you were supposed to ask, but it is just right.\nDo you move your body for the first time in a while. I hope you are absent. Ha ha ha.

ID=260079518
Is the body okay? Do not worry about it.\nI have not cured it completely, but this is about breakfast.

ID=260079519
(I really want to join ... I began to wireless somewhere)

ID=260079520
Tall? I thought about moving the body after a long time.\nIt is a campaign to kill the code name "Red Main". Reasons to go out directly?

ID=260079521
Ha ha ha. I can not lose to young people.\nHey, do not worry. Okay.

ID=660079501
(You can really go if you do not like it. Go ahead and defeat Red Maine)

ID=360079501
Tall, I am fine.\ndo not worry. What also comes to the campaign 'Redmain' and other preparatory exercises.

ID=360079502
(... Hurry up)

ID=560079501
What's going on in such a hurry?\ncalm down. Here, deep breath. Suha.

ID=560079502
Is it the Red Main?\nOh, Tall is in opposition too.\nI think I will go personally. Departure a little more ....

ID=560079503
what? Have you already killed him? you? It is a good gratitude that it is a violation of the order.\n... Ha ha ha! just kidding. Did you work hard at the old man?

ID=560079504
I would not beat Rapid Flame 's executive class "next".\nThere will not be any other things you can do such a thing.

ID=560079505
Whatever it was, the crew was in trouble, so I was saved.\nIf I had gone, it would have been more troubling in a different way. Ha ha ha.

ID=560079506
After all it is as usual.\nThen, I have to pay for it. Here, take it.

ID=460079501
I am sorry I can not show my courage.

ID=260080001
Hello! %username%!

ID=260080002
Recently, I heard that the mission is being carried out on the expressway ....\nIs your body OK?

ID=260080003
It seems healthy and has anything else.\nOh, that's right. Do you know% beat type 'crawler' by%username%?

ID=260080004
It is a suicide bomber when you feel dangerous to yourself,\nEr ... It looks like a bug on the back of a green egg.

ID=260080005
Actually, I am interested in that "crawler" recently.\nI was like an insect and I was wondering if it was the same kind ....

ID=260080006
The bodily fluid of that insect can be used for "treatment".\nBut, that insect ... It is a rare species.

ID=260080007
So, if there is a similar therapeutic effect on body fluid of "crawler"\nIt will be easy to make many medicines!

ID=260080008
Huh? Do you touch body fluid directly to collect?\nof course! Tehe.

ID=260080009
It's okay! Seoul workers have various resistance,\nI will not do it without touching it! ... maybe?

ID=260080010
Tehe.

ID=660080001
Well then, thank you! Okay!

ID=660080002
(Sora has gone away)

ID=660080003
(I think that collection is also difficult if it is self-destructed to the crawler ...)

ID=660080004
(Let's clean up without saying anything)

ID=360080001
The crawler seems to be making a herd near the 2nd expressway.\nI think that you will understand, so thank you!

ID=560080001
Welcome back.\nUmm ... what about crawlers?

ID=560080002
(I told Sora once again that the crawler will suicide)

ID=560080003
Ah ... that was right!\nI ... I do not have such a crucial thing ....

ID=560080004
Excuse me! I have taken a wasteful step ....

ID=560080005
This is ... I feel like apologizing ... ....

ID=460080001
Uh ... I'm really sorry!

ID=260080501
Oh! I came! I heard the story.\nBecause the white bear was likely to be unreasonable, did he perform the mission instead?

ID=260080502
Who is it, Haruka? Gahaha.\nI do not know that you do not even know the nickname of your commander.

ID=260080503
White bears are "hype". Although it seems that it looks like an appearance,\nIt got ridiculous when it got into battle, so that nickname appeared.

ID=260080504
Did you also tell me the relationship between Eagle and Heights?\nWell, you also talked about your punch?\nBecause I like old tales, he is.

ID=260080505
Normally it is not such a thing, but suddenly it will prosper when it comes to boxing story.\nThat's it from a young age, so it was sold with fights. Gahaha.

ID=260080506
That is why the eagle stopped him who was making a drawn attention and selling quarrels.\nWithout my eagle, he was not here by now.

ID=260080507
I want to have one of appreciation as well.\nIt is all thanks to Eagle that there is a present right now! Gahaha.

ID=260080508
What is it, what?\nI can not believe it! What?

ID=260080509
Let's show it if you do! That's right.\nRecently the code name "Red Main" has appeared again, you must believe it if you defeat him! What?

ID=260080510
All right! Do not worry! As evidence, I'll bring home 'Kukuri' and come back!\nWash your neck and wait ~ ~? I'll show you the greatness of Eagle!

ID=260080511
what? What do not you think you are lying?\nWell ~, the words and facial expression do not match!\nEagle knows ... your true heart is!

ID=260080512
Wait a moment! Go with Papachu ... Warm!

ID=260080513
(Maxim tried to get up, but caught painfully)

ID=260080514
I will not be worried. The previous scratch only hurts a little.\nEven such a fart ... Nuwoo!

ID=260080515
(Maxim tried to get up again, but caught painfully)

ID=260080516
What a clue ...! Muho!

ID=260080517
(......)

ID=260080518
(It resembles Hype and ... kind calls a friend ...)

ID=260080519
(Defeat Red Main before this time, bring "Kukuri")

ID=660080501
Wait, wait! Where are you going to go! Come on ... Eagle!

ID=660080502
(... let's go)

ID=360080501
I am worried about you, I will show you the greatness of Eagle, I will show you ... Oh!

ID=360080502
(... hurry to defeat Red Main and bring "Kukuri")

ID=560080501
You ... where you are going! What?\nWait a moment, please! From now on Red Main ...!

ID=560080502
(I gave Redmain "Kukuri" to Maxim)

ID=560080503
This guy is the red main weapon 'Kukuri'!\nThat means ... you! What?

ID=560080504
Have you already knocked down! What?\nWell, young people are jealous.

ID=560080505
I'm sorry I was seriously out of now.\nHave you done ahead! Gahaha.

ID=560080506
Red Main also twice you. I guess it has not emerged anymore.\nThe way it is ... the greatness of the eagle that protected the white bear in the shade was handed down as a legend ... ....

ID=560080507
Who kept who?

ID=560080508
Gahaha. That's right ... yeah?\nOh, what a fuckin 'you do if you rumor!

ID=560080509
Long time no see, Maxim.\nYou look as usual as usual, you are.

ID=560080510
You are safe without sleeping at the hospital bed! What?

ID=560080511
When are you talking. I was discharged from hospital.\nWould it be okay for you to do so?

ID=560080512
I thought who you are eagle! What?\nI will not enter in such a bruise.\nIt is not worrying.

ID=560080513
If it is fine just do not worry.\nYes, I got a good liquor ... How about a cup after a long time?

ID=560080514
Oh! What? Sounds good! let's do it!\nThat's it! How about you too! What?

ID=460080501
Really. Well it's not fun to get sandwiched between old folds and drink! Gahahaha.\nTake care and return!

ID=260081001
I came to a good place.

ID=260081002
A contact from a member who is alert on the front line.\nMany intention carlas are gathering around Queen Carla.

ID=260081003
Apparently, it seems that you are planning an air raid to Grace City.

ID=260081004
However, the arrangement of the anti-aircraft gun has already been completed.\nIt will not be a problem so much.

ID=260081005
However, worrying about the number of intentional carls ....

ID=260081006
Although there is an anti-aircraft gun, there is even an emergency.\nIn a situation where human life is underway, that "emergency" should not happen.

ID=260081007
So, I want you to kill Queen Carla.

ID=260081008
We watch the match and make a brief stop at Carla who lost the leader.

ID=260081009
We will also do our utmost to support you.\nI'm counting on you.

ID=660081001
Then, the task begins.

ID=360081001
The annihilation of Queen Carla that appeared near the second expressway is the mission.\nI can not leave him alone.

ID=560081001
I already have a report.\nIt was a pain.

ID=560081002
You do not have to worry about escaping Queen Carla.\nIt is important that we could clear out the gathering Carla.

ID=560081003
Despite the sudden mission, thank you for carrying out admirably.

ID=460081001
Go home and have a good rest. It was a hard time.

ID=260081501
one! Bow-wow! one!

ID=260081502
Ah! Master! Hey!

ID=260081503
Well, Goodboy was waiting for a teacher!

ID=260081504
Goodbody's guy, towards the highway for a couple of days,\nI was barking all the time. It looks like I'm looking for something.

ID=260081505
I hesitate to ask you if there is something there.\nSomehow, it seemed to be waiting for someone.

ID=260081506
Then the master came and the good boy suddenly barked,\nThe waiters were masters, were not they. What? Good boy.

ID=260081507
Bow-wow!

ID=260081508
(Good Boy barking while watching over, chewed the sleeve and pulled towards the highway)

ID=260081509
that? Perhaps there is something the Goodboy wants the teacher to find?

ID=260081510
Woof! Woof!

ID=260081511
Do not you think so? Yup! There is no doubt this reaction!\nBut what would you like me to find? What? Good boy! Give me a hint!

ID=260081512
(Goodboy brought ID tag from where)

ID=260081513
Is this ... a necklace? I want you to find something like this! What?

ID=260081514
one! Wowon!

ID=260081515
Who has it?

ID=260081516
one! Gurururu! one! Wowon!

ID=260081517
(After a Goodboy barked at the highway, he showed a nice swing to enlarge his body)

ID=260081518
A highway ... Is that a monster?\nWhat is that a monster on the highway?

ID=260081519
Woof! Woof!

ID=260081520
(I gave charm to Ted as if the Goodboy said it was the correct answer)

ID=260081521
To Hehe. Master! On the highway, I want you to find such a necklace!\nBut it looks like the monster has it ....

ID=660081501
Is that okay?\nWow! Truly a hero! There is only my master!

ID=660081502
Woof! Woof!

ID=660081503
Well, my master! be careful!\nFight! Oh! !

ID=660081504
Guru ~! Wowon!

ID=360081501
Bow-wow! Gurururu! Wowon!

ID=360081502
Goodboy says that there are monsters with such a necklace on the highway.\nWell, I want him to get that necklace from him.

ID=560081501
Woof! Woof!

ID=560081502
Huh? I have already been to! What? Was there a necklace?

ID=560081503
(I passed an ID tag to Goodboy and Ted)

ID=560081504
There is something written.\n... Well, "Chris"?

ID=560081505
one! Bow-wow, Bow-wow!

ID=560081506
Well, what 's wrong, Goodbody.

ID=560081507
(Goodboy barked for a while for keeping the ID tag in front of him)

ID=560081508
... This is the one of that uncle.\nHere, the old man who was playing with the good boy I taught last time.

ID=560081509
That uncle, "Chris" is said.\nBut why is the uncle of his uncle a highway monster ...?

ID=560081510
Well ... No way ... ... you died?

ID=560081511
Woof! Woof!

ID=560081512
(Goodboy handed out the ID tag)

ID=560081513
Why to make it a teacher?

ID=560081514
One, Bow-wow! Won!

ID=560081515
Good boy ...?

ID=460081501
(Good boys are different from usual, there seems to be different wishes)

ID=260082001
One, one, one! Wowon!

ID=260082002
(Goodbody began to bark in the direction of Starry Forest Union Headquarters)

ID=260082003
(I feel like saying that you bring this ID tag to the Star Forest Coalition Headquarters)

ID=260082004
Huh? Then, his master! ... ... Going?

ID=260082005
But, if you told me that my uncle is gone now ....

ID=260082006
one. one!

ID=260082007
(Goodboy caught Ted's sleeve and matched eyes with Ted)

ID=260082008
You ... You actually knew?\nIt is strong ... Good boy.

ID=260082009
one! Bow-wow!

ID=260082010
(Ted sat in front of Goodboy and Goodboy delighted Ted)

ID=260082011
Master, come and go!\nI am waiting here with a good boy.

ID=660082001
Woof! Woof!

ID=660082002
(It barks as if saying that a good boy is coming)

ID=660082003
(I'm heavy but I will go)

ID=360082001
(Let's show ID tag to Toll)

ID=600820101
(I passed an ID tag to Toll)

ID=600820102
Here, this is Captain of Chris ...! Where was it?\nNo matter how much I looked it could not be found ... I was giving up ....

ID=600820103
Is it the place where Captain Chris is?

ID=600820104
Captain Chris was ... darted in a certain strategy.\nWhy does your company do such a thing?

ID=600820105
(I talked to him in the past)

ID=600820106
Really .... That dog "Goodboy" is Captain of Chris ....

ID=600820107
Then, let's return this to that dog ....\nLet me tell you about my bereaved family.

ID=600820108
When a pet finds the ID tag of the deceased owner ... the inner corner will get hot.\nI should praise that dog a lot. You did a fine job.

ID=600820109
After that, if you do not have to wait for the return of the husband again,\nPlease tell me that it was hard work until now.

ID=600820110
(... Go back to the good boy)

ID=560082001
Woof! Woof!

ID=560082002
Welcome back! Master ...?

ID=560082003
Ah! My teacher also came back,\nOh, I ... I will return home! See ya!

ID=560082004
Good boy! No matter what happens, you are my friend! ! Do not forget!

ID=560082005
Woof! Woof!

ID=560082006
(Ted looks at the eyes of Goodboy and said that Ted did not look back and went back)

ID=560082007
One, Bow-wow.

ID=560082008
(Goodboy had eyes decided to prepare.The ID tag of Captain Chris and told the story heard on Thor)

ID=560082009
... one! Bow-wow! Wowon! Bow-wow!

ID=560082010
(Goodboy began to bark hard at looking at the highway)

ID=560082011
(Let me sit silent now)

ID=460082001
(In the city, the good boy's singing voice that condemn the master was echoed)

ID=260082501
Hey, you?

ID=260082502
Oh! You came a lot!\nThat's it! You should ask yourself!

ID=260082503
What's wrong? my mother. Actually ...

ID=260082504
Eagle and white bear! Choose which one!

ID=260082505
Come on Maxim. What are you going to do with such abrupt abductions.\nI will explain circumstances properly.

ID=260082506
Oh no! Gahaha!\nOnly impatient people around me.\nIt seems that eagles came to it!

ID=260082507
Ha ha ha. Which mouth is saying?\nIs your impatience a long time ago?

ID=260082508
That's right! Gahaha!

ID=260082509
Oops, the talk deviated.\nHey, Eagle and Koits, which one seems to be strong! What?

ID=260082510
Once in the past, I was talking about who protected who, but I can not keep it.\nYou just appeared there.

ID=260082511
Suddenly I'm sorry, but could you answer me?\nWhich one seems to be strong?

ID=260082512
Well, I guess it is impossible, after all?\nDoes anyone who honestly answers the highest commander before?

ID=260082513
Yeah I see.... Definitely not fair.

ID=260082514
Oh, no matter how much the eagle seems to be strong,\nI will choose you as the supreme commander with a social expression.

ID=260082515
Hmm ... What is it ....

ID=260082516
If it comes to such anymore, you only have to prove it?

ID=260082517
Certification ...?

ID=260082518
Ow! You see, it appeared on the 2nd freeway ... Rapid 's executive class ....\nFalcon? Is it serious?

ID=260082519
I see.\nSince the suppression of Falcon, why do not you defeat the illusion of Falcon that it will appear on the highway and prove it?

ID=260082520
Bingo! It is truly a friend of an eagle!\nHowever, be sure to bring back the loot!

ID=260082521
Good. It makes sense.\nMy arms rings.

ID=260082522
(They began to rampage because they could not suppress excitement)

ID=260082523
If you decide so! If you go hunting quickly ... wipe it! !

ID=260082524
(Maxim tried to rise suddenly, but caught painfully)

ID=260082525
Whew, it is a miserable person.\nWell, I'm letting you go first ... Well.

ID=260082526
(Hype also tried to get up but crouched down painfully)

ID=260082527
Gahaha! You are sloppy!\nWhy do not you recommend a hospital visit?

ID=260082528
Ha ha ha. I will return that word exactly as it is.\nYou also have not been completely caught injury yet?

ID=260082529
(The two men are competing with each other 's meaning)

ID=660082501
(... Defeat the illusion of Falcon before this time, let's pick up the loot)

ID=660082502
Gahaha! Eagle can stand up as long as a minute!

ID=660082503
Ha ha ha. Then I need 50 seconds!

ID=660082504
Gahahaha!

ID=660082505
Hahaha!

ID=660082506
(... Let's go quickly)

ID=360082501
(Defeat the phantom of Falcon that it appeared on the second expressway and return home with the loot)

ID=560082501
Your Did you come back!\nDid you think that I felt like I had tasted you back? Gahahaha.

ID=560082502
I heard about the story of beating the illusion of Falcon.\nIs it a "remnant of Queen Carla"?

ID=560082503
(He handed "Queen Carla's debris" to Hype)

ID=560082504
Sorry about that. It involves you in the conflict of our nature.

ID=560082505
Well, it has become impossible to prove which one is strong by you.\nI had thought about letting a cock full of bubbles for the first time in a while.

ID=560082506
Let's keep it around.\nSorry. The conflict of nature is stopping already.

ID=560082507
Actually, I tried to chase after listening to the story that you headed for the highway,\nDo not ask yourself what the body says. It was only finally here to come.

ID=560082508
No matter what kind of injury he used to be, he ran around the battlefield as if nothing had happened the next day.\nI am a human being. It seems not to be able to reverse to the flow of time.

ID=560082509
Do you think so too? I am also there.\nWell, that's common sense.

ID=560082510
However, it is still alive.\nAs long as we are alive, there must be something we can only do.

ID=560082511
So, I am here even when I am old. Different?

ID=560082512
Oh, I see.

ID=560082513
Maxim ... you have one request.

ID=560082514
What?

ID=560082515
Do not go ahead of me.\nLet's live long together.

ID=560082516
Hey hey, hey hey.\nDid you drink too much and you got strange? Gahahaha.

ID=560082517
Ha ha ha. It may be.

ID=560082518
You are the one who will not pass away before the eagle?\nAlso fix that character that suddenly becomes embarrassing.

ID=560082519
Oh, I see.\nOops, I told a waste in front of the young man.

ID=560082520
Thank you for dating me.\nIt was fun. It's been a long time since I went to see young people.

ID=560082522
Gahahaha. Totally! Jiji two people's hard work!\nThis is a little feeling. Receive.

ID=460082501
Well, be careful and return! See you!

ID=260083001
Ah! I was waiting,%username%!

ID=260083002
Sorry to bother you, I am busy ....

ID=260083003
This request may take a while.

ID=260083004
That ... that Kacha's enemy will be avenged,\nIt's a big project.

ID=260083005
Actually, I met Kuracha a few days ago,\nI had a very uneasy face.

ID=260083006
No matter what I asked you did not answer.\nSo, when I asked children in nursing homes ....

ID=260083007
Apparently inside of Vesi that appeared in Dave Town\nIt seems like Karocha's enemy is there.

ID=260083008
So, on behalf of weak Kacha, I decided to take an enemy.

ID=260083009
Children also talked about various things.\nHowever, everything concerning this matter is disjointed, and the only thing I knew ....

ID=260083010
The other party is ... It is a man 's Vesi.

ID=260083011
However, because the range is too big for this, I kept collecting thought to narrow down more.\nIt is different after all and it is different from getting to a fight ... what is already what ....

ID=260083012
but! Finally I could narrow the candidate to two big!

ID=260083013
First of all, as a result of focusing information on men who have big weapons ....\nA Vesi called "Jin Samaran" came up.

ID=260083014
But, here is the problem. It is said that there are several Jin Samana,\nTo Dave Town, we can not go anywhere except members of the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=260083015
So ... I called you%username%.

ID=260083016
It is easy to ask%username%.\nI attach a small camera to the clothes of%username%.

ID=260083017
And beat that Jinsanarner with it!\nThat's all!

ID=260083018
Why are you shooting? That's it ....\nIt is because it is a strategy to have Kacha see that picture and find an enemy.

ID=260083019
how is it? Could you do it? What?

ID=660083001
Thank you!\nSo I will attach the camera to the clothes soon.

ID=660083002
(Allen attaches camera to clothes)

ID=660083003
accomplished. Well, thank you!

ID=360083001
Please defeat all Jin Samanas in Dave Town!\nPlease!

ID=560083001
I was waiting!\nQuickly get the camera data ....

ID=560083002
(Allen began to operate the camera)

ID=560083003
Well, I was ready.\nThen ... then.

ID=560083004
Huh? Why do you like Kacha? Suddenly, what's wrong?

ID=560083005
Well, uhh ... is that.\nPlease do not tease?

ID=560083006
Actually ... My house is a famous family with medicine making,\nIt is also an old noble of this Grace City.

ID=560083007
In that relationship, we supported kindergarten facilities operated by Mr. Kacha by the teachings of the family.\nOne day I heard a story that Julie was deposited at the facility.

ID=560083008
Oh, I am acquainted with Julie from a long time ago.\nFrom Julie's father, I learned programming.

ID=560083009
Well, that's why I visited a nursing home to see the jury.\nAt that time, I first met Mr. Kacha.

ID=560083010
In self-introduction, I said "I am a robot developer."\nNormally it is said that "Why is it a robot?" Though he is famous for his medicine making.

ID=560083011
However, Mr. Kacha said "It's a nice job!\nHe said that children are going to adore that robot making ... ".\nIt was my first time to say such a thing, so I'm very happy ....

ID=560083012
From that moment I fell in love with Katja.

ID=560083013
Something embarrassing! Ah ha ha.

ID=560083014
Goong! That's why I'd like to do something for Mr. Kacha.

ID=460083001
Let's move on to the next step!

ID=260083501
Master! Hey boy

ID=260083502
Finally found out!

ID=260083503
That! Can a teacher go to Dave Town?

ID=260083504
Hooray! Ah ... well, there is a use for Dave Town ...!\nOh, no it is not so ....

ID=260083505
Actually ... I have a house in Dave Town that used to live a long time ago.\nI do not have anyone now.

ID=260083506
Oh my Dad, huh! It was a signboard craftsman!\nThe signboard of my dad shined shiny and cool.

ID=260083507
Like a master, it was my hero!\nI love you, Mr. Dad.

ID=260083508
Oh, what I want to say is not this.\nSo, when I was still able to go to Dave Town, I was occasionally home.

ID=260083509
Now I can not enter if I am a member of the Star Forest Alliance.\nI thought that it was time to go today, I went to where I could see Davetown.

ID=260083510
Then a monster like a wolf was holding Dad's electric cable!\nSo, if you tried to chase him, you were stopped by the man 's uncle ....

ID=260083511
Master! That is a very important thing!\n... It's my father's memento.

ID=260083512
I thought that it would be toys to everyone if I bring it here.\nIf it is such a thing ....

ID=260083513
Even if I tell his uncle, I do not want it because it's dangerous ....\nSo ... please!

ID=260083514
There are only teachers anymore!

ID=660083501
Is it good?

ID=660083502
Thank you! Truly a master!

ID=660083503
Really thank you so much!

ID=360083501
A monster like a wolf was holding Dad's electric cable!\nTake it back from him! It is a memento of Dad! Please!

ID=560083501
How was it?

ID=560083502
(I handed the electric cable to Ted)

ID=560083503
Certainly there are tooth shapes around here ... Oh, this! Dad's!

ID=560083504
Master ... Thank you very much.\nIt is my benefactor.

ID=560083505
Hey master. Why do you have a tooth profile here?

ID=560083506
Long ago, I used this and I followed my hero with my dad.\nMy father is a hero and I am a hero egg!

ID=560083507
On that day, I played a role to be caught by the bad guy,\nDad used the cable, saying, "This kind of reality is necessary."

ID=560083508
But, Dad said, "Stay stronger Ted! Please solve with your own power!"\nSo I tried to cut a thousand. That is why this tooth profile was attached. Hehe.

ID=560083509
It was fun. However, she misunderstood that she was on the burglar when she saw that.\nJust because Dad looked like a bad guy ....

ID=560083510
Oh, that ... Gusut. He ...\nWell, that's why I was stabbed by my father ...!

ID=560083511
......

ID=560083512
Anyways! I decided to become such a cable man like that!\nhero of justice! Cable man!

ID=560083513
Cable man? Huh.\nYou look good on you!

ID=560083514
Oh, evil! What are you doing! What?

ID=560083515
Evil brats ...! What? Hey ... No, I will settle down ... It is not this guy that has a purpose.\nFuu ... Hey you.

ID=560083516
Hey! Call me master, not you!

ID=560083517
I heard the story that I can go to Dave Town, but is it true?

ID=560083518
From, evil girls! Ignore them!

ID=460083501
There is a favor to ask,\nCan you listen?

ID=260084001
Hey ... can you keep following me?\nYou must play idiot.

ID=260084002
Do you think I will make two villagers and teachers like you yourself?

ID=260084003
Really annoying guy. You may follow me, but keep silent.

ID=260084004
Okay, I understand.

ID=260084005
Funk! Well ... why I called you,\nBecause I saw a person who seems to be my dad in Dave Town.

ID=260084006
Huh? What? I do not think so! You are still ...!

ID=260084007
Noisy! You told me to keep silent! What?\nIf you feel like disturbing, it will not be free!

ID=260084008
Do it!\nMud Milky! ! I do not know anymore! Have it your way!

ID=260084009
(Ted got angry back home)

ID=260084010
Huh, finally there was no way out of the way.\nWell, I will continue with the story.

ID=260084011
The figure I saw near the entrance of Dave Town was broken in one arm.\nDad also ... I was folding one's arm. So, I thought that that person is a dad ....

ID=260084012
I can not be convinced ... If it were for daddy, that place was dangerous!\nPlease think that it is life saving, please bring back.

ID=260084013
Will you do it?

ID=660084001
(As long as I hear the story, I feel like a single leg ... just to be sure to check it)

ID=660084002
Thank you very much. Please hurry.

ID=360084001
I saw a person who broke her arm in Dave Town. Because my dad was also broken her arm, maybe ....\nPlease think that it is life saving, please bring back.

ID=360084002
(As long as I hear the story, I feel like a single leg ... just to be sure to check it)

ID=560084001
Welcome back. Was that person a father?

ID=560084002
(Julie said that shadow was a single leg and no one was there)

ID=560084003
Is that so ....

ID=560084004
It was good!\nThere should not be a dad in such a dangerous place!

ID=560084005
It was good .... Yup ....

ID=460084001
So, in this I ...!

ID=460084002
Master teacher! I waited for a moment!

ID=460084003
Ha ha .. Master ... to me! ...!

ID=460084004
Lend me your strength!

ID=260084501
Hello. %username%.

ID=260084502
Recently I've heard that you are busy with Dave Town,\nMy complexion is not good ... are you resting properly?

ID=260084503
Well ... I can not help myself asking this ....

ID=260084504
Huh? Is there something wrong?\nThat ... ... Dave Town has become an out of bounds area.

ID=260084505
Over there, my grandmother's house ....\nOh my grandmother is already dead, now I am vacant.

ID=260084506
It was a place full of memories when I was young, so I went to clean up occasionally.\nHowever, listening to the fact that it was not trespassing ... I wonder if the house is safe.

ID=260084507
So, if only%username% is good, I thought you could check on the mission.

ID=260084508
Um! Kirt teacher ~!\nI was injured ~! It hurts!

ID=260084509
Well yeah yeah yeah.

ID=260084510
Excuse me! I have to go!

ID=260084511
(Katja has gone)

ID=260084512
I did not hear what kind of house ... but maybe you can go to Dave Town?

ID=660084501
(Tentatively ... Let's look for it)

ID=360084501
I did not hear what kind of house ... but maybe you can go to Dave Town?

ID=560084501
Oh,%username%. What happened?

ID=560084502
(I tried going to Dave Town but told me I did not know which house)

ID=560084503
Well! You did not have to do it.\n%username% is a sincere person. Huff.

ID=560084504
Thank you very much!\nThere would have been a lot of houses ... It was kind of a hard work.

ID=560084505
Okay ... What are you saying then?

ID=460084501
One ... can you ask me a favor?

ID=260085001
During this time, when I went near Dave Town,\nThe Star Forest Alliance taught me ....

ID=260085002
A male Vesi ... I heard that he brought a picture of me and her grandmother.

ID=260085003
I do not know the reason, but ....\nThat picture is the only picture I took with my grandmother.

ID=260085004
If you do not mind, will you recover the photo from that one?\nAnd please tell us, "Since it is an important thing, you should not take it without permission".

ID=260085005
It may not be able to communicate with Rapid Flame, though. Huh.

ID=660085001
Thank you very much. %username%.

ID=360085001
Please be careful and go.

ID=560085001
Thank you for your good work.

ID=560085002
(I handed "burned photo" to Katja)

ID=560085003
Well, it's a burning photo ....\nYou had a hard time.

ID=560085004
Is it strange that they are familiar?

ID=560085005
If that is the case ....

ID=560085006
I knew Rapid Flame ....

ID=560085007
Teacher ~! I cried again!

ID=560085008
Teacher - Where ~?

ID=560085009
Well yeah yeah yeah.

ID=560085010
Oh no, I can not talk slowly this. Huh.\nThe rest is again this time.

ID=460085001
Well then. Well, the teacher is here ~!

ID=260085501
The second candidate seems to be a feature that it is strong in macho, and as a result of investigating the likely Vesi,\nA vein called "Jin Python" emerged.

ID=260085502
The target is "Jin Python"!\nAs expected it was impossible to identify anything but a name.

ID=260085503
So please wear your camera this time and defeat the enemy!

ID=260085504
Since the data chips have been changed in advance,\nYou are welcome to go straight!

ID=660085501
Well, thank you!

ID=360085501
Please defeat all the Vesi called Jin Python who is in Dave Town.\nI asked for it! What?

ID=560085501
Welcome back.

ID=560085502
Ha ... It was kind of a hard work ....

ID=560085503
(Allen took the camera out of his clothes with a depressed face)

ID=560085504
Umm ... I have bad news.

ID=560085505
Kacha's enemy we were pursuing ... There seems to be no more.\nI'm sorry ... It has resulted in a wasteful step ....

ID=560085506
Then ... Huh ....

ID=560085507
That enemy ... It seems he had put Kacha's loved ones in his hand.\nAnd Mr. Kacha still now ... that person ....

ID=560085508
Just like this ....

ID=560085509
It's clown ....

ID=560085510
But! I will not give up!\nOh, love ... it's what you win!

ID=560085511
......

ID=560085512
Huh ....

ID=460085501
Thank you ... I made a noise. %username%.

ID=460085502
Have a nice day ....\nHuh ....

ID=260086001
What is sudden! What happened?

ID=260086002
Master ... I heard that ....\nWhat happened in Dave Town!

ID=260086003
The old man in Davetown was saying ....\nA monstrous point of monsters appeared, and everyone's eating a soul ....

ID=260086004
...! !

ID=260086005
Master! If I break that point, I guess the soul will come back?

ID=260086006
Wait a minute! What are you talking about a little while ago?\nExplain properly!

ID=260086007
......

ID=260086008
Recently, the reason why I can not go to Dave Town,\nThat monk 's monster all got to eat everyone in the town.

ID=260086009
Doing things ... I guess I ate the soul of a person who died in that town anymore! What?

ID=260086010
Then, the soul of Mrs. Dad and Mother may be in that point.

ID=260086011
If so, ...\nIf you defeat that key point monster, your soul may return ... maybe you will be alive again ...?

ID=260086012
You ... you seriously think?

ID=260086013
Are you serious, are not you!\nNeither Dady nor Mum ... I am sure I was worried about my thing, I've been there all the time!

ID=260086014
He should have been watching me all the time. But, a key point is emerging ...!\nBesides, the uncle of the Star Forest Union was saying!\nIf you defeat the key point monster, everyone will be saved!

You killed him? Dad and Mum?

ID=600860202
(I toppled down to Ted, but everyone told me they did not come back to life)

ID=600860203
That 's right! That's right.\nA deceased person will not come back to life ... even such a matter of course ....

ID=600860204
Both my dad and Mom are dead ....\nI will not be in this world any longer!

ID=560086002
Dad and Mother died ... It is not a black tunnel that appears recently, it is not caused by a monster.\nPeople in black clothes ... I killed my dad and mum.

ID=560086003
I am afraid .... I was hiding with a bat.\nI believed that Dad ... I bet he will knock down those black dresses.

ID=560086004
... Dad, if I could not win by myself ... I knew it would be dead ....\nEven though I fought together.

ID=560086005
When my dad was not there, Mother promised me that he would protect me ....\nI could not keep that promise ....

ID=560086006

%username%. I heard the story.

ID=260086502
In Dave Town ... There was something bad, did not it?

ID=260086503
I do not know the details ... From those I met in Dave Town,\nI heard some story that I heard that I can not contact my family.

ID=260086504
It was because of his poor complexion of%username%, was not it?

ID=260086505
......

ID=260086506
%username%. I have no power ....\nBut at the very least I would like to pray for the victims.

ID=260086507
If you do not mind, could you bring me the victim's belongings or something?

ID=660086501
Thank you very much.

ID=660086502
be careful.

ID=360086501
Please bring the victim's belongings or something from Dave Town.\nPlease.

ID=560086501
Welcome back. Thank you for your good work.

ID=560086502
(I handed "the relics of residents" to Kautcha)

ID=560086503
I understand the pain of touching someone's death and bringing that relic ... ...\nThank you for listening to such a request ... Thank you.

ID=560086504
May this prayer ... comfort a little bit of the soul of the victim ....

ID=560086505
Are you pretending to be a good person again?

ID=560086506
...! What?

ID=560086507
Everything that was sacrificed is due to Vesi ....\nDo you even think that you are entitled to pray for you?

ID=560086508
Julie ....

ID=560086509
I think that victims do not want you to only pray.

ID=560086510
A person who loves Vesi prays for themselves who were killed by Vesi ....\nEven though I just thought about it, I could get a bite.

ID=560086511
......

ID=560086512
If you want to pray so much,\nPlease do it after burning all photos of the Vesi in the room.\nI will admit it if I can do it.

ID=560086513
......

ID=560086514
Is it impossible? I know.\nSo, please do not imitate such a thing now.

ID=560086515
I feel sick.

ID=560086516
(Julie came home with an angry heart)

ID=560086517
......

ID=560086518
Oh, I'm sorry ....\nI'll think again ....

ID=560086519
Kyo ... Thank you very much for today.

ID=460086501
Excuse me ....

ID=260087001
Hello. It is the first time since I came to Grace City.\nTo speak to%username% is.

ID=260087002
I heard that there were various kinds.\nI do not think we have to talk about it again.

ID=260087003
Oh, actually it is, there is something I want you to check one.

ID=260087004
You may be familiar with ... There is a strange rumor in Grace City here.

ID=260087005
It is an urban legend called "a person without face"\nIt is a ghost story that when walking in the street alone alone ... appears from anywhere and is choked.

ID=260087006
And it is not only that strange ... that figure!

ID=260087007
It is a black suit and human beings are so tall and slender that they can not think,\nAnd there is no face. Therefore it is called "a person without a face" ....

ID=260087008
When I heard this story for the first time, I thought that it was just a city legend but I was not interested.

ID=260087009
Yesterday ... I saw it ....

ID=260087010
Oh, of course, I did not see it directly, but the camera we installed near Dave Town ....\nDo you know? It was reflected in it.

ID=260087011
I doubt my eyes ....\nNo way it is truly witnessing the city legend ....

ID=260087012
That's what I want you to check with that ... Is that it? To which?

ID=260087013
No way, there is nothing to be afraid of the hero of Kandas city?

ID=260087014
Whether you believe it or not will depend on you!\nBut ... do you still want to check it?

ID=660087001
That's right. There is only a call called a hero in Kandas city.\nThe place I witnessed with the camera was in the back of Dave Town.

ID=660087002
Please reveal the truth of the urban legend ... Oh, please come home safely, do not you think?

ID=360087001
......

ID=360087002
... ... Yes, I understand that I am afraid.

ID=360087003
But I believe. Thank you!

ID=560087001
It is safe and above all.

ID=560087002
What kind of guy was it?\nAgain as the city legend ...?

ID=560087003
Huh? Rapid Flame's Vechi ...?

ID=560087004
... I see. It was nice to have reached the truth that it is not an urban legend ....\nIt is somewhat skittish.

ID=560087005
However, thank you very much for your direct confirmation.

ID=460087001
Hmm, what kind of city legend is next ....\nWow! Well, have you come yet! What?

ID=260087501
I was waiting,%username%.

ID=260087502
I heard that one case in Dave Town was serious.\nThen ... Is Scar emerge again ...?

ID=260087503
I have something I would like to ask of that and I will contact you.

ID=260087504
May I have a little time?

ID=260087505
Do you remember earlier that Julie told me "a woman who loved Vesi"?

ID=260087506
That is ... a fact.\nI loved him, ... a man who is a Vesi. No, I still love you.

ID=260087507
Oh, the reaction like%username% is the first time. Huff.

ID=260087508
It is natural to be surprised, but it is the first time I did not say anything.

ID=260087509
Everyone initially thinks it was a joke or a prank,\nWhen you know that you are serious, you start to reveal hatred and anger from that moment.

ID=260087510
So,%username% 's response ... I'm kind of happy.

ID=260087511
%username%.\nI do not regret having loved him no matter what you think or whatever you say.

ID=260087512
Of course, I can understand Julie's feelings ....

ID=260087513
But, if I apologize to her ... ....\nHe who loves me and I love him ... is really a monster ....

ID=260087514
For him who abandoned everything and loved me ....\nI also decided to discard everything and to love him.

ID=260087515
As you can imagine, he is no longer in this world.

ID=260087516
Rapid Flame seeks more strength than love.\nHe responded to the battle ordered from the executive.

ID=260087517
He made me admit that I love human beings ....\nThe other party is to erase the shamed family who loves human beings ....

ID=260087518
Executive of Rapid Flame "Scar".\nHe lost his battle with Scar and was killed.

ID=260087519
please do not worry.\nFrom the time I loved him ... I was prepared.

ID=260087520
Besides, this is related to what you wanted to do this time.\nThen, the continuation of the story ....

ID=260087521
There seems to be such a legend between Rapid Flame who worships strength.\n"The soul of the loser who has died in the battle will live in the weapon of the winner."

ID=260087522
... Huhu. You already have a guess, right?

ID=260087523
That's right. I want you to bring Scar's weapon where his soul lived.\nThat huge ax ....

ID=260087524
I am well aware that it is a selfish and unpleasant wish.

ID=260087525
But ... I do not want to see a weapon that his soul lived hurt people.\nHow about ... Please.

ID=660087501
Do you listen?

ID=660087502
thank you very much.

ID=360087501
Please bring the weapon of "Scar" that appeared in Dave Town.\nBefore the weapon that his soul lives has hurt any more ...!

ID=560087501
This ... is this ...?

ID=560087502
(I placed Scar's ax in front of Katja)

ID=560087503
Somehow ... it's painful.\nI could not believe that the soul is dwelling in weapons, but ... when I actually see it ....

ID=560087504
I can not even go to heaven, the pain that keeps being captured in this ... how much is it?

ID=560087505
......

ID=560087506
please do not worry.\nIf it does not cry in this much, even if I miss you ... I promised him to not follow.

ID=560087507
From the moment when I have crossed the fence of Vesi and man and love each other, be prepared for it ....

ID=560087508
It is a lie, is not it? Kacha - san ... Ve, you, Ah, oh, oh, I love you ....

ID=560087509
...! What?

ID=560087510
That ... that kind of ...! Is it a mistake, is not it?

ID=560087511
No, it is true.\nI was in love with a man who was a Vesi.

ID=560087512
Why, why .... Wow ... Sorry. I am with this ...!

ID=560087513
(Allen ran for it with a pale blue face)

ID=560087514
......

ID=560087515
Huhuu, I will be fine.\nBecause I am already used to this kind of thing.

ID=560087516
More than that, I'm worried about Mr. Allen.\nBecause it is a pure person ... I wonder if the shock was great.

ID=560087517
%username%.\nThank you very much today.

ID=560087518
Listen to complicated wishes comfortably ....

ID=460087501
see you.

ID=260089001
Hey! Are you free now? Help me if I am free!

ID=260089002
A troublesome man appeared in the external development area where the crewmembers left.

ID=260089003
Say the code name "press". It's a heavy bay using a scythe, but this is surprisingly a lie.\nYou have to beat down to the busy ....

ID=260089004
Why are you explaining so much about it? Mr. Maxim?\nI wish I could say it as usual.

ID=260089005
Hey, run! Want to spoil the mood!

ID=260089006
No, do you need mood?\nWell Maxim is left alone ... Actually, I am in a state where I can not sortie right away now while waiting for backward support.

ID=260089007
So why can not you beat that press on the press instead?\nHe seems to be a natural enemy of our tank.

ID=260089008
run! You do not explain everything!\nWell ... well all the runs have been said, supplementary one ... he is suge fat!

ID=260089009
But the arm is certain! Do not look sweet with a fat guy?\nDo you know why Eagle can work until this year?

ID=260089010
All is thanks to this belly! Gahahaha.\nThat's why ....

ID=260089011
Yes yes yes, it will be this pattern every time.\nYou should not even ask Maksim everything you say! Because I will be in a state.

ID=260089012
I have to throw it at the time like this.

ID=260089013
Hey hey! What is it! Let me shed it! !

ID=260089014
Well, take care! Thanks ~.

ID=660089001
You must be careful!\nHey ranch! Recently I respected eagle ...!

ID=660089002
It is not from the original.

ID=360089001
(I do not want to get involved any more)

ID=360089002
(Defeat "press" that you are in the external development area quickly)

ID=560089001
Have you pressed down?

ID=560089002
Sorry! With this, I can wait backward with confidence.

ID=560089003
By the way ... How was he like?\nAfter all, with the power of the belly ....

ID=560089004
Good job.\nWell ... one more job ....

ID=560089005
run! The treatment of eagle has become sloppy recently! What?

ID=560089006
What? Is that so?\nOh, that's right.

ID=560089007
You recently missioned with Roy?

ID=560089008
Is that ... Roy How are you?

ID=560089009
Well, that was good.

ID=560089010
It is unusual for a run to hear about Roy?\nSo recently, you do not see where you are hanging ....

ID=560089011
I have not seen you recently.\nWell, I wish I was fine. Roy is also busy ....

ID=560089012
Well, the combat troops are involved in an emergency call.\nBut are you a childhood friend? You can go and see me when this work is done.

ID=560089013
Yeah yeah, I understand.\nMaxim working with the power of stomach.

ID=560089015
Gahahaha! Stomach like!

ID=460089001
So, why do not you go on a diet?

ID=460089002
Become

ID=460089003
Hydrofuff.\nOh, can you ask me another job?

ID=460089004
Please come and visit me if you are ready.

ID=260089501
Ah, came and came. Sorry ~.\nEven you are busy.

ID=260089502
I do not want to ask Mr. Maxim a bit.

ID=260089503
Actually, it seems that there are still people who use chains like "press".\nThat name is the codenamed "Big Butcher".

ID=260089504
I also heard that the appearance is similar to the press and also uses a chain.\nBut, this mission is not a simple suppression.

ID=260089505
It is necessary for a certain strategy!\nThat's ... Neither invite people "Use strategy with enemies"!

ID=260089506
If you use that chain, it seems that you can raise the strength of the tank in the ST lab!\nUpgrade the tank with enemy things!

ID=260089507
A good strategy right? Can you do it?

ID=660089501
Oh, is it secret to Maxim?\nBecause that person is worrying.

ID=660089502
Well, thank you.

ID=360089501
Collect the "heavy steel chain" from the code name "Big Butcher".\nThanks ~.

ID=560089501
Have you gathered already?\nHey ~! Work is quick!

ID=560089502
(I handed "a thick iron chain" to the run)

ID=560089503
Thank you ~.\nMr. Maxim has not noticed it, is it?

ID=560089504
What is an eaga?

ID=560089505
Wow! Please do not come out suddenly from behind!\nI was about to throw away! What?

ID=560089506
What? You too well came out a lot.\nYou do not have to be so surprised.

ID=560089507
Haa ... let's assume that it was done without throwing away.

ID=560089508
That's true ... well!\nIt was also possible to get on your pace.

ID=560089509
Does not it ... damn?

ID=560089510
Do not stare off the eagle, do you? Gahaha!\nSo what are you hiding?

ID=560089511
Oh ... a bit of personal things ....\nWell, I have nothing to do with Mr. Maxim ....

ID=560089512
Relationship with Eagle ... I have a bad feeling. Did you steal a mine?

ID=560089513
Naming "A huge diet strategy with hamster wheels!"\nTying Maxim with a heavy iron chain, connecting the "Beast Fang" caught in front of it,\nTo keep running continuously forever ....

ID=560089514
You idiot! It is not sanity!\nI will not do it! !

ID=560089515
(Maxim ran with a pale face)

ID=560089516
Fuu, dangerous danger ....

ID=560089517
Huhu, you are also absent.\nThank you for collecting it.

ID=560089518
Oh, then Roy ....

ID=560089519
Roy, please ... Please.\nWow. Somewhat shameful this.

ID=460089501
Roy is a secret! What?\nSee ya!

ID=260090001
Oh, I was waiting.

ID=260090002
I have a duty to leave it to you.

ID=260090003
You will know that the assassination unit of Rapid Flame has appeared in the external development area.\nIt has already been put into operation.

ID=260090004
Fuu ... But I can not win the age as well.\nI never thought that such an old body was so frustrating ....

ID=260090005
Even though everyone is battling life and fighting ....\nI am in such a place ....

ID=260090006
......

ID=260090007
But, now that I jumped into the battlefield without thinking,\nIt just pushes the companion into a more dangerous situation.

ID=260090008
Now I have no choice but to do what I can do on this occasion.

ID=260090009
Perhaps it is to make the appropriate order to you.

ID=260090010
Also the story has gone long.\nLet's tell you the matter.

ID=260090011
Most assassination units that appeared in external development areas,\nDo you know that it consists of codenamed "Wild Beak" and "Python"?

ID=260090012
As expected, there are only people who know the site.

ID=260090013
It seems that there are a lot of numbers and it is struggling to be pinched by a pinch ....\nSo there is one suggestion, leave the wild beak in the air to the crew.

ID=260090014
I want you to reduce the number of Python.

ID=660090001
Hurry up.\nIn this way, it will suffer a big pain.

ID=660090002
I'm begging you.

ID=360090001
Order the extermination of the codoname "Python" of the assassination unit that appeared in the external development area.\nI'm begging you.

ID=560090001
I have heard the report.\nIt was a pain.

ID=460090001
Would not it be nice to be asked one more thing?

ID=260090501
Oh,%username% san .... Hello.

ID=260090502
......

ID=260090503
Ha ha!\nI have%username%, but ... I guess ....

ID=260090504
Huh? Is it a problem?\nHuh ... that is ....

ID=260090505
Actually ... Captain Senior is busy, so I checked the battlefield,\nI decided to prepare a notice to send to my family.

ID=260090506
but ....

ID=260090507
How can I accept this death ... I do not know.

ID=260090508
So, if you thought that the battle was your own family ....\nSomehow ... it got hotter ....

ID=260090509
I heard that Emilito and Jeremy were also put into the operation this time ....\nI ... with care.

ID=260090510
That's right.\nLetters later, from the other things ....

ID=260090511
(When I thought that Sora was moving about severely, suddenly I began to panic)

ID=260090512
Oh ... that?\nThere ... no where! !

ID=260090513
... I do not see any ID tags ....\nThat should be ....

ID=260090514
When sending a war death notice, I will also send the belongings of the war dead and the ID tag.\nMy belongings are good because they are in the residence.

ID=260090515
ID tags have to go directly to the work site and pick them up.

ID=260090516
This way, I can not get in this way.\nI have to go look up now.

ID=260090517
(Sora's hand is trembling, his face looks pale)

ID=260090518
Huh? Is%username% sending you in return?\nNo way ... I'm busy ....

ID=260090519
But I will be willing to speech ... ....\nFor those who need an ID tag, there are six in all.

ID=260090520
Jaydon Emmanuel, Corporal Carl, Corporal Simon, Superior Berdy, Corporal Lenny, Lieutenant Skylie ....\nThere are more than six people.

ID=260090521
Ok, thank you. Oh,%username% san ....

ID=260090522
Please also return%username% safely.

ID=360090501
There must be a corpse of the crew members in the vicinity of the building in the external development area.\nPlease pick up the ID tag from the dead body. Please.

ID=560090501
......

ID=560090502
You returned safely!\nThank you for your good work!

ID=560090503
(I passed an ID tag to Sora)

ID=560090504
Thank you very much. With this ... all the ID tags gathered.\nI just write a notice ....

ID=560090505
......

ID=560090506
%username%.\nI ... I want to send the notice to the bereaved families already.

ID=560090507
But now it is in war ... is impossible, is not it?

ID=560090508
While I was out while%username% ... I thought a lot.\nIf ... if my precious person is gone ....

ID=560090509
I ... can you accept that reality ...?\nCan you forgive someone who robbed an important person's life ...?

ID=560090510
......

ID=560090511
Hatred ... only hatred ....\nEven if I know it in the head ... the heart can not be divisible so easily, is not it?

ID=560090512
Ha ha! Sorry,%username%!\nIt became negative ... ....

ID=560090513
please do not worry!\nIf you read manga, you will soon be fine! Tehe.

ID=460090501
Well then, I will do with this.

ID=260091001
A quick news came in a while ago.\nThe code name "White Fang" appeared in the external development area.

ID=260091002
This is an executive of assassination units that appeared in external development areas.\nIt seems to have a book called "assassination force trouble creed" in which the strength of the unit is recorded.

ID=260091003
It is information gained by a lot of sacrifice.\nIt is worth verifying.

ID=260091004
Not to waste the fellow 's death ....

ID=260091005
Oops ... I got soaked in sentiment again.\nGood luck ....

ID=260091006
If he really had that book,\nThis is a great opportunity.

ID=260091007
It is possible to grasp the movement of assassination unit of Rapid Flame,\nWe can make a reasonable strategy accordingly.

ID=260091008
Then, I will give missions.\nFetching the "assassination unit trouble creed" from the executive of the assassination unit "White Fang."

ID=660091001
Do not let your guard down.

ID=360091001
It comes from the assassination unit 's executive "White Fang" and "assassination force trouble creed".\nThis is a great opportunity for us.

ID=560091001
It was a hard time.\nDid you have a book?

ID=560091002
(I handed "assassination unit trouble creed" to hype)

ID=560091003
This is the 'assassination unit trouble creed creed' ....

ID=560091004
Hmm, it looks like it will take some time to decrypt ....\nIt is possible to talk with Vesi, but the characters seem to be different ....

ID=560091005
But for those who were sacrificed, we can not give up here!\nAs long as you continue your research, there will be days when you can decipher it someday.

ID=460091001
Keep this until that time.\nIt was a pain.

ID=260091501
Long time no see

ID=260091502
Mentor, I was fine! What?

ID=260091503
I'm fine! Hehe.\nOh, that's right.

ID=260091504
Ok, I decided to train to become a hero!

ID=260091505
By the way ... Why do manga heroes have something exclusive for themselves?\nFor example ... Masky? Like a sword?

ID=260091506
But I have not even one of those ... I do not feel motivated.

ID=260091507
Well, when I went to play at the headquarters of Star Forest,\nI saw a person with a white mask like a hero on paper.

ID=260091508
I did not want that mask.\nI thought it was kind of cool ~.

ID=260091509
That mask was cool. (Flashing)\nIf there is such a thing, I may be motivated enough. (Flashing)

ID=260091510
Haa ... I guess it is impossible for wimps like Ole. (Flashing)

ID=260091511
(......)

ID=660091501
Huh? Will you pick me up?

ID=660091502
Yay! I will be a good disciple not forgetting my original intention!\nMy eyes who chose the teacher did not go crazy!

ID=660091503
To Heba! Well, I'm waiting ~!

ID=360091501
I wonder if the person wearing that white mask will let me have another mask.

ID=560091501
Welcome back!

ID=560091502
The mask! What? gave! What?

ID=560091503
(I handed White Fang's "white mask" to Ted)

ID=560091504
Uwh ... Oh crapy super cool ....\nI wanted something like this! Good morning!

ID=560091505
Wow ~ ~! ! Master!\nThank you very much!

ID=560091506
Yup? What else do you want?\nHuh ... can I say that?

ID=460091501
Then, only one more ... OK?

ID=260092001
Oh, my master! It was good.\nBecause I will go to ask other things I want.

ID=260092002
So, what do you want?

ID=260092003
To tell the truth, along with the photographs of the white masks, people with a red sword were also reflected.\nThat red sword!

ID=260092004
I went to the red sword man,\nOr will you give me a favor?

ID=660092001
Thanks dear! Master! Hehe.

ID=660092002
Take care!\nI am waiting quietly ~!

ID=360092001
He is like a ninja with a red sword.\nI want that red sword.

ID=560092001
Uwa ~! Thank you! Master!

ID=560092002
(He gave Dancing shadow's "Dancing Sword" to Ted)

ID=560092003
Oh, Ted. What was that?

ID=560092004
Oh, older sister! Look look! My teacher gave me a sword of heroes.\nIs not it cool? I will not give it to you ~.

ID=560092005
Huhu. It was good.\nThank you very much,%username%.

ID=560092006
But it was good people.\nYou can tell me if your teacher gives me ~.

ID=560092007
Huh? Is not he the one who gave me this?

ID=560092008
Vesi? what is that?

ID=560092009
......

ID=560092010
(......)

ID=560092011
Well, anyone is good! To Hehe.\nAnyway, this sword bracelet ....

ID=560092012
Did not you mention Vesi now?

ID=560092013
Your I said, is there any complaint?

ID=560092014
Please throw it away.\nThrow such a thing right now!

ID=560092015
Julie ....

ID=560092016
I would not want! Even though my teacher gave me a big prize.

ID=560092017
You ... do not think Vesi anything?\nYou thought ... I thought you were the same as me ...!

ID=560092018
Huff. That's right. I can not be the same as myself.\nBecause ... I am not an orphan!

ID=560092019
Ah! What?

ID=560092020
...! !

ID=560092021
Did not you hear it? I said that it is different from you!\nI'm not an orphan, my parents are living properly! Unlike you!

ID=560092022
This bad kid: ...! Try it once more!

ID=560092023
I will say it over and over! This orphan!\nWhat is wrong with saying to an orphan an orphan!

ID=560092024
You settled down a little. Is not it?

ID=560092025
What do you mean between me and you?\nYou are neither Mama nor Dad with him!

ID=560092026
Ted!

ID=560092027
You are wrong! Daddy ... I am busy now.

ID=560092028
Let's do it! You already know, do not you?\nDaddy 's father will not pick me up! You are already dead!

ID=560092029
Noisy noisy! !\nDaddy ... Dad is absolutely alive!

ID=560092030
Kacha's sister was saying that!\nYour father is already dead ....

ID=560092031
I do not believe what that woman says!

ID=560092032
......

ID=560092033
You're awesome!

ID=560092034
Noisy! !

ID=560092035
I am afraid of the robbery who killed my parents, because of a coward who could not do anything!\nHow about feeling that one person survived hiding?\nFunutsu. I do not believe what you say like a coward!

ID=560092036
...! What?

ID=560092037
...! !

ID=560092038
Are you a hero? Can you not make me laugh?\nA coward who killed his parents can become a hero ...!

ID=560092039
(Katja hit Julie's cheek)

ID=560092040
It is because I am painful ... It will not be a good thing to hurt others.\nApologize to Ted.

ID=560092041
Apologize to Julie, too, of Ted.

ID=560092042
... sorry. I am overwhelmed ....

ID=560092043
I will not apologize! definitely! This liar! Hypocrite!\nI do not believe anyone anymore ...! Dad is alive ... I do not die!

ID=560092044
(Julie ran away and went away)

ID=560092045
Julie! !

ID=560092046
......

ID=560092047
I'm sorry ... I'm ashamed.

ID=560092048
......

ID=460092001
I'm really sorry.

ID=260092501
I was waiting. %username%.

ID=260092502
No wonder the same thing happened again.

ID=260092503
As you probably know, I will explain it for the time being.\nYou already know that we are installing cameras on the battlefield, right?

ID=260092504
Actually, many cameras have been destroyed recently.

ID=260092505
When setting the camera in the vicinity of the external development area, the place got bald,\nThis time I thoroughly hid it ... but it was still broke.

ID=260092506
However, the culprit was reflected in the camera.\nIt is a code name "Big Butcher".

ID=260092507
I brought it in a place that I could not reach.\nEven so, I will drop it to the ground and destroy it.

ID=260092508
Please.\nPlease exterminate Big Butcher before all the installed cameras are destroyed.

ID=660092501
Thank you very much.\nBig Butcher appeared in the Gracecity external development area.

ID=660092502
Please, please stop them.

ID=660092503
Yes ... this time as well.\nWhy is only fat enemies sensitive to cameras ...? It is very interesting.

ID=360092501
Big Butcher appeared in Grace City External Development Area.\nPlease go over there.

ID=560092501
Did the Big Butcher crush?

ID=560092502
Great.\nThanks to that, I was able to suppress the damage more than last time. Thank you very much.

ID=460092501
Oh, that's right. Recently the funny shadows are appearing in the camera one by one ....

ID=460092502
A red shadow passes through the camera at a very high speed.\nI attempted slow playback, but it was not able to capture by the processing speed of the camera.

ID=460092503
The identity is unknown, but I know that it is dangerous ....\nPlease be careful enough. %username%.

ID=260093001
......

ID=260093002
(I cleared my throat because Hype did not notice)

ID=260093003
Hmm? Oh, you! How ... Ha ha ha.\nI called it.

ID=260093004
Is there something wrong?\nThis is the situation. There will be few people who do not suffer.

ID=260093005
Hey, do not worry about it.\nIt is my job to worry too.

ID=260093006
Goong! Let's say I will tell you the matter without a long talk.

ID=260093007
Have you ever seen a Vesi carrying a coffin on the battlefield?

ID=260093008
Hmm, did you also see "Hell collector"?

ID=260093009
Apparently it seems that an individual different from that helper collector appeared in the external development area.\nNow, the crew is struggling for armed forces.

ID=260093010
According to a report by members who engaged with the helicopter,\nIt is said that a member who was caught by the helmet collector was sucked into the cannon of the left arm and disappeared.

ID=260093011
Apparently, it seems to have the ability of Tempest.

ID=260093012
Fuu ....

ID=260093013
If we expand the ability of Tempest in this way,\nI decided that it would be impossible to recover.

ID=260093014
Currently the ST lab is diligently studying while sleeping,\nIt seems there is one problem.

ID=260093015
The mechanism of absorbing human soul was grasp to a certain extent as one item of Tempest,\nThere is no device to store soul energy.

ID=260093016
So I want you to pick up the coffin on which the helpless collector is carrying.

ID=260093017
Although it is uncertain information,\nIt seems that there is a possibility that the helper collector is accumulating soul energy in its coffin.

ID=260093018
If that is the case, if it gets it,\nEnergy conversion and storage method can be grasped and countermeasures can be made.

ID=660093001
If measures can be taken, we can not sacrifice any more ....\nWill you take over?

ID=660093002
You will never take care of yourself too.

ID=360093001
I want you to pick up the coffin on which the helpless collector is carrying.\nSuccessfully, you can avoid sacrificing any more.

ID=560093001
Did you go back? The coffin of the helmet collector?

ID=560093002
It was a hard time. Let me pass this to the ST lab.

ID=560093003
I will be exhausted with both mind and body, surrounding many battlefields ....\nSorry about that.

ID=460093001
Please take a good rest.

ID=260093501
Oh, come on.

ID=260093502
It seems healthy and has anything else. Gahaha!

ID=260093503
Oh well, your body is tough, it's hard to spirit a lot?\nWell, I guess you thought that the eagle was odd?

ID=260093504
That's ... It's bad, could you just listen to me for a moment?

ID=260093505
Oh ... well you are a good guy! Thanks!

ID=260093506
Many of my friends passed away this time.\nOf course, some of the eagles' troops are also ....

ID=260093507
......

ID=260093508
I got accustomed to war ... I am not used to the spicy to lose my friends.\nThey are the ones who have been sharing pleasure until now ....

ID=260093509
Beyond those dead corners, it is necessary to go ahead ... It's a lot of pressure.

ID=260093510
Oops ... I got so damn seriously.\nI guess this is nothing to show to the people below.

ID=260093511
Well, this is just the old age, I do not know what to do.

ID=260093512
But when I talk to you I got a little easier.\nIn addition ... There are others who would like to listen to one more story ... is it good?

ID=260093513
That other person is ... a run.\nThat guy ... It seems I got tied up for something.

ID=260093514
Do not tell me anything.\nYou are old and close, I think I will tell you something.

ID=260093515
Can you ask?

ID=660093501
Sorry.

ID=360093501
Listen to the story of the run guy.\nIf you are older, I think that I will tell you something.

ID=600935101
......

ID=600935102
I'm sorry, but now I am leaving alone.

ID=600935103
See you next time.

ID=560093501
Did you talk?

ID=560093502
... Really. Was it even impossible for you ....\nThat's quite serious.

ID=560093503
Apparently, it seems like I got back to the run when I came here for the first time.

ID=560093504
That's right ... I should speak from the beginning ....\nDo you know that the run does not come from this city?

ID=560093505
Look at your early days. The run came from the outside together with Roy of the fighting unit.\nIt is a flower who speaks well.

ID=560093506
Unlike Roy who uses different abilities while smiling,\nIt is unfriendly and vigilant. It became a hot topic soon.

ID=560093507
Do you know that the orchid can do tank maintenance?\nInitially I was assigned to an army of Eagles, I was burned a lot.

ID=560093508
Just a little closer, I will be thrown away. Gahaha.\nEveryone was holding a head?

ID=560093509
But, time solved it.\nWhile learning the compassion and ties of others little by little, the run solved the caution.

ID=560093510
The depth of the bond of Heavy Gears can not lose to any unit. It boasts of Eagle.

ID=560093511
The run also lost the friendly nature. Gahaha.\nAfter that, you also feel like my companions as you know ... No, I became a person who loves my friends like my family.

ID=560093512
Thanks to that, the personality has become brighter and wild. Gahaha.

ID=560093513
......

ID=560093514
It is the first time for a run ... It is that a lot of troops of the unit are gone.\nWell ... it was quite a shock.

ID=560093515
I wonder if the run does not laugh like the old days ... this time.\nEagle seems to have experienced someone lost some time ago.

ID=560093516
......

ID=560093517
sorry! I got a serious story. Gahaha.\nYou mean I'm feeling painful.

ID=560093518
Hey,%username%.

ID=560093519
This time ... I do not think you are responsible for myself.

ID=560093520
Whatever you may say, you did your best.\nI can not deny it to anyone.

ID=560093521
Some people may hit you with grief that lost their friends, anger that could not be defended,\nI do not care like that. Because it is just a hatchet.

ID=560093525
Without you, more lives were lost.\nLet's have lots of saved lives ... do not forget.

ID=560093526
Thank you for protecting my company.

ID=560093527
The stronger the soul worker, the harder you can get power.

ID=560093528
Go ahead and do it before you go.

ID=560093529
Well ... I do not even mention things to patterns.\nMy body is getting crazy! Here ... Go home soon!

ID=460093501
See you!

ID=260094001
Okay!\nThat ... I'm sorry about this.

ID=260094002
Is it okay? Huff. Ah well.

ID=260094003
Because I was thinking for a moment.\nDo not worry so much.

ID=260094004
Huh? Max Max was worried?\nWell, that's worrying.

ID=260094005
......

ID=260094006
I wonder if I will come back when I came here again ....\nYou were worried about it, were not you?

ID=260094007
I am fine. I ... I just remembered the old days.

ID=260094008
I do not care you even.\nDid you seem so serious?

ID=260094009
Is not that it? Ahaha. You are really kind.\nDoing so gentle to everyone, what do you do when you are betrayed?

ID=260094010
... I am.\nI do not want to do anything, I do not want to be able to do just keep silent.

ID=260094011
Be helpless, realize your own weakness,\nIt's as good as dead that such thing as just waiting for someone to help me ....

ID=260094012
This time also so.\nI could not do anything ... I killed my friends.

ID=260094013
Betrayed by someone I believed ....\nAlso someone ....

ID=260094014
If you take revenge on a traitor ....\nThis feeling ... I wonder if it will be somewhat clear ...?

ID=260094015
I killed a friend ... Even though a "phantom" that looked like a guy appeared in an external development area again.\nIt is a wait command at such a time!

ID=260094016
I am really helpless ....\nHuh

ID=260094017
sorry. After all, leave me soft for the time being.\nSee ya.

ID=260094018
(Rang said so, left to the maintenance center)

ID=660094019
(In order to comfort the run, defeat the phantom that appeared again and bring home the loot)

ID=360094001
(In order to comfort the run, defeat the phantom that appeared again and bring home the loot)

ID=560094001
Did not I tell you to be alone for the time being?\n... What did you do with such a serious face?

ID=560094002
(I handed the phantom "broken crimson blade" to the run)

ID=560094003
this is ....\nOf that Vesi?

ID=560094004
Ha ... ha ha.

ID=560094005
....\nAnyway, thanks.

ID=560094006
You remembered what you said you wanted revenge.

ID=560094007
Is this revenge ...?

ID=560094008
Ahaha. It does not change anything.\nWherever I revenge, my colleagues will not come alive ....

ID=560094009
It is hot and sad.

ID=560094010
After all it was the hardest thing for me ....

ID=560094011
......

ID=560094012
Thank you.

ID=560094013
But let me put it a bit more.\nI will return to the original me soon.

ID=560094014
Please tell Mr. Maxim as well.

ID=460094001
Please.

ID=260094501
%username%! I heard.\nNed company ... Is it true that betrayed the Star Forest Alliance?

ID=260094502
Notification of all the members of the merchant association has arrived.\nIts contents ....

ID=260094503
The Ned Company that had previously concluded support and partnership\nBetraying mankind ... Because we are doing a vicious act of cooperating with Vesi,\nAll contracts and relationships with previous Ned Company shall be canceled.

ID=260094504
... apparently.\nSomehow ... I feel that hardships will occur.

ID=260094505
Actually, the merchant association secretly signed a trading agreement with the Ned Company and weapons,\nMost of the missiles now used by Ned Company seems to have been provided by a merchant association ....

ID=260094506
Naturally, as Ned Company betrayed humanity, there is absolutely no provision of weapons.\nAlso, we will provide missiles at half price to the Star Forest Alliance for one year. ... It's half price?

ID=260094507
So, although the request has come to let you see some of the items from the Star Forest Alliance ....\nI do not have weapons so much so I do not have them ....

ID=260094508
I am sorry but ....\nWill you bring a missile provided to the Ned Company?

ID=660094501
Thank you!

ID=660094502
Most of the missiles seem to be mounted on machines called tripods,\nIf you destroy the tripod, you should get it.

ID=360094501
But why will Ned Company betray the Star Forest Alliance?\nUntil we turned this much to enemies.

ID=360094502
What kind of profit is on siding with Vesi .... I can not understand it at all.

ID=560094501
Oh, it's a missile. Thank you very much.

ID=560094502
I will tell the Star Forest Alliance to come and get it,\nPlease leave it here.

ID=460094501
Fuu ... I heard that it is war,\nI realized that such a weapon is in front of me ... the reality is more serious ....

ID=460094502
Why does mankind like this war ...?\nNot only they but also monsters like Seoul Junk ....

ID=460094503
I do not know where I am going in this war ....

ID=460094504
Thank you for your cooperation. see you.

ID=260095001
Um ...%username%.

ID=260095002
Oh, there is something I'd like to ask ....\nIs that okay?

ID=260095003
Oh, I did not say the content ....\nSorry ... Haha ....

ID=260095004
That ...%username%\nI heard that it headed for the secret base of Ned Company.

ID=260095005
According to the staff 's story, there seems to be a mercenary with power transcending human beings ....\nI am curious about that power.

ID=260095006
I'm going to investigate the blood of that mercenary.

ID=260095007
And ... somehow using that ....

ID=260095008
Oh, no! This is the story! Ha ha ...!

ID=260095009
So, if you do not mind, could you get me the mercenary blood sample?

ID=660095001
Thank you very much.\nOkay, thank you!

ID=360095001
From the mercenary at the secret base of the Ned Company,\nPlease pick up the blood sample. Please!

ID=560095001
Welcome back!\nSo ... that blood sample to me ....

ID=560095002
(I gave Sora the "Ned Mercenary Blood Sample")

ID=560095003
This is mercenary blood ....

ID=560095004
......

ID=560095005
Oh,%username%!\nThank you for stopping by.

ID=560095006
What is this used for?\nThat is ....

ID=560095007
......

ID=560095008
Well ... I will talk to%username%.

ID=560095009
Make special medicine that reacts to this blood ....\nEmilito ... The desire that puts everyone around is a revenge!

ID=560095010
... But if you dyed your hands on revenge ....\nI do not feel like returning to my current job.

ID=560095011
I use knowledge that I thought I wanted to save my life ... to take away my life ....\nIt is a good idea to overturn the ...

ID=560095012
I ... I can not be embarrassed, do you?\nSwear revenge ... asking for funny things ....

ID=560095013
Even revenge that he owed ... hesitate ....

ID=560095014
Then, shall I lend a hand?

ID=560095015
Captain Ha, Hype!\nWhy are you here ...! Oh, a regular check - up.

ID=560095016
Answer my question, Sora corporal.\nDo you want revenge?

ID=560095017
......

ID=560095018
If you can not make a decision, I will make it decisive.

ID=560095019
If you want to hear the continuation of the story, please come to me.

ID=560095020
Oh, that ... what does that mean ....

ID=560095021
Until then, I will take care of this.

ID=560095022
(Hyp took 'Ned mercenary blood sample' from Sora)

ID=560095023
Well, I'll be waiting.

ID=560095024
(Hype returned home)

ID=560095025
Uh ... I can not figure out the situation ....\nIt is better than I do.

ID=560095026
%username%. Thank you very much!\nI ... I will go to Colonel Haipu!

ID=560095027
(Sora chased after the hype)

ID=460095001
(Let's follow her as she is worried)

ID=260095501
Yo, you?\nI am a little busy right now. Please come back later.

ID=260095502
Hmm? What's wrong? I will beat the secret base of Ned from now.\nIt seems that he 's a "road buster" there is no way he can compete without being a tank.

ID=260095503
I thought about letting traitors take a sneak peek! Gahaha!

ID=260095504
By the way,\nYou seem to have something to talk about to Eagle. Try to speak briefly.

ID=260095505
(I told Maksim about the orchid)

ID=260095506
Hmm, let me think alone ...?\nI do not understand even if I bring a phantom with his sword.

ID=260095507
Gahaha! Well, I can predict what the run thinks.

ID=260095508
Then, I have to go get more and more beaten up.

ID=260095509
Hey. Please ask me one.\nPlease tell the run so that Eagle alone will go knocking on Ned.

ID=260095510
If I get the idea of ​​Eagle,\nThis should return to the usual run.

ID=260095511
Can you ask?

ID=660095501
Thanks! If it does not move even if it lets you, it only makes me feel like moving.\nWell then, I'll come over!

ID=660095502
(I got into the tank whether Maxim was serious)

ID=660095503
(Tell this to the run as soon as possible)

ID=360095501
(I got into the tank whether Maxim was serious)

ID=360095502
(Let's tell the run as soon as possible)

ID=600955101
Oh ... you are persistent, unexpectedly.\nDid you forget what I said?

ID=600955102
(I told the run about Maksim)

ID=600955103
Huh? Beat the secret base of Ned Company! What?\nSuch troops should not have such troops ....

ID=600955104
... Well, no way! Maxim alone! What?

ID=600955105
(Ran is a face with blood clutter, started to wirelessly somewhere)

ID=600955106
Maxim's! Please respond!\nGoing alone for assistance ... Is not it crazy! What?

ID=600955107
Maxim's! What? Maxim warrant!

ID=600955108
(No response from radio)

ID=600955109
Why is not it! Are you going to go over there alone? It is not decent!\n... What shall I do ... hey, what should I do ....

ID=600955110
That's it! What is Mr. Maxim's mission?

ID=600955111
Destruction of 'Load Buster'?\nIt is unreasonable! What we are asking for our troops is that we can not afford to battle troops ...!

ID=600955112
I will go there alone.\nI do not want to ... If I lose to Maxim ... I ...!

ID=600955113
Hey! you!\nLend me the power!

ID=600955114
Mr. Maxim has decided to prepare, so he will not be on the radio ....\nSo, you go and destroy the "load buster"!

ID=600955115
If I got into the tank a while ago, I have not arrived yet in the operational area!\nYou ought to get there earlier.

ID=600955116
Please! Because I can catch up soon.\nUntil then ... Protect Maxim!

ID=600955117
... Thank you.\nWell, see you later!

ID=600955301
Indeed you do not look like an enemy! Gahaha.\nI will make him raise his heavy back. Thank you.

ID=600955302
What are you saying! What?\nIf new arrival did not make it in time ... What did you plan to do? !

ID=600955303
What are you going to do?\nWell, I'm planning to visit you one day ....

ID=600955304
Even his military power at the secret base did not bring his hands or feet ...?

ID=600955305
I do not have any hands or legs? I do not understand.\nI bought a shot at one shot!

ID=600955306
Huh, that's why ....\nIt is good. It is unfortunate that you are not hurt ....

ID=600955307
Exactly. You do not have to hurt. Let it take time and effort.

ID=600955308
Yes?

ID=600955309
Nobody was injured this time this time.\nYou do not have to keep it.

ID=600955310
Maxim's ...?

ID=600955311
I do not know what you are thinking ... somehow.\nHowever, this is a war.

ID=600955312
And the warrior was a soldier who participated in his own will in the war.\nWashira belongs to the Western Federation of Star Forest Union, Weapons Operation Force "Heavy Gears".

ID=600955313
Protect citizens by putting out a deck figure.\nIt's life-threatening ....

ID=600955314
In other words, you are ready to throw a life any time to protect everyone.\nDo you understand?

ID=600955315
Whether you desperately keep it or not will not protect you, it does not matter.\nWashiras do not blame others for their death and I do not think they want someone to protect them.

ID=600955316
I do not know why you desperately try to keep it.\nBut you just know what is not a simple reason to keep a friend.

ID=600955317
Ran ... what did you do in the past and what kind of human?\nEven if there is something the Washira can not say.

ID=600955318
You are a human being and a friend of Heavy Gears.\nHeavy Gears, you do not have to be the one who blames you for not protecting you.

ID=600955319
So, do not become so serious.\nDid you understand?

ID=600955320
......

ID=600955321
Hey, hey ... was it a bit too decided?\nThe run is silent.

ID=600955322
What do you do when you are in such a situation!\nYou are a soul worker! Somehow ....

ID=600955323
Maxim ... I have said unusually good things.\nIt's time to immerse in such a time?

ID=600955324
And soul workers do not matter.\nNot at all. After all, the usual Maxim said at the end.

ID=600955325
well understood! Do not worry anymore.\nI will also face and live!

ID=600955326
Gahaha! That's it!

ID=600955327
so!

ID=600955328
so?

ID=600955329
Maxim will turn around again, let's drop the obstructive meat!\nWell, then, from now on the diet plan that I could not ever ...!

ID=600955330
You idiot! Do not know how many times you can! !

ID=600955331
(Maxim escaped away)

ID=600955332
Hmm. I got crying, I got it back.

ID=600955333
Oh, no.\nDo not talk a little?

ID=600955334
There is something I want to talk about.\nI'll be waiting.

ID=560095501
You came. Hydrofuff.\nDo you have a face that fits you?

ID=560095502
Is not it going to be a long talk?\nAhaha, that's fine. It does not matter so long.

ID=560095503
you know what ....\nActually, I was thinking in the beginning ... I'm going to be a little distance from you.

ID=560095504
But, I got along like this soon ....

ID=560095505
True, everyone here is appealing and it gets in trouble.\nI do not care but my emotions change.

ID=560095506
......

ID=560095507
The world is not as gentle as you think.\nThe more you shine, the more people aim for you.

ID=560095508
So do not forget to doubt always be alert.\nOf course, also about me.

ID=560095509
Huh ... But I was pleased that you accepted me.\nYour charm is that straightforward.

ID=560095510
%username%.

ID=560095511
Someday ... When you are driven into a dilemma,\nIf that happens.

ID=560095512
I will be your strength.

ID=560095513
So go ahead and move on with peace of mind.

ID=560095514
Thank you for care so far.

ID=460095501
I support you.

ID=260096001
Did you come also?\nJust right, I have a duty to ask you.

ID=260096002
Sora has entrusted the patient who was seriously injured by a robot that burns fire.\nI'd like to ask you to destroy that robot 'Megiddo Maker MK II'.

ID=260096003
Let me explain the circumstances.\nA robot called "Megiddo Maker MK II" appeared at the secret laboratory of Ned Company.

ID=260096004
The damage by that robot is enormous ....\nIf we do not hit the hand earlier, more damage will spread.

ID=260096005
The situation will contend for a moment. Hurry up!

ID=260096006
Umm, Colonel Hyp.

ID=260096007
What happened?

ID=260096008
Is ... that treating injured people really leads to revenge?

ID=260096009
of course. There is nothing to worry about.

ID=260096010
Is that right, is not it? I understand.

ID=660096001
Both of you hurry up.\nDo not waste a minute or a second.

ID=360096001
A robot called "Megiddo Maker MK II" appeared at the secret laboratory of Ned Company.\nThe damage caused by him is enormous. I want you to destroy as soon as possible.

ID=560096001
Did you go back?\nThe story is being heard from other members.

ID=560096002
It did a good job. I was saved.

ID=560096003
Umm, Colonel Hypo!

ID=560096004
Did Sora go back, too?

ID=560096005
Does this really lead to revenge?\nI'm just ... I'm just treating ....

ID=560096006
of course.

ID=560096007
You are revening enough for the Ned Company right now.\nThere is no worry.

ID=560096008
Well, but ...!

ID=560096009
Can not believe what I say?\nDo not worry too well for your health.

ID=560096010
Umm ... Colonel!

ID=560096011
Then, I will return to the place.\nLet's meet again.

ID=560096012
(Hype entered the building)

ID=560096013
......

ID=460096001
(Sora has also returned)

ID=260096501
......

ID=260096502
Um,%username%.

ID=260096503
After all, I think that even if I do such a thing it will not lead to revenge.\nI can not do more with such feelings.

ID=260096504
I will tell Colonel Hypo that I can not do any more.

ID=260096505
(Sora got angry and went to the hype)

ID=660096501
(Let's chase soon)

ID=360096501
(Sora got angry and went to the hype, so let's chase it soon)

ID=600965101
Colonel ... I can not understand what the colonel says!\nHow do treating injured people lead to revenge? What?

ID=600965102
To me ... I can only imagine that the colonel is teasing me.\nSo ...!

ID=600965103
Hmm ... corporal Soora. If you say that you can not accept it ....\nLet me do as you wish.

ID=600965104
(Hyp to the Sora "Ned Mercenary Blood Sample")

ID=600965105
Th-This is ....

ID=600965106
I wished for this "Ned Mercenary Blood Sample"?\nThere are two things you can do with this.

ID=600965107
One. Studying it, making a poison that reacts only to Ned mercenaries.

ID=600965108
The other is to make new medicines that can rescue in the same way and save the lives of members going to death.

ID=600965109
It is you who decide.\nWhichever you choose, respect and support your idea.

ID=600965110
How is it? Can you decide?

ID=600965111
That ... in such a sudden ...!

ID=600965112
... A little ... please give me some time to think.

ID=600965113
It will be good. Let's do this.\n%username%, Do you remember "Megiddo Maker MK II"?

ID=600965114
I got information that a robot of the same type as that robot appeared at the secret laboratory of Ned Company.\nThe name is called "Ned Fire Ruler".

ID=600965115
Members are being torn down one after another.\nYou order the destruction of him.

ID=600965116
I'd like you to meet Sora once the mission is completed.\nI will go to see Sora as soon as I receive a report from the crew.

ID=600965117
Corpora Sora. I want you to answer by that time.\nCan you do it?

ID=600965118
... Yes. I understand.

ID=600965119
Alright. Well, see you later.

ID=600965120
(Hype and Sora returned to their respective positions, let's go destroying the "Ned Fire Ruler")

ID=600965301
Well, have you come back?\nWell, such a thing ... I, yet ....

ID=600965302
Then let me hear the answer.

ID=600965303
Captain Ha, Haipu.\nMe ....

ID=600965304
I am sorry, too. I can not decide ....\nHowever, I do not think that treating an injured person will lead to revenge!

ID=600965305
Am I ... something wrong?\nColonel does not understand the meaning of such roundabout!

ID=600965306
Were not you able to lend my power to my revenge! What?\nWhy treat only injured people ...!

ID=600965307
Bother, let me suffer ....\nWhat do you want to do with me!

ID=600965308
(Sora spit out all his thoughts while excited)

ID=600965309
Hua ... huh ....\nI am sorry, too! I ... right ....

ID=600965310
Have you refreshed?\nIt seems that considerable stress was accumulating.

ID=600965311
... Huh?

ID=600965312
I was forced to choose, I was just driving you.\nI have no idea to make fun of you, much less troubling.

ID=600965313
Corpora Sora. I ordered you to treat the injured,\nThat is the way to make the best use of you.

ID=600965314
It is also the same to lower the enemy 's subjugation order to%username%.\nI do not want to say that much, but ... he is a suitable guy.

ID=600965315
But, how will my treatment and revenge connect?

ID=600965316
By continuing treatment,\nShow them the attitude that they have not lost yet.

ID=600965317
In the last strategy ... I lost a lot of my friends.\nBut that did not mean we were defeated by this war.

ID=600965318
I do not know what the real defeat is ...?

ID=600965319
That is to be tied up with fellow revenge.\nDo not forget the effort to win the war.

ID=600965320
Use a dead man as an excuse and get revenged.\nEven though they want it ...?

ID=600965321
If you do not want to make an excuse to lose as your friends died,\nYou must overcome their death and triumph over it as food.

ID=600965322
To that end, I think that it is best to play an active part in the field where I can demonstrate my best ability.

ID=600965323
You said you wanted revenge? You should do.\nBut do not imitate such as stepping out people's way.

ID=600965324
Do not lose heartily to those who killed your fellow.\nThat is respect for my friends who have left the world.

ID=600965325
If the heart fails to lose, fellow death will not be in vain.

ID=600965326
Keep it in mind.\nIt should surely lead to the victory of this long war.

ID=600965327
Did you understand a little?

ID=600965328
......

ID=600965329
I do not say that I should consent immediately.\nThis is only my opinion.

ID=600965330
The important thing is that you do not take revenge until you throw yourself away.\nIs not it?

ID=600965331
... Yes. A little bit ... but.

ID=600965332
Ha ha ha. It is straightforward and good.\nThen, I will return to the place.

ID=600965333
%username%. You should come with me.

ID=560096501
I'm sorry.

ID=560096502
Thank you for watching over emotional instability Sora.\nIf it had not been for you, she might have stepped off the road.

ID=560096503
By the way, when you first came here, it was a similar feeling.\nSuch a you became so sturdy ....

ID=560096504
I'm happy.

ID=560096505
%username%.\nWar is filled with negative emotions such as anger and hatred.

ID=560096506
It is our job to turn it into a positive emotion.\nAnd that is also the best thing.

ID=560096507
I have always let you wipe it, but please do not forget this alone.\nWe are not beaten to anyone by heart. Of course nothing to you.

ID=560096508
%username%. If you become possessed by revenge and you are about to step down the road, come at any time.

ID=560096509
That is about how adults we can do for you.

ID=560096510
Thank you for listening to my selfish request.

ID=560096511
The way to go from now will be much more steep than the way I walked.\nPlease do not lose.

ID=460096501
Well, let's meet again. It is a cheerful figure.

ID=260097001
%username%, It is serious!\nJulie ... There is no Julie anywhere!

ID=260097002
As usual ... I thought that I would come home with casual face ....\nOh, it is all my responsibility.

ID=260097003
Julie ... It is a child I came across by chance.\nI discovered that I have a doll alone in the building of the Ned Company in the external area.

ID=260097004
Julie's father died fighting Vesi to defend Julie.

ID=260097005
When I found Julie, she was in a state I did not say anything for three days.\nMy body and mind are too dumb.

ID=260097006
I thought that the body of the father was not in front of the room where the Julie was,\nI talked ... I found it in a different place.

ID=260097007
Julie was a grown-up boy, so it seemed that he accepted his father's death ....\nSince I was disappointed ... I begin to deny everything I say ....

ID=260097008
Even the fact that his father died ... I began to deny it.

ID=260097009
... It was my fault.\nAs Jurie said ... I am a hypocrite .... That 's why.

ID=260097010
Do not leave the jury alone!\nThat girl, trauma when trapped ...!\nBut how to find it ....

ID=260097011
And do not worry!\nI, I will also look for it together!

ID=260097012
Allen ....

ID=260097013
I asked my friends to investigate ....\nJulie seems to have headed to the secret base of Ned Company.

ID=260097014
But ... there is no section where ordinary people do not enter, nothing more than that ....\nHowever,%username% is supposed to do it afterwards!

ID=260097015
Is not it?

ID=260097016
Thank you very much. %username%.\nI think, I'm sure that Julie will go to a place with a father.

ID=260097017
If it is, it should have been to the laboratory inside the secret base.\nI have a map of a secret base.

ID=260097018
I will send the map to%username%\nI'd like you to search inside the laboratory for%username%! Could you please?

ID=660097001
Thank you very much. If not, there is another route ....

ID=660097002
......

ID=660097003
Teated?

ID=660097004
(Ted has gone somewhere)

ID=660097005
Allen ... Thank you so much.

ID=660097006
Well ... yet ... it is early to say thanks Mr. Kacha! First we have to find the Julie.\n%username%! Thank you!

ID=360097001
... Please.

ID=360097002
In my opinion, Julie should have headed to the laboratory inside the secret base.\nPlease search there!

ID=560097001
Julie ...! What?\nDid you have it?

ID=560097002
Was not there ...? Something like that ...!

ID=560097003
Mr. Kuracha! It is serious!

ID=560097004
Teateddy is gone!

ID=560097005
Ted: Are you also Ted?

ID=560097006
(Katja crumbled down)

ID=560097007
Are you okay, Mr. Kuracha! !

ID=560097008
It's okay.\nRather than that ... I have to find those children in a hurry ...!

ID=560097009
Oh,%username%!\nIs Julie ...?

ID=460097001
Is that so. Okay, let's increase the number of people.\nIt is necessary to search another route ....

ID=260097501
welcome! Oh? %username%!

ID=260097502
Always Good Timmin Goods! Ha ha ha!

ID=260097503
(I have a bad feeling, I try to change direction as I decided to return)

ID=260097504
Well! Wait a moment, please!\nIt's not good to listen even just the story!

ID=260097505
Various troubles in the matter of this time Ned Company!

ID=260097506
Prices have also risen, and there are many other things ....

ID=260097507
There are many inconveniences from such a situation.\nThe frustration of everyone in the town is increasing every day.

ID=260097508
Thanks to Ned Company so far it was useful in many ways,\nIt will be frustrating if that convenient life has gone away in a moment.

ID=260097509
But it is a grand no purpose ...\nIt does not mean that the betrayed Ned Company will come back ....

ID=260097510
there! I am planning to investigate the technology of Ned Company and release it.\nWill you help me for a moment?

ID=260097511
From robots that have many cutting-edge technologies,\nIf you examine the robot of Ned Company, you may find confidential technology!

ID=660097501
Well, as expected! I thought you would help me!

ID=660097502
Oh, I think that there is a droning, but will not you get that part's parts?\nA small and round ball-shaped robot!

ID=360097501
It's okay if you get some pieces of robot parts called drone!

ID=560097501
Is the example of what was available?

ID=560097502
Press! Disassemble this thoroughly and show off the technology of Ned Company!

ID=460097501
Thank you!

ID=260098001
Oh, please wait a moment.

ID=260098002
I saw a drone a bit, but it looks like a self-floating robot.

ID=260098003
Embarrassing story ... but my technology, Energy system is a bit misplaced ....

ID=260098004
I'm sorry! Um ... Is not it possible to bring another robot parts? This street!

ID=660098001
Oh, it is a generosity as expected!\nThat's why I came along with%username%!

ID=660098002
Ned Company has a biped walking robot called a punisher,\nCan not you get the parts of the robot?

ID=360098001
Would you like something to forget?\n%username%, they are all looking forward to revealing Ned Company's technology!

ID=560098001
How was the part?

ID=560098002
Oh! Supreme!\nThis is going to reveal Ned Company's technology!

ID=560098003
I will show you that I do not have to rely on the technology of Ned Company anymore! Ha ha ha!

ID=460098001
Okay, I will start working at once.\nWe look forward to the day when Ned Company's technology will be released to the whole world! Ha ha ha!

ID=260098501
Next let's try searching for the more far side.

ID=260098502
It is a place where it is impossible for children to go alone ....\nIt is worth while going.

ID=260098503
And do not worry!\nThis time there should be ...!

ID=260098504
Both of you ... Thank you.

ID=260098505
No, I have nothing!\nIt is%username% who is struggling ... / /.

ID=260098506
That's not true.\nAllen-san is there ... encouraging.

ID=260098507
Mr. Kuracha ....

ID=660098501
%username%. Please.

ID=660098502
Next time ... those children ....

ID=360098501
Julie, Ted ... Please. Being alright ....

ID=600985201
How was it?\nDid you find those children?

ID=600985202
(I told that I could not find it this time)

ID=600985203
Is that so ....

ID=600985204
Excuse me .... I can not help you this time, too ....

ID=600985205
Excuse me ....

ID=600985206
(Allen dropped a shoulder and went home)

ID=600985207
What should I do?\nSearch wish to the Star Forest Alliance ... ....

ID=600985208
Mr. Kuracha! That girl ... That girl came back!

ID=600985209
...! !

ID=600985210
(The moment when Kuracha tried to run, Ted appeared)

ID=600985211
Ted!

ID=600985212
Katya-chan ... I'm sorry. Hurry up ....\nI forgot to go say a word ....

ID=600985213
......

ID=600985214
Kacha - neechan ... Are you angry?

ID=600985215
Next time ... I will not forgive you for such a thing?\nGood?

ID=600985216
Yup. sorry.

ID=600985217
Ah ... Kacha-neechan.

ID=600985218
... Yup?

ID=600985219
Julie is looking for Kacha - neechan.\nWhen I found out, I always called my sister's name.

ID=600985220
Julie is supposed to be in the usual place.\nPlease go ahead.

ID=600985221
Before that Ted.\nHave not you seen Allen?\nI felt like I was there a while ago ....

ID=600985222
Well ....\nI have not seen it though.

ID=600985223
I understand. %username%.\nI will go to Julie.

ID=600985224
(Katja went to the place of Julie)

ID=600985225
Master!

ID=600985226
Thank you!\nI owe it to my teacher and Goodboy that I was able to help him!

ID=600985227
Electric cables the teacher came home and brought back,\nThanks to the good boy holding it, I did not get lost in the mountains.

ID=600985228
Then ... this mask and sword!\nBecause there was this, even if a monster came out it was not afraid at all!

ID=600985229
Really! Thank you!\nI got a feeling that I could become a hero!

ID=600985230
To Hehe.\nThen the master will go to Julie. I will be waiting.

ID=560098501
......

ID=560098502
......

ID=560098503
Julie ... Sorry for tapping me?\nMe ....

ID=560098504
I know. Daddy ... do not pick me up.\nDad guarding me ... what he died in front of the room ....

ID=560098505
Everything that my sister lied to me to conceal it ... everything.

ID=560098506
......

ID=560098507
My older sister who found me ... I loved you ....\nEven if my dad does not exist ... I thought she was an older sister ...! But ...!

ID=560098508
I believed it! I believed in her sister ... why did you like Vesi! What?\nwhy! What? They are dads ...!

ID=560098509
Sorry ... Sorry Julie.\nBecause of her older sister ...!

ID=560098510
But ...!

ID=560098511
I'm sorry.\nSo do not hate me about me. Older sister ....

ID=560098512
(The two hugs and cried for a while)

ID=560098513
Are they crying?

ID=560098514
Gusut ... It's too noisy! This idiot!

ID=560098515
Giggle

ID=560098516
But, I saw it for the first time ~. Kacha sister is getting angry.\nYou had better not get angry after all! I thought it was a chibi.

ID=560098517
Fool! Do not bully my sister!

ID=560098518
O, Onee! What? What's wrong?\nPlease call me like old days ~.

ID=560098519
I can not understand her sister ... I decided to believe.\nThat's it! You're annoying!

ID=560098520
Giggle That alone is sufficient. Thank you.

ID=560098521
How did you finally become adults?\nWell, does the rebellious period end?

ID=560098522
It is annoying! Go away!

ID=560098523
(Julie has gone away)

ID=560098524
Um ...%username%.\nThank you very much for your cooperation in searching for those children ... Thank you so much.

ID=460098501
That ... ... Can you lend me your power again in the end?

ID=260099001
Actually, I have a favor of Mr. Allen.

ID=260099002
It seems like this time, Allen has always been saved ....\nI would like to thank you but it is something I can not do very well.

ID=260099003
Previously, when%username% looked for children,\nAllen talked about various things to make me feel secure.

ID=260099004
It was a story of robot development.\nHe seems to have learned programming from Julie's father.

ID=260099005
We were developing together at the secret base of Ned Company ... and.

ID=260099006
At that time I made a robot called "Punisher α".\nIt was said that Allen made AI together.

ID=260099007
However, the robot seems to be harming the members of the Star Forest Union ... ...\nIt seemed that I was sick suddenly that my robot was hitting people.

ID=260099008
Um ... will not you stop 'Punisher α' for Allen-san?\nI want him to deliver the AI ​​chip inside.

ID=260099009
It is very painful that things my own attacks people ... ....

ID=260099010
Would you please?

ID=660099001
%username%. thank you very much.

ID=660099002
Ok, thank you.

ID=360099001
Please take out the AI ​​chip from "Punisher α" at the secret base of Ned Company.\nCan you deliver it to Mr. Allen? Please.

ID=600990201
Mr.%username% ...? Are you OK?

ID=600990202
(Pass Allen's "AI chip of PAISHER α" to Allen)

ID=600990203
Is this ... AI chip?\nHa! Here, this is no punisher α! What?

ID=600990204
(I told Allen the story)

ID=600990205
Have you been asked by Mr. Ka Ka - chan? For me ...?\nIs it true?

ID=600990206
... I have to go!

ID=600990207
Now it is possible ... maybe.

ID=600990208
Ka, Kacha - san ... confess ...!

ID=600990209
(Allen ran away at a stroke and chased after.)

ID=560099001
Oh, Mr. Allen. Thank you very much before this.

ID=560099002
Huh ha ... Ka, Kacha! I heard the story.\nWow, for me ... I was asked by%username% ... and so on.

ID=560099003
No, it's all%username% did.\nI ... just ....

ID=560099004
No! What is important is that feeling!

ID=560099005
I can say so ... I'm happy. Allen.

ID=560099006
Ka, Mr. Kuracha!

ID=560099007
Yes?

ID=560099008
Wow ... ... Recommended ....

ID=560099009
What? What?

ID=560099010
It is really hot!

ID=560099011
Huh ...? What so ....

ID=560099012
It may be due to mind! Ha, huh ....\nWell then ... then excuse me.

ID=560099013
...? What?

ID=560099014
... Geez. Do not you think, Allen elder brother ....

ID=560099015
You know ... even if I do not get in the way, the result is the same.

ID=560099016
...? What?

ID=560099017
You do not mind if you do not mind, older sister.\nBecause my head only hurts.

ID=560099018
(Julie frown and left)

ID=560099019
Yes Yes. But, my sister's dullness is also quite reasonable.

ID=560099020
(Ted also grinned and went away)

ID=560099021
... What is everyone talking about?\nBut, everyone seems to be fine and good.

ID=560099022
%username%. Thank you for listening to various requests.

ID=460099001
Okay, I will excuse myself. Please take care of yourself.

ID=260099501
Oh Good job.

ID=260099502
Patient who was brought to the hospital a while ago ... was it Laban?

ID=260099503
Medical unit is in treatment ....

ID=260099504
Simply put, the condition is not obvious.\nIf you are an ordinary human being high enough to lose your life ... consciousness has not returned yet.

ID=260099505
We are doing our best, but progress does not exist.\nAt the moment there is no alternative to life, but the possibility not to wake up like this ....

ID=260099506
However, as a person engaged in medical care, we can not wait for this situation with fingers.\nCould you please help me with%username%?

ID=260099507
... Huh? Wow, are you doubting my enthusiasm?\nYes, it is natural as a person engaged in medical care! Jeje.

ID=260099508
Mr. Laban is surely handsome a bit ....\nThat's why I want to help ... that's not it! It's true!

ID=260099509
And, anyway ... The reason why treatment does not advance is because there is no information.\nIt is my first time to see near soul workers ....

ID=260099510
Is not Laban's information somewhere?

ID=260099511
Oh, maybe!\nMr. Laban was discovered by the secret laboratory of Ned Company, right?

ID=260099512
There may be Laban's information there.\nIf there is a possibility, there is only that ....

ID=260099513
Mr.%username%, the situation will fight on time!\nPlease bring Laban's information!\nFrom public to private things ... everything!

ID=260099514
Is there something private about ...?\nThings about the body, family, friends ... and so on.\nIt is such a feeling.

ID=660099501
Well then, please!

ID=360099501
If Mr. Laban was at the secret laboratory, there must be information.\nBring it with me!

ID=560099501
Is this a tip with Laban's data ...?

ID=560099502
Thank you very much.\nI'll send it to the hospital soon and check it.

ID=560099503
It was good ....\nLavan 's data chip is left in the laboratory ....

ID=560099504
Well ... and!\nWell, I will try to analyze the data!

ID=560099505
I have sketch data of Mr. Laban, so I think I can do it soon.

ID=460099501
Thank you very much. %username%.

ID=260100001
Oh,%username%.\nI heard from the hospital the other day.\nIt is said that Laban was awake.

ID=260100002
However ....

ID=260100003
It seems to say something you do not understand something ....

ID=260100004
Analyzing the data chip,\nNed Company Inside the secret laboratory, there seem to be medications and treatments to be administered when problems occur in the brain.

ID=260100005
Ah ... will not you pick me up?

ID=260100006
Sorry to trouble you many times!\nBut, it can not be helped!

ID=260100007
......

ID=260100008
... Please.%username%.\nFor him ... somehow ....

ID=260100009
This is it! Please!

ID=660100001
Oh, thank you!\nThat document is said to be at the bottom floor of the secret laboratory.

ID=660100002
Well then, take care!

ID=360100001
It is medicine of Mr. Laban in the secret laboratory of Ned Company.\nPlease!

ID=560100001
Mr.%username%, how was your medicine?

ID=560100002
(I gave Sora a bag containing the medicine)

ID=560100003
Are you in this bag?

ID=560100004
Thank you very much.\nIf you have this medicine, Laban will be able to speak as well.

ID=560100005
Fuu, you can have a good conversation with this. Jeje.\nThanks to%username%.

ID=560100006
Well then ... then.

ID=560100007
Previously, when only revenge was in my head ....\nIf%username% did not exist ... I surely went on the wrong road.

ID=560100008
To be honest, Colonel Haipu did not fully understand what he said ....\nI feel I understood a little what the colonel wanted to convey.

ID=560100009
I lost myself with revenge ... I stopped not to walk my life with regret and despair.\nAnd ....

ID=560100010
Do not excuse my dead friends ... now you can understand this meaning.

ID=560100011
%username%. I cheated on my friends and robbed Ned Company who robbed their lives ... It does not change.\nI ... I stopped stealing the enemy by killing them.

ID=560100012
I ... I think I like my current job more than I thought.

ID=560100013
So, I can demonstrate my power most ... I will continue this favorite work.\nWe can not fight, but I will show you that only heart can never break!

ID=560100014
Laban's treatment is ... I feel like that.

ID=560100015
He is a man of Ned Company,\nIt is the same as us ... It is also a victim of the Ned Company.

ID=560100016
Well, there is no reason for refusing to treat himself. Tehe.

ID=560100017
Still, feelings are important!

ID=460100001
Thank you for watching me until now.

ID=460100002
Then, please take care of yourself. %username%!

ID=230000501
I was waiting.

ID=230000502
My name is Io.\nHe is a person who carves history in a huge flow.

ID=230000503
... Please do not kill so much.\nI only see you in my appearance.

ID=230000504
You may feel uncomfortable, but I kept watching you forever.\nI burned my eyes to see you falling to this place and making a new history.

ID=230000505
And I was convinced.\nIf you can influence the history of this world.

ID=230000506
I am a person who engraves history ....\nAs for me who feels infinite pleasure in the act itself,\nI could not let you go.

ID=230000507
You are a person who gives me joy.\nTo record the many history you make ... ....\nBy that alone, my boredom will disappear into history.

ID=230000508
As a repayment of that, you have a present.

ID=230000509
Relationship with people until now ... bonds. It is the ability to turn them into your own strength.

ID=230000510
After you fall into this world, the person who built the deepest bond ... that is ....

ID=230000511
(Io seems to think deeper by closing his eyes)

ID=230000512
It looks like a person called "Miriam".\nPlease make promises with this person.

ID=230000513
Promise of becoming your power anytime, anywhere.

ID=630000501
That is enough for now.\nSo, we are waiting for you.

ID=330000501
Please visit those who refer to "Miriam" and make promises.\nIt is your promise that it will become your power at any time.

ID=300005101
Oh, what's wrong?\nWith such a serious face.

ID=300005102
Huh? Please?\nHmm ... I wonder what you ask for with such a serious face.

ID=300005103
......

ID=300005104
Huh? Will you become your strength anytime, anywhere?

ID=300005105
Oh? It does not mean ....\nWell, you are surprisingly bold, are not you?\nI already have trouble with your older sister.

ID=300005106
......

ID=300005107
From that look ... it sounds like a joke.\nWell, alright! I'll do it. It does not decrease either!

ID=300005108
Haha ... but it is kind of embarrassing.\nYou will not do it twice? Please listen properly.

ID=300005109
Anytime, anywhere ... If you need me, you become my strength.\nWhatever it is, wherever I am, I will always be with you\n. Even with this heart alone ....

ID=300005110
......

ID=300005111
Wow! It's more embarrassing than I thought!\nHa ha ...!

ID=300005112
Well ... I do not know the detailed circumstances, but you told me with all my heart?\nBut you can not do it twice. Because a woman who is a good age can not speak lightly.\nWoohoo.

ID=300005113
Hey Hey, come quick.\nIt's hard to see your face ashamed. Huff.

ID=530000501
I confirmed the establishment of the contract.

ID=530000502
That person's words deeply related to you ....\nIt will be an absolute contract proof and it will be together until that time of your history being lost.

ID=530000503
From now on, you can "borrow" the history of that person whenever you need, as the contract.

ID=530000504
Originally it can not be materialized,\nOnly when you borrow that history can exist as being real.

ID=530000505
Can you say "supporter" in your words?\nI hope that this contract will be your strength.

ID=430000501
Actually, I was a little surprised.\nYou have made a contract with a person who has a border,\nNormally, the opponent learns intense rejection.

ID=430000502
It is natural that you will leave a part of your history to other people's hands.\nBut that person signed a contract with you without hesitation ....

ID=430000503
... That deep bond was far beyond my imagination.

ID=430000504
From now on, you will have a lot of contracts with many people.\nBut please do not think that it is as easy as this time.

ID=430000505
As I said earlier, contracts are something that can not be easily tied ... that is reason.

ID=430000506
Because of the feeling of refusal that I feel instinctively, I may be given a ridiculous request.

ID=430000507
But do not give up, deepen your ties, please sign a contract.\nThat way your history will be more powerful.

ID=430000508
Well then ... let's meet again soon.\nIt was nice to meet you.\nOne who spins the history of eternity.

ID=230001001
Welcome. I'm very pleased that we were able to meet again.

ID=230001002
I kept watching the history you made.\nYou seem to have given a lot of pleasure.

ID=230001003
The fact that you visited me means that the time to join a new moment came.\nA person who binds a new relationship ... that is ....

ID=230001004
(Io seems to think deeper by closing his eyes)

ID=230001005
... This is Ralph.

ID=230001006
Oh, is it surprising? Hehe ...\nBut, you and your ties are reaching a stage where new contracts can be established.

ID=230001007
Kizuna is a thing that trusts invisible to the eyes become entangled and gradually deepens.\nOriginally it may be a hard-to-notice part of the person.

ID=230001008
Well, it's time to sign a contract.\nDo you remember the contract process?

ID=230001009
That's right. Visiting the contract subject,\nTo promise to be your power anytime anywhere.

ID=230001010
Again, we need to make promises again.

ID=230001011
As I said before, due to the rejection of "reasoning" by the world,\nFrom that person you may be asked for ridiculous things.

ID=230001012
However, please do not defeat the rejection of "reason". If you meet that requirement and make a splendid promise,\nYour history will be even stronger.

ID=230001013
Then, please make promises with "Ralph".\nPromise of becoming your power anytime, anywhere.

ID=630001001
be careful.\nI am looking forward to your new contract.

ID=330001001
Please make a promise for a new contract with a person named "Ralf".\nIf you respond to that person's request, the contract will work.

ID=300010101
How are you? that's unusual. You come from me to me.

ID=300010102
Hmm? Do you want me to make a promise? What promise?\n... I, have you borrowed money from you ...?

ID=300010103
Hmm? Is it different? Hmm ... what on earth is he promised?

ID=300010104
......

ID=300010105
When, anywhere ...?\nYou can often say such embarrassing things.

ID=300010106
Well, if it is only to say, it is not difficult.\nBut, I do not want to say something like this easily ....

ID=300010107
Well, somewhere.\nBut, instead of asking one of my requests instead?

ID=300010108
I, I used to work quite huge business.\nBut, as you know, the world economy is destroyed.\nBecause of that, my company has completely collapsed.

ID=300010109
However, the money borrowed from bad luck remains as it is, and it is the end of surviving until borrowing.\nYou can not earn money, but you have to return the debt. It's the worst! What?

ID=300010110
Wow ... that is! What I want to say ....\nI borrowed money from the merchant association 'Yomi' to return that money ....

ID=300010111
Of course, I did not lend that money for free.\nI deposited my "mercenary contract" as collateral.

ID=300010112
Since I was in a hurry at the time I borrowed it, I deposited it as collateral without thinking anything,\nActually, without the "mercenary contracts" it seems that no matter how much work you do danger you will not get enough money.

ID=300010113
So why ... can you return money to 'yomi' instead of me and regain my 'mercenary contract'?\nIf you do that, I will do as much as I promise!

ID=300010201
Welcome. Shopping?

ID=300010202
... Is it wrong? Then, for what purpose ...?

ID=300010203
......

ID=300010204
... I want Ralph's 'mercenary contract' ...?\nwhy? Did you lend money to Mr. Ralph?

ID=300010205
... I see. Do you mean buying and returning instead of listening to a wish?\nWell ... Actually, Mr. Ralph has not refunded by the due date, so I already put it in the selling list.

ID=300010206
Since I am a merchant, I move according to the rules of the merchant.\nWell, fortunately I still have to sell. I bet there is no demand.

ID=300010207
So, according to the rules of the merchant again this time.

ID=300010208
Regarding this, I can not pass it by simply saying%%username%.\nThis is consideration for "lent money".

ID=300010209
I will make the price half of the money borrowed by Mr. Ralph.\nIf you are not%username% you will not do this.

ID=300010210
By the way, Mr. Ralph is really lucky.\nBut%username%. If you listen to all your wishes in that way, it will be a big deal someday so moderately.

ID=300010211
see you.

ID=300010401
Oh! Have you already returned?

ID=300010402
Let's see ... Well! It's my "mercenary contract"! Was saved!\nThanks to you you got out of the pinch.

ID=300010403
Well, it's been a long time since you came to Kandus city.\nPress! It seems time has come to finally come back.

ID=300010404
More than anything, although the value of gold has dropped compared to before,\nFor ordinary people like me it has become more important than before.

ID=300010405
If you used me that much important money without hesitation for me,\nI trust!

ID=300010406
promise!\nIf you need me anytime, anywhere, I will be your strength anytime!

ID=300010407
I promise by qualification as my mercenary and important money!

ID=300010408
... Is this right?\nWas it really helpful for you alone?

ID=300010409
Well, if you say so, you do not.\nWhew, it is not a pattern. Here, go ahead! It's pretty embarrassing!

ID=530001001
I confirmed the establishment of the contract.

ID=530001002
That person's words deeply related to you ....\nIt will be an absolute contract proof and it will be together until that time of your history being lost.

ID=530001003
"Ralph" was added as your new "supporter".

ID=430001001
You perfectly canceled the rejection of "reason".\n... It is truly.

ID=430001002
Well then, until the day we can see you again ....\nOne who spins the history of eternity. Please take care.

ID=230001501
Welcome. He who spun eternal history.

ID=230001502
It was led by the way of ties and came to make a new contract.\nI'm very pleased that we were able to meet again.

ID=230001503
This time who connects with you ... that is ....

ID=230001504
(Io seems to think deeper by closing his eyes)

ID=230001505
... It is the direction of "HI DINGER".

ID=230001506
Oh? You are quite surprised.\nWas it surprising?

ID=230001507
He is a cowardly person.\nIt seems that the process that you visited has given deep trust and ties to him.

ID=230001508
Well, it's time to sign a contract.\nPromises are necessary this time as well.

ID=230001509
Those who are "Hai Dingers" should also have a rejection of instinctive "reason" just as timid.\nHis demands may be even more difficult than those of the past.

ID=230001510
If you act without always giving up, you ought to be able to sign a contract.

ID=230001511
Those who make eternal bonds.\nPlease give me the promise of "Hijinger" and the one who will be your strength anytime and anywhere.

ID=630001501
I do not think I will go easy this time, but I believe you can do it.\nPlease take care.

ID=330001501
Please make a promise for a new contract with those who are "Hai Dingers".\nIt will be difficult, but if you respond to that person's request, the contract will work as well.

ID=300015101
What!\nWell, I do not want to talk with anyone!

ID=300015102
Well, I promise you ...?\nWhat, what!

ID=300015103
Yes, anytime anywhere? That's why ....\nNot ... I will not do it!

ID=300015104
Well, I will not get out of here! It is not ... so I can not get out!

ID=300015105
(Although the lid of the trash box was closed with the sound of cancer, I feel a gaze of peeking through here from the gap)

ID=300015106
(I knocked the trash box)

ID=300015107
(There was a little, but there was a reaction, I knocked the trash again once again)

ID=300015108
What is it!\nAlready! I will tell you as it is noisy as it is!

ID=300015109
In the bottom of the laboratory, there are experimental bodies that live there.\nEven before I said, all the experiments were completed there.

ID=300015110
There are dividing cells available only from the experimental body.\nIf you bring it, ... or you can do promises.

ID=300015111
Well, let me tell you! That experimental body is much more dangerous than the previous experimental body!\nBesides, even if you meet him you will definitely get it!

ID=300015112
I, I advised you!\nOh, you decide whether or not to do it!

ID=300015113
(The lid of the trash box is closed, apparently it seems better to bring dividing cells)

ID=300015301
(I placed dividing cells in the trash box)

ID=300015302
Oh! Have you really brought it ...! Even though it should not be easy!

ID=300015303
Hey, hey! If you really bring it you can not refuse!\nWhy are you all due to you! It's because of you!

ID=300015304
O, if you are ... maybe I might manage to do something that will happen.\nall right! And promise you!

ID=300015305
Well, anytime, anywhere, if you need me,\nOr be sure to become a force!

ID=300015306
But! From here I will not take a step!\nJust remember that!

ID=300015307
This is satisfied with this! Go already!\nDo not come again!

ID=530001501
I confirmed the establishment of the contract.

ID=530001502
That person's words deeply related to you ....\nIt will be an absolute contract proof and it will be together until that time of your history being lost.

ID=530001503
As a new "supporter" you join "Hijinger".

ID=430001501
People's edge ... seems to have perfectly learned how to tie the contract.\nThe strong rejection of the contractor was dispelled spectacularly.

ID=430001502
I understand that the power of your history will gradually become stronger as the contract proceeds.

ID=430001503
Then, those who spinning the history of eternity.\nI hope that there will be a blessing of history until that time to see you again.

ID=230002501
Welcome.\nI am glad to have overcome the history of suffering and sorrow and I am pleased to meet you again.

ID=230002502
To visit here means that the time has come to connect a new edge.\nThis time, those who connect your new ties ... That is ....

ID=230002503
(Io seems to think deeper by closing his eyes)

ID=230002504
... This time I was bound to a special person by a rim.\nIt is not a human but an animal.

ID=230002505
As you can imagine ...,\nThe one who connects the ties this time is the one called "Good boy".

ID=230002506
How can I make a promise ...?\nHuh ... You certainly can not hear directly with human words.

ID=230002507
But if that person pledges his promise in his language,\nYou should be able to listen regardless of language.

ID=230002508
If that happens, the contract will come naturally.

ID=230002509
Huhu ... It may be difficult to understand,\nIf you hit it directly, the road may open.

ID=230002510
Then, please make promises with those who say "Good boy".\nPromise of becoming your power anytime, anywhere.

ID=630002501
I wish you a new edge.

ID=330002501
Please bring a promise to become a power of yours at any time with a "Goodboy" person.\nEven if the words are different, we are sure to be able to communicate with each other.

ID=300025101
(Io I promised the word to the good boy)

ID=300025102
one! one! Gurururu!

ID=300025103
(Good boy seems to be suffering)

ID=300025104
one! one! Bow-wow!

ID=300025105
(Although it seems just to be barking, I feel that something is necessary for promising for some reason)

ID=300025106
(Good boys suddenly started up, I got the ID tag of Chris I found earlier)

ID=300025107
one! Woo! Bow-wow! !

ID=300025108
(I'm not quite sure what you are talking about, but it seems like you want something about my husband, Chris)

ID=300025109
one! one! Dogwang!

ID=300025110
(It is barking while watching the second expressway, there seems to be something)

ID=300025111
(Let's find something related to Chris on the second expressway)

ID=300025301
Wow! Wow! Gurururu ...! !

ID=300025302
(Goodboy reacts violently just by holding Chris' perfume)

ID=300025303
(I quickly took out Chris' perfume and put it on the ground)

ID=300025304
Wowon! Wow! Wow! Wowon! !

ID=300025305
(Good boy bent over Chris' perfume and began to bark like a wolf)

ID=300025306
(The howling of Goodboy, as if mourning his master's death, continued for a while)

ID=300025307
Won! Won!

ID=300025308
(I'm sorry, I ceased sleeping and chewed my cuff)

ID=300025309
Wow! Bow-wow! Kuon - ...! !

ID=300025310
(I do not know clearly, but it seems to make an oath of promises)

ID=300025311
(I feel the eyes of trust from the Goodboy)

ID=300025312
Wow! Bow-wow! !

ID=300025313
(As I say, even if the words are different, the promised oath seems to be exchanged, and return to Io)

ID=530002501
I confirmed the establishment of the contract.

ID=530002502
That person's words deeply related to you ....\nIt will be an absolute contract proof and it will be together until that time of your history being lost.

ID=530002503
As a new "supporter" you join "Goodboy".

ID=430002501
I thought that you could do it well.\nIt seems that you have understood well the bonds and the bonds well. What is more.

ID=430002502
As you have felt this time, promises are,\nIt does not hold only in the language we know well.\nA bond that is tied firmly with the feelings of believing in each other is a promise.

ID=430002503
Huh ... Well then, until the day we can see you again. Please take care.

ID=230002001
Welcome.\nHe who spun eternal history.

ID=230002002
To be here,\nIt seems time has come to tie a new edge.

ID=230002003
This time, those who connect with you ... that is ....

ID=230002004
(Io seems to think deeper by closing his eyes)

ID=230002005
... Finally, the connection with this one is bound.

ID=230002006
This time, already me ... Because I am a person who knows the existence of "us\\nHowever, because it is known, it is considered difficult.

ID=230002007
Why is it "us" ...?\nI also said that I met you for the first time, but my presence is visible only to you.\nAnd there are also "Io" of only that person in other people who have the same power as you.

ID=230002008
"We" that engrave history exists as "us" with those who make history.\nHowever, "we" does not exist as individual individuals.

ID=230002009
"We" are all "one\\nHuh ... Is that difficult? I am your only "Io". Please remember that much.

ID=230002010
Even those who connect this edge also know "Io" only for that person.\nDid you notice?

ID=230002011
Yes, the one who connects this time is "Kane Barrel".

ID=230002012
Rather than a request from instinctive refusal by "reason"\nI think that we will ask for an "exam" as a person who makes history.\nThat is also a process.

ID=230002013
Then, one who is "Kane Barrel"\nPlease make promises that you will become your power anytime, anywhere.

ID=630002001
I am thrilled more than usual this time.\nYou can stand at the moment when history and history intersect ...!

ID=630002002
I am looking forward to it.

ID=330002001
Please make promises for a new contract with those who are "Kane Barrel".\nWell then, we are waiting.

ID=300020101
For what? noob.

ID=300020102
......

ID=300020103
The time has come for you to hear the word "promise" from you.\nTime passes quickly.

ID=300020104
To say "promised" means that I met "her".\nAnd ... It means that we have a bond.

ID=300020105
Hmm? Are you surprised that you know "promise"?\nI have been to and fro with "promises." It is not surprising at all.

ID=300020106
Because I am a soul worker too.

ID=300020107
As you know, for "promises" you need to overcome the rejection of "reason".\nBut I am a soul worker too. A person who refuses "reason" and has signed a "contract".

ID=300020108
Rather than a sense of refusal of "reason"\nAs a person who refused "reason\

ID=300020109
A person who "certifies" with me and "trusts" it is "strength".\nIn other words, it depends on whether you can trust me behind.

ID=300020110
There it is. I will make one suggestion from me.

ID=300020111
After the phantom case, traces of unfamiliar shadows remain,\nIt seems that the recovery work of the victim's body is in a difficult direction.

ID=300020112
Solve this and prove your "strength".\nThat's the "test" I promise you "promise".

ID=300020113
Let's say you wait until that time to prove "strength".

ID=300020301
I heard about the story that you exterminated the trace of the shadow.

ID=300020302
It was a hard time.\nI understood your "strength" well.

ID=300020303
Let's promise. Whenever you need me, no matter where you are\nI will definitely become a force.

ID=300020304
I swear by this "power" of mine.

ID=300020305
The word of this "contract" is a little shy, every time. Oh!

ID=300020306
Now, quickly return to "her" place.

ID=530002001
I confirmed the establishment of the contract.

ID=530002002
That person's words deeply related to you ....\nIt will be an absolute contract proof and it will be together until that time of your history being lost.

ID=530002003
"Kane Barrel" was added as your new "supporter".

ID=430002001
It has passed through the "test" of another person who spins another history, is not it?\nThat moment when history and history can be seen. However, I saw it with this eyes.

ID=430002002
Looking at your power of gradually increasing strength, I feel like being satisfied.

ID=430002003
Then, if you are blessed with another edge,\nLet's meet again.

ID=430002004
I hope the flow of history will be with you till that day.

ID=260100501
The matter of the arousal body was a pain.\nDid you get used to battle much?

ID=260100502
Then let's tell you good information.\nIt's about existence called vacuum irregular.

ID=260100503
Representative examples of existence of a different world that appeared in the world after the blank are "Soul Junk" and "Vesi".\nHowever, special existence which can not define features other than that is called "vacuum irregular".

ID=260100504
There is no definite matter as to whether there is intelligence or acting in a group.\nThe only thing that is clear is that they move for their own purpose.

ID=260100505
Its purpose also depends on individuals. If an individual simply rotates on the spot,\nAn individual keeps digging the ground all the time.

ID=260100506
There is a vacuum irregular called "gluton" in it.\nIt suddenly appears and eats everything in the surroundings.

ID=260100507
It is not hostile to humans, but suddenly it swallows what is falling to the surroundings.\nIt is a situation close to surprise. It's not that serious, but not a little damage.

ID=260100508
According to the survey so far, the glutton is not militant personality.\nIt seems most of the time that it appeared suddenly, it disappears after going around in the vicinity.

ID=260100509
If glutton appears during battle, it will definitely punitive. What Gluton swallowed,\nIt may be fused internally within the gluton to be completely new.

ID=660100501
It will not appear so easily,\nIf you keep on waiting patiently it will surely come across.

ID=660100502
Keep in mind one thing.\nGlutton appears suddenly. You should not be careless.

ID=360100501
Glutton appears suddenly.\nAlways be careful.

ID=560100501
Hmm ... Looks like I met Gluton.\nAfter all it seems you are in luck.

ID=560100502
From now on, glutton will show up.\nWhenever you knock it down, you can get something precious.

ID=460100501
... It really was.\nThere is something glutton.

ID=260101001
Oh! Are you an interrogator who recently solves the problem of Locotown?

ID=260101002
I am Perry who is a producer of lion television.\nIt was acknowledged with exciting broadcast material and excellent editing technology ... now it is the same as the unemployed.

ID=260101003
So what? ... I want to borrow your power.

ID=260101004
I can feel unnecessary to ask such a request for the first time meeting.\nJust a little better! Lend me your strength!

ID=260101005
Let's meet ... see that wagon.\nIs not it so suspicious? It smells like a special one.

ID=260101006
Perhaps it is that crime, a criminal who is called "alchemist".\n... I never heard that story is such a child, but it looks just like a dress heard in the story.

ID=260101007
Alchemist is engaged in illegal equipment production for opponent parties. You have taken a huge amount of money.

ID=260101008
If that brat is really an alchemist ....\nI will be reinstatement right away with the merits of special duty ... Furthermore I may be able to get promoted and get married!

ID=660101001
Alright, hurry up!\nI smell the special one!

ID=360101001
So why do not you go for a moment.\nReveal the identity of the poor thing like that suspicious criminal! !

ID=601010101
Oh, I finally came!\nI am Zenith. Alright, soul worker.

ID=601010102
Hmm? What's amazing? I carry so much dignified weapons.\nI can understand it at a glance unless it is stupid. I am not stupid.

ID=601010103
Well anyway, if it is a soul worker,\nOf course you should target a strong force?

ID=601010104
Recently, it is said that there are few Seoul workers, as well as foreigners,\nDo we lose each other if we lose our lives weakly and easily? The Starry Forest Association is also me.

ID=601010105
Well, I'd recommend taking advantage of my power.\nDisassemble and reassemble various materials ... It is the so-called "production" ability.

ID=601010106
Why do people call me "alchemist Zenith of the Twilight"? I love you.

ID=601010107
What to prepare is the material and design drawing of the thing you want to make.\nI will make anything if there is this. Easy, right?

ID=601010108
Do not look at a glance at a glance! Why do not you try it?\nIs there any material that is buried ... Well ... Is not it?

ID=601010109
Okay, because I will be serving this time.\nAnyway, please accept this.

ID=601010110
You look like a garach, do not you? But, I am different.\nPlease try asking me to "make it" with him. I will show you interesting things.

ID=560101001
How was it? Did you say something?

ID=460101001
What! !\nI wonder if he is Zenith!

ID=460101002
I found it! At last it is a super special daneguette!

ID=460101003
This is not the case when you are doing this ...!\nTake ... Oh no ... Cover!

ID=460101004
Different ...! It's a camera! First off from the camera!\nPoor! ! Speaking of which ... I do not have a photographer now! Let's do it! !

ID=460101005
A photographer is not limited in such a time ...!\nIf Cynthia did not even bring Hugh, it was a super special daneguette! Huh ....

ID=460101006
...! That's it! You should be a temporary photographer! Heheh, why does reward bounce?

ID=460101007
Even if you do not feel that way, you will come only to be here with me.\nIt seems that there is a backside for the equipment for soul workers that will be offered at the Star Forest Alliance ...)

ID=460101008
(There seems to be a backside for equipment for soul workers that will be offered at the Star Forest Alliance ...)

ID=460101009
(There seems to be a back, so ...)

ID=460101010
Hey! Would you lend me a hand or not? Which one!

ID=460101011
(... the words of Zenith echoes in my mind, let's keep silent now)

ID=460101012
Ayah!\nIf I knew that this would happen I did not let go go even though I bound Hugh! Damn it!

ID=260102501
% username %% usergender_2%! I decided to attend!

ID=260102502
I will go to Daddy with confidence to Setsuka, Ryoko Oya-chan!

ID=260102503
Daddy did not return, even though I have always been patient.\nI do not know anything about liars. I will not play with you!

ID=260102504
So,% username %% usergender_2% lend me your strength! all right?

ID=260102505
Going a little from here, there is the same airplane as the plane that Dad was driving.\nThere! I have a sister who was working with my dad!\nBut that sister, it is a little idiot.

ID=260102506
Although Setsuka asked me to carry it many times,\nI had no money and did not let me get it!\nIs not it stingy? Is not it?

ID=260102507
% username %% usergender_2% persuade Setsuka to get on the plane!

ID=660102501
Thanks! % username %% usergender_2%!\nJust say it properly! all right?

ID=360102501
Hey, Setsuka, when can you see Dad? Can you fly an airplane? Nene?

ID=601025101
It is corporate corporation "Azin" of the 6th section branch of the Star Forest Union. Do you use skycraft?

ID=601025102
(Talk to me that you put a secret on Azin)

ID=601025103
Oh ... Is it again Setsuka?

ID=601025104
I brought Lieutenant Liu before this. Is this your turn?

ID=601025105
I will tell you straight away. That's impossible.

ID=601025106
I have already received my life that Major Cayenne should never place it.\nAnd this is military helicopter ... It is not a child's toy.

ID=601025107
... Anyway I can not accept it.\nI will talk to Setsuka again from me.

ID=601025108
You need to stab a nail so that Setsuka will not annoy others around him.

ID=560102501
Oh, please do not worry as you can use it normally.

ID=560102502
Although it is unusual, you already have permission to use from the headquarters.

ID=560102503
Well, if you do not want to ride it is fine even if you walk directly.\nAs you know, the sixth area is occupied by Seoul Junk.

ID=560102504
If you go on foot, you will encounter many monsters,\nIt will not be possible with your power now. No matter how much you are a strong competitor.

ID=560102505
So with me the Star Forest Alliance, I and Skycraft were dispatched to the 6th area.\nFortunately there are no monsters flying in the sky in this area, so we can move relatively safely.

ID=560102506
In other areas, skycraft will fly in a difficult situation,\nIt can be said that it is a blessed situation compared with it.

ID=560102507
Anyway, if you are going to another city with Sky Craft please give me a shout.

ID=460102501
Oh, it is not free, so you can not open it even if you come by hand. Is that okay?

ID=260103001
Oh,%username%!

ID=260103002
I asked Mr. Eric about the story.\nThings that have given life to save this city ....

ID=260103003
I think that it is really amazing.\nThe mediocrity like me was all I could do by running away ....

ID=260103004
Um ... why is that, there is something you want to pass to%username%!\nPlease, receive it!

ID=260103005
(Ryoko handed out the small and trivial key)

ID=260103006
Do you know what this is?\nActually ... It is the key of the attic of my house!

ID=260103007
I heard that the place to rest for%username% is not decided ....\nUh, please use it if you want!

ID=260103008
It is a room that nobody uses anyway ... and,\nBecause I am afraid to be in such a big house with me and Setsuka.

ID=260103009
how is it?\nOh, of course, I will keep the rent cheap!

ID=260103010
Why do not you look at the room once it's ok?

ID=260103011
You can move by selecting My Room from the menu (default setting "V" key).\nPlease take a look!

ID=660103001
Please check it out.\nOh, but please do not go to bed on the floor because you like it! I have not done cleaning yet ....

ID=360103001
Haha! I can not thank you!\nBecause I am a person who appreciates it. Come now to the room!

ID=601030101
Welcome to the "My room system" policy to secure personal living space!

ID=601030102
When you register personal information in my room, the corresponding space will be the name of the registrant.\nCurrently, there are no registrants in this private living space.

ID=601030103
Do you register this here in the name of yourself?

ID=601030104
(Press "Yes")

ID=601030105
Just now, the owner of this personal living space has become%username% sama.

ID=601030106
You can arrange your own space freely.\nEnjoy my room as much as you like, from furniture to wallpaper and accessories.

ID=601030107
In addition, materials processing and furniture production can be done in the My room terminal machine.\nHowever, please note that when designing base materials and specific furniture, a separate design drawing is required.

ID=601030108
The explanation of my room system is over.\nPlease enjoy a nice My room life.

ID=560103001
how is it? I was fine?

ID=560103002
eh? There was nothing at home ...?\nHaha. Actually it costs money even if I want furniture ....

ID=560103003
It is a bit inconvenient, but you have to buy or make furniture. Ahahahaha ....

ID=560103004
But is not it nice to have your own house?\nThere are plenty of fields, you can eat and sell organic vegetables you brought up yourself.

ID=560103005
Of course, if it does not work as it is, the price without labor is not worth anything!\nTruth is the truth! He who does not work can not eat it!

ID=560103006
Oh, and if a lot of friends and friends can do it, I may be able to work happily.\nIf you are a friend you willingly help me do not you?

ID=460103001
Huh ... Well then, thank you in the future.

ID=260103501
Welcome! !

ID=260103502
Oh, you came in a nice place!\nNow, new merchandise has been sent from the merchant association.\nWhy? Is it something I do not see?

ID=260103503
Although it is a new product developed by Merchant Association "Magic Hammer"\nIt's an excellent one that can disassemble unnecessary equipment and items!

ID=260103504
Usage is easy.\nJust swing down the magic hammer to the thing you want to disassemble!

ID=260103505
With this, disassemble items you are having trouble with,\nYou can make useful materials!

ID=260103506
From such an era. Materials can only be obtained by yourself.\nIn that sense, this is really a magical hammer.

ID=260103507
As a precaution, it is said that only one can be disassembled at a time,\nIt is a point that you can not reuse after use. In other words, it is one time.

ID=260103508
It seems that I am trying to improve it, but it seems that there are no results yet.\nWell, because it's for one time it's possible to sell it! Ha ha ha!

ID=260103509
Oh, and the merchant association deals with large magic hammers.\nUnlike ordinary, you can use it many times.

ID=260103510
Besides, it is a big difference that you can disassemble multiple items at once.\nI will leave it up to what to use.

ID=260103511
When you want to use a large magic hammer, please talk to a merchant of a merchant association.\nOf course, you get the commission. Well then, I'll give this magic hammer and my watch.

ID=660103501
It's a watch picked up a while ago, but it's perfectly broken. Please try disassembling it.\nI'm sure you'll be surprised.

ID=360103501
Then, please try disassembling with that magic hammer!

ID=560103501
How was the magic hammer?

ID=560103502
Please continue to use this guy!\nHonestly, there is no demand unless this is soul worker level. I have a hard day 's business.

ID=560103503
On this occasion, please be a regular customer of disassembly! Ha ha ha!

ID=460103501
It seems like you can disassemble Seoul weapons and gears when you heard it!

ID=460103502
... Huh? What should I do after disassembly?

ID=460103503
Uh ... I can not say it's a big voice, though. Actually, if there is only material now\nIt seems that you are coming to town that you make anything.

ID=460103504
If you ask him, you can make it in Seoul Weapon or Gear even with the material you got disassembled! Ha ha ha!

ID=460103505
Well, I will return to work here! Might be there! %username%!

ID=460103506
Hey, Jight! Did not you see the broken watch?\nOh, I thought about putting it for repair today!

ID=460103507
Watches?\nI do not know.

ID=460103508
... Really ...?

ID=460103509
..., what kind of thing?\nIt's true.

ID=460103510
%username%.\nYou hid something to me?

ID=460103511
(I talked to Yomi what the Jite used for the experiment of the new product)

ID=460103512
All right! I wonder if I will return to work soon ...! !

ID=460103513
Jite! You ...!

ID=260104001
Hey,%username%.

ID=260104002
A few days ago, I received a message from Steel Grave's Virtual Training Program Development Institute.

ID=260104003
While you are active in Kandusity,\nIt seems to have updated new enemies with the data collected so far.

ID=260104004
Kane Barrel seems to have taken the test training, but it seems quite awful.

ID=260104005
How about it? Breathing out and trying to try steel grave at the same time.\nYou should try preparing your mind before the next strategy begins.

ID=660104001
If you clear all newly added programs,\nIt seems that additional fee will be issued from the laboratory. Please tell me when it's over.

ID=360104001
I do not seem to be doing everything yet.\nLet's talk again when we do all the newly updated programs,%username%.

ID=560104001
Yup? What's wrong? %username%.

ID=560104002
Have you cleared the program yet?\nWho ... ... seems to be true.

ID=560104003
... When Kain Barrel hears this, he will pull out.\nHe ought not expected, such as you clear up so soon.

ID=560104004
I'm looking forward to the future.\nOriginally there were not so many soul workers, but as many people as you were since Kane Barrel.

ID=460104001
Hm ... but the laboratory is too hard.\nThanks to%username%, I am going to work overtime again. Ha ha ha!

ID=460104002
Besides, I will not break the record of Kane Barrel.

ID=260104501
New, something a little better?

ID=260104502
Abnormal phenomena are occurring in the outskirts of Grace City now.

ID=260104503
I do not see it directly, so I do not know the details, but according to the information sent,\nIt seems like a dimensional disaster like a twisted air wavelength has occurred. Like blanks.

ID=260104504
Thor commander dispatched an emergency investigation team, but all disappeared.

ID=260104505
As long as I saw the last picture sent from the missing survey team ....\nThe inside of the crack was very similar to that around Locotown. However, the atmosphere is a completely different thing.

ID=260104506
I also contacted Miriam to confirm.\nBut I did not see anything strange. Rather, I was glad to contact you for the first time in a while.

ID=260104507
Haa ... Anyway, I feel something bad feeling.\nEven though it's just a bad thing due to the Ned Company, even a dimensional disaster ...! Completely ...!

ID=260104508
In addition, only expansion that abnormal phenomenon expansion and addition occurrence are not confirmed can be saved ....\nThat's why you can not leave it alone. I also need to check that the research team is safe ....

ID=260104509
noob. After all it seems to only have you go.

ID=260104510
Please check out what's going on inside.\nI wonder what happened, what happened, and how the men could not come back.

ID=660104501
Well then, please.

ID=360104501
Quickly!\nPerhaps they still have living members! What?

ID=560104501
You got a new entry, did not you?\nWhat on earth was going on?

ID=560104502
(I explained everything that happened in the dimension disaster to Senior)

ID=560104503
What's that? doll?\nA doll resembling a blue clown clown?

ID=560104504
All the members are hit by dolls ....\nClowns are similar in appearance but obviously different existences ... I have a bad feeling.

ID=560104505
Hmm? Please wait a moment.\nThe headquarters just contacted us.

ID=560104506
(Senior is in contact with someone.\nThe voice gradually became higher and the expression of Senia became very steep)

ID=560104507
Fuu ....

ID=560104508
It seems that the investigation by headquarters has been completed ... So, what do you think it was?

ID=560104509
... It's a secret.

ID=560104510
......

ID=560104511
Do not you think it is a terrible story?\nThey in the headquarters are peaceful. In peace like this Haribote.

ID=560104512
Is it a secret ...?\nI think that what we are doing is working in the field.

ID=560104513
If newcomers did not go, we did not know anything, right?

ID=560104514
It is useless. I made it easy to finish, but it does not work this time.\nI wonder if I have to mess up the briefing room?

ID=560104515
Se, Senia, calm down.

ID=560104516
The headquarters guys can not really trust what you are doing recently.\nEven if I do not do anything, if things stay like this, serious things will happen?

ID=560104517
Xenia.

ID=560104518
Oh, I'm sorry.\nIt was not a thing to say before a newcomer .... Please forget it. Good?

ID=460104501
Anyway, thanks for your hard work.\nPlease rest a little.

ID=230003001
Welcome. He who spun eternal history.

ID=230003002
We are welcomed by being led by the way of ties and coming to join a new edge contract.

ID=230003003
That you came here is the time to sign a new contract.\nThis time you sign a contract ... that is ....

ID=230003004
(Io seems to think deeper by closing his eyes)

ID=230003005
... It is the direction of "Ryu".

ID=230003006
He thought that it is not easy to gain trust only by a cautious person ... ...\nIt is still interesting to get bonds enough to contract.

ID=230003007
Giggle As I mentioned earlier, you need to visit the subject of the contract and make promises.

ID=230003008
However, due to the refusal by "reason" of the world,\nFrom that person it may be "requested" outrageous things.

ID=230003009
If you can satisfy those "demands" and have a splendid "promise"\nYour history will be even stronger.

ID=230003010
... What do you care about outrageous "demands"?\nGiggle It's okay. You should know what you mean by actually experiencing it.

ID=230003011
Since this time is a prudent one, there will be "demand" of course,\nBecause it is a gentle person, it should not be requested beyond degree.

ID=230003012
Well, it is about time.\nPlease make promises for a new contract with those who are "Liu".

ID=230003013
Promise of becoming your power anytime, anywhere.

ID=630003001
I am looking forward to your new contract.

ID=330003001
Please make a promise for a new contract with those who are "Liu".\nA contract will be established if promised with that person.

ID=300030101
What happened?\nIs there something for me?

ID=300030102
......

ID=300030103
HM .... Promised?\nApart from the content of the promise, there is something dangerous.

ID=300030104
I know that you solved many problems of Loco Town and I am thankful for that.\nBut why do not you feel a sense of refusal for the words before.

ID=300030105
... It's strange.\nIt is only a word, such as a promise.

ID=300030106
I do not know the reason, but I feel like I have to receive something appropriate.\nThere is a strange mission sense.

ID=300030107
Therefore, I will ask you one thing as a consideration for promises.

ID=300030108
Actually, even after you defeated the blue clown clown,\nThere seems to be a rumor that you can see hallucinations of a blue fiery clown in a closed ward.

ID=300030109
To find out the truth of the rumor, we need to search for closed wards ....\nEveryone hesitated the word "blue fiery clown" but scared of fear, hesitant to enter.

ID=300030110
However, I can not leave it as it is.\nGo to the closing ward once more and locate the truth of the rumor.

ID=300030111
I'm begging you.

ID=300030301
Have you already returned? It was a pain.

ID=300030302
(Hand over Leu "traces of agglomerated madness")

ID=300030303
Is this the identity of the hallucination that the clown of the blue flame left?

ID=300030304
It did a good job. This will free a lot of people from fear.\nBesides, I reduced the sacrifice to investigate the truth.

ID=300030305
I am grateful also as individual.

ID=300030306
... Indeed, I also had a fear of blue fiery clown.

ID=300030307
It surely was I who could not win ... I thought that I could not win,\nIt was because it was a person who was lightly dismissed.

ID=300030308
... to oppose such a person over and over and to overcome ....\nI express my sincere appreciation and respect for your "will".

ID=300030309
You overcome the fear of the mighty power that threatens life,\nHe who has a decisive "will" to protect others.

ID=300030310
According to your will, I will protect you.

ID=300030311
Let's promise.\nNo matter where you are and when you need me you will definitely be your strength.

ID=300030312
......

ID=300030313
... Hm, I was more shy than I thought.\nIt is impossible to say that I can say it again.

ID=300030314
Well, let's meet again.

ID=530003001
I confirmed the establishment of the contract.

ID=530003002
That person's words with deep margins are ....\nIt will be an absolute contract proof and it will be together until that time of your history being lost.

ID=530003003
"Ryu" was added as your new "supporter".

ID=430003001
You surpassed superbly the sense of refusal by "reason".\nYou are a really interesting person.

ID=430003002
Giggle Let's meet again when the fellows meet.\nOk, fine.

ID=210054501
Hmm? This is a no-entry zone for the general public.\nGo home soon.

ID=210054502
No, wait. How does an ordinary person stay here?\nWho are you?

ID=210054503
......

ID=210054504
I see. Were you a rumorous soul worker?\nI'm listening to the story.

ID=210054505
Another name was ... "Shinigami"? Ha ha ha.

ID=210054506
... It is a joke. Do not look at me with such eyes.

ID=210054507
I'm Martin.\nIt is dispatched as commander in Ruin Fortress.

ID=210054508
You are the commander only by name. It is an emergency military force, there is no command system.\nThey are those who have never eaten the same kettle. If you open your mouth you just fight.

ID=210054509
Dispatch an immediate team to an important mission of tracking a near soul worker itself,\nIt is like saying that the upper part is incompetent.

ID=210054510
The most masterpiece is that the commander I can hardly comprehend the current situation.\nHow is it? You can laugh?

ID=210054511
However, if it is so messed up, is it fresh? Ha ha ha.

ID=210054512
We have to find a near soul worker ... but there is no information or way.\nThat means you can not help me.

ID=210054513
The situation is a situation. We have to go and see each other.\nI have one young woman later. You may as well say hello.

ID=210054514
Lieutenant Amanda. A wonderful chest ... No, have a heart.\nThe heart is in the heart, the heart in the chest. A wonderful chest ... Oh, I have a heart.

ID=210054515
Anyway, she is in charge of communication related here.\nIt would be better than to have a conversation with me.

ID=610054501
Well, see you.\nLet me know as soon as something new information comes in.

ID=310054501
You should go to Lord Colonel Amanda.\nThere are many things you know better than me. You should be able to send a reasonable amount of time.

ID=100545101
Oh, here!\nI thought that it was about time to come.

ID=100545102
You are a soul worker dispatched from Grace City, are not you?\nI saw it in the photo so I knew the face, but it is really a child.

ID=100545103
Wow, what is this skin ... it is not a crane!\nUh, I still have much more ....

ID=100545104
Oh, I did not introduce myself yet. I am Amanda.\nInterlude who is in charge of communication with Ruin Fortress.\nAbility is extension of radio waves. Well ... Is it a radio wave expander that moves easily?

ID=100545105
I am not proud but you might be the most competent among those who were sent here.\nBecause I can not communicate without me. Okho!

ID=100545106
Here Ruin Fortress is the fortress made by Ned Company.\nSince I refused contact with external powers including Stary Forest Alliance forever,\nIt was an unknown state.

ID=100545107
But that incident at Grace City ... by betrayal of Ned,\nNow that the alliance relationship on the top side has been resolved, it is no longer necessary to arrange the appearance as a coalition.

ID=100545108
It seems that shuttle, which seems to be carrying a near soul worker, came here,\nThe task is to investigate Ruin Fortress and keep track of near soul workers.

ID=100545109
Well, as this is the place to enter for the first time as a coalition,\nThe size of the facility and the onboard technology, unknown for anything.

ID=100545110
At the end of the funeral, the gathered members are the only ones who meet for the first time.\nIt can not be said that flattery is a good situation.

ID=100545111
That's why my role in communication is very important.\nNow I'm scanning the interior using a communicator, so maybe it will cost you a convocation after a while?

ID=100545112
Until then wait a moment. With rush and entering the facility,\nEven if you do not know the high-tech weapons you do not understand?

ID=100545113
Well ... although it's hard to crush the time like this though.\nOh, that's right! Since I have a person Dr. Sarah, I suggest you go.

ID=100545114
I do not know well, but it seems to be the most authoritative in Crow Dream in energy related ne.\nI think that it was probably dispatched to locate the power source of Ruin Fortress or the working principle ....

ID=100545115
It is hard to talk to me.\n... Are you smart people with authority or doctorate?

ID=100545116
Anyway, I am busy so ask him for an opponent Dr. Sarah.\nI will call you as soon as I get some work done ... Do not go too far?

ID=100545117
Oh, by the way, that keinbarel who came together.\nIs he also a soul worker?

ID=100545118
Wow ... look at that arm. Is not that thick?\nWould you get angry if you told me to touch it only once?

ID=100545201
Are you new to rumors?\nI have heard stories from Senior and Sedurin.

ID=100545202
It seems they are talking with various people from a while ago,\nWas there something interesting information too?

ID=100545203
... There is not it. Of course.\nI am also known as energy-related authority for the time being, but I do not understand it at all.

ID=100545204
I wonder what purpose the facility of such scale was built for what purpose,\nThere is no way to know what technology is being used inside, now.

ID=100545205
From the material of the floor here, to the scale of the internal facilities.\nThere is nothing clearer.

ID=100545206
Near soul workers in places full of such uncertainties ....\nIt is a mindless composition to say that the gathered force is also a team ....

ID=100545207
With the facility itself completely stopped, even the energy wavelength can not be investigated ....\nIt is indeed a state of being ready.

ID=100545208
Well, when I told whining, the situation will not change.\nAnyway, we have to wait until there is some information.

ID=100545209
You should also take a short rest.\nNow I can only do it, and resting is also an important task.

ID=510054501
......

ID=410054501
... Do not talk.

ID=210055001
No matter how much it is an instant team, this is terrible.\nIt can not be argued if it is called a crowd of ravages ....

ID=210055002
What kind of members are you searching for near soul workers?\nHun, make you laugh.

ID=210055003
... But you can believe even this kind of crowd.\nAnyway, we have to wait right now.

ID=210055004
......

ID=210055005
... Well good.\nIn this emergency, you definitely will not spare time.

ID=210055006
......

ID=210055007
... HM.

ID=210055008
... noob. Do not stand standing there, so why do not you go off and go rest?\nYou can not stand calm just standing in front of me.

ID=210055009
Are you a newcomer?\nWe soul workers are less tired than ordinary people.

ID=210055010
If that comes to mind, you can live a normal life even for 2 hours of sleep.\nI am free from illness, and it is overwhelmingly advantageous when compared.

ID=210055011
That is why you must be careful about the state of mind.\nEven though it is a sturdy body, the former is a human being ....

ID=210055012
If my heart collapses, I will not use a sturdy body.\nThe best way to prevent the collapse of the heart ....

ID=210055013
It is to enjoy everyday life.\nYou can watch the outside of the window blankly, or you can take a walk somehow.

ID=210055014
It is one way to devote herself to her hobbies ....\nIt is quite easy to just era.

ID=210055015
Anyway, mental care is important.\nI guess I do not know what it is because I have noticed a newcomer.

ID=210055016
The danger of the collapse of the heart increases more rapidly than live.\nIt may sound bad, but this is a fact.

ID=210055017
So, if you can spare time at all, calm down your feelings.\nI wish I could live longer.

ID=210055018
If you understand, how about going somewhere not standing?\nPlease think about the importance of waiting time and act.

ID=210055019
I am sorry to disturb you during the break,\nExcuse me.

ID=210055020
... What is it for?

ID=210055021
You can grasp the whole facility of Ruin Fortress to some extent.\nThat is why I came to pick up two people.

ID=210055022
... Have you finished already?\nI could grasp it faster than I expected.

ID=210055023
We are also surprised.\nWell, shall we go?

ID=210055024
Here we go, newcomers.

ID=610055001
Mental care ... when there is time to go.

ID=310055001
It seems that some information was entered.\n... Let's do mental care later.

ID=100550101
I came. The situation will contend for a moment. I will start right away.\nDr. Sarah, may I ask for an explanation?

ID=100550102
Yes. Currently all the facilities of Ruin Fortress are working properly.\nI can not believe it was left unused for a long time.

ID=100550103
That's strange. When I went to the toilet earlier, the automatic door did not open.\nStill if the facility is operating normally?

ID=100550104
That's the problem. Even if the facility operates normally,\nThere is no way to access that control authority.

ID=100550105
Hmm ... Do you mean it is locked?

ID=100550106
so. Whether Ned Company locked out when leaving this facility,\nI do not know if lock will take place automatically after a certain period of time.

ID=100550107
Surely, since there is no control authority in Ruin Fortress,\nEven the toilet is in a state where it can not go freely.

ID=100550108
I see.\nIf it is open properly, what you did without having to sprinkle on the door at that time.

ID=100550109
... I will keep away from the boys' toilet.

ID=100550110
Anyway, first you need to gain control of Ruin Fortress.

ID=100550111
Is there any way?

ID=100550112
here we go?

ID=100550113
Is not it?

ID=100550114
My job is structural analysis of energy sources.\nFrom there onwards, are not you working?

ID=100550115
I see, it is true.\nAlright, Amanda.

ID=100550116
What?

ID=100550117
Did not you tell me something you understood somewhere?

ID=100550118
Oh ... yeah. It's about AI ....

ID=100550119
AI?

ID=100550120
The radio waves of this facility are beyond the level that the machine operates alone.\nThis is anticipated, but maybe there are AIs that summarize these?

ID=100550121
Hey, if you listen silently ....\nAI? Are not you reading too much SF novels?

ID=100550122
Well then, but ... is this facility a common thing of our common sense?\nIs it an unknown energy source for unknown substances?

ID=100550123
There is nothing wrong with AI.\nYou better develop your imagination.

ID=100550124
......

ID=100550125
Well then, Amanda.\nIs it possible to identify places that summarize radio wave operation?

ID=100550126
It has already been specified.\nThere is a suspicious place.

ID=100550127
Let's face it.

ID=100550128
I see. If you have an AI, you should control all the facilities of Ruin Fortress.\nIf you can secure even that AI it will make searching easier.

ID=100550129
It's a rule. Two of the soul workers.\nSearch for places that Amanda identified.

ID=100550130
... I will not go.\nI'm not so busy as to waste time.

ID=100550131
all right.\nThen, I have no choice but to ask the partner.

ID=100550132
It can be used more than Seoul workers who only have sightseeing in height and have no brain.\nYou can trust me for you. Ha ha ha.

ID=100550133
......

ID=100550134
Okay, I beg you.\nI can not go together ... Because my heart is always with you!

ID=100550135
The goal is AI search.\nShould I decide after securing whether I will be able to secure it?

ID=100550136
By the way, how to enter the search point?

ID=100550137
Should I destroy it?\nIt will be OK about once.

ID=510055001
It was a schedule for easy reconnaissance ....\nThere seems to be more harvest than I expected.

ID=410055001
Well ... let's try to organize the situation once.

ID=210055501
First of all ....\nAI exists reliably. Besides, it's pretty cute.

ID=210055502
Not at all ... I do not know who's doing it, but he has a nice taste.\nIf AI like that ... I can devote my life! !

ID=210055503
... Dangerous, this person.

ID=210055504
The second.\nNear soul worker, who is the search target, has already been wandering around inside the Ruin Fortress.

ID=210055505
There was nothing inside the shuttle that they were supposed to ride.\nBut it is clear that they are moving with some purpose.

ID=210055506
Do you know the purpose?

ID=210055507
I do not have any difficulty if I understand it.\nI do not know, so I am in trouble.\nOf course, I am not struggling.

ID=210055508
In short. Control of the facility is essential for searching for near soul workers,\nIn order to control it we need to secure AI.

ID=210055509
Also, in order to secure the AI, it is necessary to disable or reduce the ability.

ID=210055510
What's suddenly.

ID=210055511
It is a level AI that is illusioned that there is an ego.\nI do not know how to secure it?

ID=210055512
Huh ... hacking?

ID=210055513
... It is expected, but it is impossible to mobilize all the top hackers.\nProbably, the basic is no doubt that it is a quantum computer. Hologram program and engineer because it can visualize ....

ID=210055514
Amanda.\nSomething ... Can not hear a bonbon sound?

ID=210055515
Yeah, I can hear it ....\nMartin's head explodes, right?

ID=210055516
Oh, I can hear from you too.

ID=210055517
Oh, my head seems to have exploded. Giggle

ID=210055518
... Briefly, our technology is what AI like that Lucy can do,\nLet's pretty much format at least.

ID=210055519
format? how?

ID=210055520
It only has physical influence.\nAI like that, it can not be operated with one device.

ID=210055521
There are a lot of sub-cores to support power and operation.\nIf you physically break it ....

ID=210055522
___ ___ 0 What?

ID=210055523
... Because computing power and output are reduced, chances of hacking will be born.\nOf course, it would be difficult to secure all the control authority of the facility if that happens, but is it still sufficient?

ID=210055524
At least ... I will be able to go to the toilet.

ID=210055525
Will not the door be sacrificed?\nOK, if you decide so ....

ID=610055526
I will pass this time as well.

ID=610055527
That's probably right.\nWell, I have not expected.

ID=610055528
I was able to use it.\nsorry.

ID=610055529
no problem.\nEven without one person, I was convinced that I could do enough.

ID=610055530
......

ID=610055531
New, is it a little nice?

ID=310055501
Lucy begins a fool fight.

ID=100555101
I heard from Sedurin.\nIt seems that trouble has occurred in Grace City.

ID=100555102
It seems that the Rapid Flame guys are plotting the raid.\nAlthough it is a scale that can be sufficiently suppressed by Grace City's military force alone ....

ID=100555103
As you already know, this military loss is quite large due to the failure of a surprise attack.\nIt seems that Rapid Flame with an eye on it positively positions executive classes throughout.

ID=100555104
... I will go to support.\nYou must stay here and do your best to search for near soul workers.

ID=100555105
Well, what ... I can take it easy to leave you with those guys,\nI will manage the search anyway.

ID=100555106
Then, a near soul worker ....\nI think you know well if you fought before, but the difference in fighting force is not that big.

ID=100555107
You will win well even now.\nI will leave it to you. I'm begging you.

ID=100555108
... It was supposed to impose a troublesome task,\nThere is nothing beyond the situation like this.

ID=100555109
You proceed with the search.\nI will also depart as soon as I get ready.

ID=100555110
Good luck, new.

ID=100560101
Besides, there is a loud noise from the outside!\nMom and Dad, run away over there ...!

ID=100560102
Always ...! Suddenly quietly though a loud noise was getting on!\nWell then, alone in the dark!

ID=100560103
I ... alone. Always ... forever ... Uoo.

ID=100560104
(... seems not to be in a state where you can talk very much.

ID=100560201
... It is strange.

ID=100560202
Martin?\nWhat is strange.

ID=100560203
Do not you think it is strange?\nThere is only one child.

ID=100560204
There is only one child in this over-technology-rich facility.\nA form of rushing around as if waiting.\nDo not you think it is suspicious?

ID=100560205
... Is that child a near soul worker?

ID=100560206
... Biological response was 100% human.\nIs not it a little doubtful?

ID=100560207
Really? But it is true that it is questionable.\nI need to know the circumstances of the incident, but I do not intend to solve the doubt.

ID=100560208
The machine can not lie.\nThat girl is just a human. It is mediocre ... right?

ID=100560209
In that case ...\nHmm ... well, you'll know that.

ID=100560210
......

ID=100560211
Either way, the panic seems to have stabilized somewhat.\nWill you start a hearing a little?

ID=100560212
hearing?\nWhat are you talking to your kids?

ID=100560213
Whether it is a child or an adult, it is commonplace to investigate if in doubt.\nWe forgot that we are engaged in duties by betting our lives?

ID=100560214
You can not bet your life while holding anxiety factors.\nEven if it is a boy who stimulates your sister's maternal instinct.

ID=100560215
... Martin.\nHave you married?

ID=100560216
Does it seem like there?

ID=100560217
Well, I never brought up my child.\nThen you can understand that I can say such a thing.

ID=100560218
Such a girl?

ID=100560219
Eight brothers.

ID=100560220
... It will be too much.

ID=100560221
Can you stop counting things according to your standards?\nFrom me I am anxious about the fact that there are no brothers.

ID=100560222
Anyway, I will proceed with this case.\nMartin can not be trusted.

ID=100560223
I can not hope.\nJust like you like.

ID=100560224
What are you going to do with such a young child?\nThat one is more dubious.

ID=100560225
That boy ....\nSuddenly saying "You can touch your sister's chest?" Is funny. Hahaha.

ID=100560226
... My brain is rotten.

ID=510056001
Yahoo, I am Amanda.\nWhat's your name?

ID=510056002
A, Abel ....

ID=510056003
It's called Abel.\nTouch your heart?

ID=510056004
Huh? ... Huh?

ID=510056005
Hello?\nAmanda-chan? What's wrong?

ID=510056006
...... Ha!\nBecause you just said weird stuff I've become strange to me!

ID=510056007
Well, it's my fault ...!

ID=510056008
Whew.

ID=210056501
......

ID=210056502
Oh, sorry about a while ago?\nWe also flapped and said strange things.

ID=210056503
Oh ... it's okay.

ID=210056504
Heh. You are solid.\nI will ask you various questions from now, can you answer me?

ID=210056505
Um ... ... what are your older sisters?

ID=210056506
Oh, I was careless. I did not even introduce myself.

ID=210056507
We are soldiers belonging to the Star Forest Alliance.\nI came here to catch a rogue.

ID=210056508
It happened to discover you on the way.\nIt's not bad people, so it's okay if you do not have to.

ID=210056509
Yup ....

ID=210056510
Wow ... I'm good at cheating children.

ID=210056511
Do not mind what that uncle says.\nWell, can you tell me why you were alone in that?

ID=210056512
... I was sleeping.\nBut suddenly there was a loud noise and the room shook ....

ID=210056513
Mom and dad came running and put me over there.\nIt's so dangerous that you never get out if you go out.

ID=210056514
Before Mom or Dad call me, definitely go out and say the door ....\nOutside was all the more noisy, I heard the sound that something broke and the sound of exploding all the time.

ID=210056515
... People ... screaming too.

ID=210056516
......

ID=210056517
Then suddenly the sound ceased to be heard.\nMe ... I was so scared ... I was waiting forever ....

ID=210056518
So, I heard people 's voice from the outside, so go out and ... you guys.

ID=210056519
... How long have you been trapped?

ID=210056520
I do not know. How much is it?\nI think I ate half of the food we had.

ID=210056521
Perhaps, it has been there for more than a month.\nYou are too beautiful when you ....

ID=210056522
There were some clothes inside ....

ID=210056523
Coincidentally even a child's clothes?\nWell, let's suppose that. No wonder the toilet was inside too?

ID=210056524
Oh ... yeah.\nHow did you understand?

ID=210056525
Ha ha ha!\nSo why was there no TV and gaming machine?

ID=210056526
Martin! What are you doing! What?

ID=210056527
Interrogation?

ID=210056528
I told you I will do it here.\nDo not bother.

ID=210056529
Yes it is.

ID=210056530
Abel. Can you tell me why you are here?

ID=210056531
Papa was a researcher here.\nIt was a whole person from facility development to design, all my family lived here.

ID=210056532
Hmm? Mr. Abel.\nDo not you know how to trim Lucy?

ID=210056533
Martin! Such a thing for such a child ...!

ID=210056534
Oh, Lucy is about central control AI, right?\nBut what does it mean to roll it up ....

ID=210056535
... Huh?

ID=210056536
Look, see. You can not lick a recent child.\nI know everything.

ID=210056537
... Well, I see.

ID=210056538
Abel. We have to investigate here for certain circumstances,\nIt is a little troubled by the disturbance of the AI ​​called Lucy.

ID=210056539
I want to make Lucy on our side,\nIs there a good way to do it?

ID=210056540
Well ... in essence Lucy can not investigate, right?\nThen I think you should delete Lucy.

ID=210056541
...?\nDelete?

ID=210056542
Yeah, Lucy is A.I for facility control in case there are no people ... so ....\nOnce I deleted it, I asked Dad that I could control it manually.

ID=210056543
... I see.\nWhen Lucy is gone, it just becomes impossible to control facilities.

ID=210056544
I was desperate enough to get it anyway.

ID=210056545
No way, just delete it.

ID=210056546
That's right. It was useless pain.

ID=210056547
let's go.

ID=210056548
Yup. Let's delete it.

ID=610056501
Please take this.\nIt is a device for deletion. Originally it was created to discard confidential matter at once.

ID=610056502
If you put this in any program,\nIt is just a garbage collector.

ID=610056503
This is punishment that caused useless hardship.\nPunishment for Lucy who wasted precious time!

ID=610056504
Punishment!

ID=610056505
... I just misunderstood.

ID=310056501
It turned out that facility control is possible even when Lucy is gone.\nLet 's delete Lucy without leaving the truth.

ID=510056501
Good morning.\nI got almost Ruin Fortress facility control authority.

ID=410056501
I was thinking about it in a while, problematic.

ID=210057001
I got control authority for sure.\nBut what is the problem?

ID=210057002
It means that the power to move the facility is insufficient.\nI have a car, but I do not have fuel ... I wonder if it is like it.

ID=210057003
In the current situation, I can only do simple operations.\nSo, I have to secure electric power somehow.

ID=210057004
It's easy to say, but what are you going to do?

ID=210057005
What are you going to do ...?\nRun Ruin Fortress's power source again.

ID=210057006
Power source?

ID=210057007
In order to operate such a facility of scale, there will be limits only from external power.\nSelf-sufficiency is one of the basic conditions of a fortress.

ID=210057008
So it is obvious that there is a power source inside the Ruin Fortress ....\nIt is not difficult to figure out the position.\nI've already confirmed where Energy is spewing.

ID=210057009
Hmm ... I said that I do not know anything and I am quite familiar with it.

ID=210057010
It's all speculation.\nThere is nothing like a sure thing.

ID=210057011
Ah, that ....

ID=210057012
How are you? Abel.\nIs there something new?

ID=210057013
of….\nI do not know if it is useful.

ID=210057014
What.

ID=210057015
I told you that the power source here uses "Buster Core".\nI do not know the principle well, but it is close to infinite power ....

ID=210057016
Buster core?\n... That is supposed to be theoretical.

ID=210057017
Ba, Buster Core Energy from Slave Core\nI said it was a device that converged and turned into electricity.\nSo, to use Buster Core you have to move from each slave core.

ID=210057018
"Each" slave core?\nIs not it one?

ID=210057019
Yup. I told you there are three slave cores in all.\nIt is possible to supply enough power by just moving one ... ....

ID=210057020
If you move two or more slave cores,\nThey can machine production internally.

ID=210057021
... Can you machine production voluntarily inside the facility?\nWith self-sufficient power source, you should be able to do that ....

ID=210057022
Although it pointed out that imagination is poor, it seems to be obsessed with theory?

ID=210057023
... That's right.\nThis place was not a place common sense would pass.

ID=210057024
Let's organize it once.\nIf you move the buster core, power is supplied to the Ruin Fortress.

ID=210057025
However, for that purpose three slave cores must be activated.\nDo you agree?

ID=210057026
No. That's correct.

ID=210057027
It's like a game.\nBombs are necessary to destroy the walls, swords are necessary to get the bombs,\nYou need a boomerang to get a sword ....

ID=210057028
Anyway ... What I have to do is clear.\nA considerable amount of time has passed since we arrived already, but we can not perform the character of search for it.

ID=210057029
It may be dangerous if it takes more time.\nI do not know where the near soul worker is doing.

ID=210057030
Well, hurry up.

ID=610057001
By the way Abel.\nStrangely familiar here?

ID=610057002
of….\nDad taught us a lot ....

ID=610057003
Hou ... why did you talk to a young child like that?\nThere is something to worry about.

ID=610057004
Do not you want to see Mom and Dad?\nWas it a story of forced separation away in a dangerous situation?

ID=610057005
Besides, you do not ask at all what happened here?\nI thought that I would naturally ask you ....

ID=610057006
......

ID=610057007
Hmm, I do not feel like answering ...?\nWell, in that case I do not mind.\nInstead, keep preparing to be suspected.

ID=310057001
Activate the slave core and the buster core will move.\nElectric power supply is essential if you can proceed with the search. Quickly.

ID=510057001
Thanks to the operation of the slave core, the power supply is done smoothly.\nBut another problem came up.

ID=410057001
Fu, I do not like being dispatched to places I do not know because it is this.

ID=210057501
There are three slave cores in all. Collect energy generated from the three in one place,\nThe device that converts to electricity is a buster core. You understand so far, do not you?

ID=210057502
However, it seems that something was necessary in the course of running Slave Core.\nWell ... For example, is it a card key more than executive class of Ned Company?

ID=210057503
Suddenly why such a thing?\nElectricity is supplied firmly, only afterwards you will search.

ID=210057504
I also activated the safety device.

ID=210057505
Safety device?

ID=210057506
Recognizing that the "non-authorized person" started up the slave core,\nThe other two slave cores began attacking the launched slave core.

ID=210057507
... Can you fight with Slave Core, too?

ID=210057508
For example if you say ...\nTwo slave cores are forcibly activated,\nI absorb the energy of the first slave core.

ID=210057509
If left unattended, the first slave core's energy runs out,\nThe supply of electricity to Ruin Fortress, it will become a fleeting dream and disappear.

ID=210057510
what ...! So how?\nAbel, do not you know anything?

ID=210057511
Well, that is also me ....

ID=210057512
There is no other choice than to use Lucy suppression.

ID=210057513
Format?\n... It seems useless.

ID=210057514
... It's a physical influence.\nHow to destroy the remaining cores, except for the first slave core started.

ID=210057515
I see ... Punishment for a bad child robbing Energy.

ID=210057516
Something wrong, but that's what it is.\nElectricity is reduced by half, but energy that can be controlled can be secured.

ID=210057517
There seems to be no other way.

ID=210057518
It seems like that.\nLet's assume it will be destroyed. Slave core!

ID=610057501
Anyway, Dr. Sarah is surprising.

ID=610057502
... What about?

ID=610057503
I think whether to solve technically as an energy related authority,\nEven at the time of Lucy I tried to solve it by force.

ID=610057504
Oh, is power part of energy?

ID=610057505
... very much! !

ID=310057501
The purpose of this time is to destroy cores other than the activated slave core.\nIf it's too late, everything will be in vain. Now, hurry up.

ID=510057501
... I confirmed the suspension of the slave core.\nThanks to the power of Ruin Fortress. You can not go searching.

ID=510057502
Two things happened here while you were doing your duty.

ID=510057503
One thing is that Amanda is now showering.\nAnother thing is that Abel is gone.

ID=410057501
No way, went to look into the shower ...?

ID=210058001
Dr. Sarah. Did you grab Abel's whereabouts?

ID=210058002
Yes. Catching a life reaction in a place with main power.\n... Buster core location.

ID=210058003
Do not get doubtful.\nSuddenly the boy who appeared suddenly disappears ....

ID=210058004
Still doubting?

ID=210058005
of course.\nFrom the beginning I had a dubious smell puffy.

ID=210058006
... It might just be a curious child?\nI do not think you can see it with such a lens.

ID=210058007
There is no such thing.\nJust a child suddenly appears in such a place?\nWhy are you familiar with facilities?

ID=210058008
Moreover, as soon as securing the power source, I headed to Buster Core.\nIf you do not think this is strange, you are crazy.

ID=210058009
... But I have to search.

ID=210058010
Of course.\nI always do a search.

ID=210058011
Then I asked.\nTow the buster core.

ID=610058001
... I have to find out the true intention of Abel.

ID=310058001
Let's find Abel.\nI have to listen what you mean ....

ID=510058001
To Welcome party original.

ID=510058002
Do not look at me with such eyes.\nDid you understand it already? Who am I ...?

ID=510058003
It is one of the near soul workers to be searched ....

ID=210058501
... Anyway, there are many people who love to have fun ~?\nLike Martin, a stranger must doubt first.

ID=210058502
But, it is true that things have progressed easier thanks to you.\nIt would be bad if you are in that position.\nOnce in a while I can tell you, thank you. To

ID=210058503
I will go to Buster Core.\nOf course, what is the purpose is a secret ....

ID=210058504
But, are you going to chase me again?\nWell then, see you ~.

ID=510058501
......

ID=510058502
......

ID=410058501
Did not you tell?\nHe will be a near soul worker ....

ID=210059001
... I admit that I handled it easily.\nBut Martin, you can not even talk about people?

ID=210059002
What does it mean?

ID=210059003
If you are convinced that it is a near soul worker,\nYou should have dealt with it accordingly?

ID=210059004
Were they enough?

ID=210059005
...?\nOh, alright, is that questioning?

ID=210059006
That's it. Although I was convinced Abel was a near soul worker,\nHis purpose was unknown.

ID=210059007
According to reports there are at least three nearby soul workers.\nWhere I caught one of them, there would be no point in it.

ID=210059008
The purpose is unknown, but it is necessary and wandering around us.\nInstead of doing one thing they want, it is cheap if you know the purpose.

ID=210059009
Well, what are you planning to do now?

ID=210059010
Even if asked only by me, I am in trouble.\nThese people will be smarter than I am.

ID=210059011
No, you ... not a temporary commander here.

ID=210059012
... Oh, I've been wanting to throw it out.\nIt's tracking anyway. Keep track of and see where you came to such a fort for purpose.

ID=210059013
When you find out what?

ID=210059014
If we benefit, we will not prevent it if it does not exist.\nOf course?

ID=210059015
... I got it.\nBut, Abel has absorbed most of Energy of Buster Core\nYou can not control the facility perfectly.

ID=210059016
Clearly, I can only control easily.\nIn the end, you just have to run around and find out one by one.

ID=210059017
Then I will be fine.\nBecause there are soul workers who run a lot.

ID=210059018
... Huh. Just to be sure, Ensterie of Buster Core in Amanda\nI told you to figure out the route you moved.

ID=210059019
As Abel absorbed Buster Core energy,\nIf you follow that reaction, you know where you headed.

ID=610059001
Go to Amanda.\nBecause the results should already have come out.

ID=310059001
Go to Amanda.\nThe result of Energy 's movement route should have come out.

ID=100590101
Happy, Huck!\nOh, sorry.

ID=100590102
Fu ... ... the hot water suddenly came out during the shower ....\nBecause I was in shampoo, I could not help it, after all it was cold water ... Hacksun!

ID=100590103
Gusu ...!\nOh, I wonder if you punished me for showering while at work.

ID=100590104
That's why Abel was a near soul worker ....\nI could not see such a bad girl.

ID=100590105
Well, everyone has circumstances.\nIn our circumstances, we track Abel ... that's it.

ID=100590106
Energy response of Buster Core ....\nIn other words, the size of energy absorbed by Abel is huge.\nI do not hide it, I guess it is inviting me to the contrary.

ID=100590107
If it is a guidance, I'd be a little worried ... but it can not be helped.\nBecause we have only one choice.

ID=100590108
From the shuttle traveling path inside the Ruin Fortress,\nCatch the Energy reaction absorbed by Abel.\nScanning inside the building is impossible. I have no choice but to go directly.

ID=100590109
I will transfer the location to the operation device.\nSince the entrance is also open, just enter it.

ID=100590110
Anyway, this place is strange.\nThere is a shuttle traveling path inside ... How wide is it?

ID=510059001
Ha ha ha!\nIt was completely useless. Thanks for your hard work.

ID=510059002
... Hey, is that the line to say to those who struggled?

ID=510059003
No, that's not it.\nI thought that I was depressed. I thought I would make the mood excitement.

ID=510059004
Is that so?

ID=510059005
of course.\nOkay, please Amida chan ridicule.

ID=510059006
Hahaha! I like that useless so much! What?

ID=510059007
Ha ha ha! I like this useless bone!

ID=410059001
... I'm sorry.\nI apologize instead.

ID=210059501
It is as long as you are in a hard time that you do not have good news as a profitable tongue with bone fracture ....\nNow, we are thinking of entering with a different route.

ID=210059502
I hope to be able to pinpoint the migration route of the near soul worker,\nIt is impossible for Amanda to have such a skill.

ID=210059503
Hey, did you do so far in such a bad situation?\nI would like a little comfort.

ID=210059504
sorry. The true heart has just appeared.

ID=210059505
... Well, I apologized and I'll forgive you this time.

ID=210059506
... No, be angry with your true heart.

ID=210059507
Anyway, let's go by a different route this time.\nI am praying here. I hope this time it will not be useless.

ID=610059501
... It seems to be a useless neurosis.

ID=310059501
Well, let's go survive this time and go with useless.

ID=510059501
......

ID=510059502
Is it the first time to see a person?\nWhat is so unusual?

ID=210060001
Gowong. How long are you going to see it?\nIs it attitude towards a senior man who is standing still?

ID=210060002
Oh ... my legs.\nI was tired from walking. Can not be helped, I will go to your garrison for the time being.

ID=610060001
Is there warm cocoa?

ID=310060001
... What happened?\nTake me to your garrison quickly.

ID=100600101
......

ID=100600102
......

ID=100600103
......

ID=100600104
......

ID=100600105
... Name is?

ID=100600106
Hicks.

ID=100600107
What is your occupation?

ID=100600108
Ask Dr. Sarah there.

ID=100600109
... Dr. Sarah.\nThis old man. what's that?

ID=100600110
... Doctor of Ned Company.\nA person who can be said to be authority on biotechnology and related to Seoul junk.

ID=100600111
Authority? Dr. Sarah.\nDo not underestimate me. Can you say that is the leading figure?

ID=100600112
... Well, as it is a fact, I do not feel like replying.\nThat's right. Dr. Hicks can be said to be the foremost person in that field.

ID=100600113
Hmm.

ID=100600114
What is such a great grandfather here?\nWhy did you surrender as adults without resistance?

ID=100600115
surrender? You should use words properly.\nI came here with my own feet. I do not remember throwing you.

ID=100600116
... then, what are you doing here?

ID=100600117
Both legs and waist hurts. I just came because I have no energy to walk.

ID=100600118
... Go home.

ID=100600119
Whoopee! ... Did you say something now?

ID=100600120
The old man. Doctor of Ned Company is suddenly coming to the garrison of the Union\nThere should be reasonable reasons.\nWhy are you asking why?

ID=100600121
He is a chatty guy.\nTo tell you, I am single. She will not be there, too? It seems not to be popular.

ID=100600122
A lie ...? How did you understand ...! What?\nYou ... no way Esper ...! What? It is Esper! !

ID=100600123
... Somehow I thought so.

ID=100600124
... I can not afford to talk about such a bullshit.\nNow answer!

ID=100600125
It is a bit chilly, but the weather is fine today.\nCan you get a cup of hot cocoa?

ID=100600126
Let's continue the search.\nPerhaps this time you should see the end of the shuttle path.

ID=100600127
Is not cocoa still? Cocoa is here.

ID=100600128
Looking at the absence of movement in the energy reaction absorbed by Abel, there seems to be some plan.

ID=100600129
Cocoa ~ Cocoa still not?

ID=100600130
Please think that it is the final search of the shuttle traveling route and enter again.

ID=100600131
cocoa. cocoa.

ID=100600132
... Amanda.\nI have a request.

ID=100600133
What?

ID=100600134
Let me feel a little silent there.

ID=100600135
......

ID=510060001
A new near soul worker appeared again.\n... How many people are there? Is not it 20 people or something?

ID=410060001
They are the only ones.\nLaban, Abel, Noah, Enoch ... are the only children completed as near soul workers.

ID=410060002
Grandpa, you know something after all?

ID=410060003
Of course. Otherwise it will not come to such a place.

ID=410060004
Then let 's talk about what you know.

ID=410060005
You're a prisoner. Without making any effort, are you going to want only results?

ID=410060006
If you do not want to say, return home.

ID=410060007
Well, wait.\nI will talk about it. Of that.

ID=410060008
Among them? When is it?

ID=410060009
... well.\nWell, it will not be far.

ID=210060501
Leave such old grandfather,\nShall we arrange the situation?

ID=210060502
Energy reaction was out of the shuttle traveling path.\nPerhaps, I entered a big door behind the shuttle traveling route.

ID=210060503
I do not know what it is ... there is it?

ID=210060504
I do not seem to ask you directly.

ID=210060505
A big door ...?\nNo way ....

ID=210060506
The old man. Is there something in mind as well?

ID=210060507
......

ID=210060508
No reply.\nI wonder if I will finally get out.

ID=210060509
I am disrespectful! This young woman!

ID=210060510
Haa ... anyway, please do this again.

ID=610060501
I understand that the mission in an uncertain situation is serious.\nBut, there is only you. Good luck with a little more.

ID=310060501
Go to the other side of the door.\nEnergy reaction is heading there.

ID=510060501
Armory full of prohibited weapons ....\nUntil LXT ... I can not touch my hands.

ID=510060502
Wait a minute.\nThe energy reaction stopped moving.

ID=510060503
Stopped?

ID=510060504
I do not move from one place.\nYou are trying to do something with that energy.

ID=510060505
... old man?

ID=510060506
Dunno.

ID=510060507
You do not know anything.\nAnd that being doctor, is Ned's doctor status automatically issued if it is old?

ID=510060508
Well, young man.

ID=510060509
Hmm, old people.

ID=510060510
... They are all at the same level.

ID=510060511
Huh? Does that include me too?

ID=510060512
... I wonder?

ID=410060501
No, no, it 's absolutely included too!

ID=410060502
Fuu ... My head hurts.

ID=210061001
Well, if there is no movement in energy coordinates it is now a chance.\nLet's see what you are going to do.

ID=610061001
Currently Busaster Core Energy is a level for a big city.\nI do not know where I plan to use such energy, but it is certainly dangerous.

ID=610061002
You are such a facility.\nTo be honest, no matter what may come out.

ID=610061003
Just prepare your mind so that it will not move even if anything comes out.\nWell, the world is not going as you expected.

ID=610061004
Well, it does not have to be said.

ID=310061001
There seems to be no movement in energy coordinates.\nTake me to the arsenal once more.

ID=510061001
So, what do you want to say?

ID=510061002
That much energy.\nIt can not be a simple thing.

ID=510061003
I do not know your circumstances and the reasons to hide it so far,\nIf you leave it as it is, it will be hard.

ID=510061004
For example, what happens? Take an example.

ID=510061005
... More than half of the crow dream west eradicate.\nWhen converting Energy of that scale into a simple explosion ....

ID=510061006
......

ID=510061007
If we make it weapons we can also create beam weapons that will blow the edge of the crow dream west.\nAbout one city can be blown lightly.

ID=510061008
So we stop.\nBut at least I have to figure out what is the purpose.

ID=510061009
......

ID=510061010
You seem to keep silent.\nThat's good. As you like.

ID=510061011
We will pin down. Instead, the probability of being too late will go up.\nYou only have to track who you do not understand.

ID=510061012
If it fails and many people are injured ....\nI will not forgive you. Take responsibility whatever you use.

ID=510061013
... Give me some time to think.

ID=410061001
...... It is scary somewhat.

ID=410061002
What Sara said is right.\nRather it is not enough.

ID=410061003
For personal reasons, I will not give any information to this important and dangerous thing.\nEven if you punch one shot you will not be punished.

ID=210061501
Did you feel like talking for a while?

ID=210061502
......

ID=210061503
... It seems useless.\nlet's go. Stop the near soul worker.

ID=610061501
... I do not even know what I have to stop.

ID=310061501
......

ID=510061501
... Abel ....

ID=510061502
The old man. Can you explain it sooner or later?\nWhat is that Abel said "can we meet soon"?

ID=510061503
That is ....

ID=510061504
Hmm ... I still need time to think about?

ID=410061501
... I can not wait for bad.

ID=210062001
Well, will you talk to me somewhat?\nThe purpose of the near soul worker and that huge "ARE" thing. Besides, it means "I can meet."

ID=210062002
I do not talk.

ID=210062003
Cutting ... It is an interesting joke.\nAre not you going to say it really?

ID=210062004
......

ID=210062005
... It is no longer possible.\nFrom now, change the tracking and securing strategy of near soul workers.

ID=210062006
The objective is to "subdue Near soul workers."\nYou can do anything from corpses and neck. End it.

ID=210062007
Become\nDo you know what kind of girls they are!

ID=210062008
You probably will not know. Or maybe the old man tells us?

ID=210062009
......

ID=210062010
There seems to be no mind to speak as ever.\nThe old man, listen well.

ID=210062011
Even though I do not even say my own idea,\nIt is cowardly to put into trouble every time with later.

ID=210062012
What do you want me to do?\nIs tracking stopped? Or withdraw?

ID=210062013
There is room to consider stopping pursuit for some reasons.\nI can not confirm whether I can do it.

ID=210062014
But, the old man. You are abandoning it even now.\nIt is a simple bystander.

ID=210062015
And yet, do you know what kind of girls they are?

ID=210062016
I do not know. To be honest, I do not want to know.\nThose who know it do not teach anything, there is nothing to know, too?

ID=210062017
Be an onlooker like a bystander.\nDo not put in trouble whatever we do.

ID=210062018
......

ID=210062019
... Do not say anything yet.\nThen, we do what we have to do.

ID=210062020
What we do with near soul workers,\nLike watching silently like a bystander.

ID=210062021
......

ID=210062022
... Stubborn geezy.

ID=210062023
......

ID=210062024
At that time when this matter settled down to some extent ... speak all.\nLet's face down first.

ID=210062025
under?

ID=210062026
That huge power source you guys call Buster Core ....\nActually it is not a substitute that can be called a power source.

ID=210062027
Such a thing is just a filter device.

ID=210062028
Is it a filter device?\nWhat on earth are you talking about ...?

ID=210062029
There is a power source called a deep core in the basement of Ruin Fortress.\nThe amount of spurting energy was too big and needed a filter to hold it down.

ID=210062030
That made it ... Buster Core?

ID=210062031
That's it.

ID=210062032
Impossible ....\nEven energy generated from Buster Core has already gone away.

ID=210062033
Is that the level that came out through the filter?\nIt is a common story that can not be done. There is no such energy.

ID=210062034
Dr. Sarah. Are you familiar with LXT?

ID=210062035
......

ID=210062036
You do not seem to know. No one can explain clearly about LXT.\nThat is the same for me.

ID=210062037
Do not get caught in common sense.\nThose are "something" far beyond our common sense.

ID=210062038
I understand what you are talking about, why do you need to head to the basement?

ID=210062039
The code name "Deus · A · Makina" was originally made as a weapon for Soul worker.\nIt had the role of absorbing the energy which the soul worker spews out with the core.

ID=210062040
The function to absorb soul energy was completed, but we could not produce the body that supports it.\nWhen Seoul energy exceeding a certain amount is absorbed by the core, the body is messed up.

ID=210062041
However, the core itself remained filled with Soul Energy.

ID=210062042
So?

ID=210062043
Underground deep core can not be started unless it is a soul worker.\nThat is because all the executives of the Ned Company were Seoul workers.

ID=210062044
... What did you say?

ID=210062045
Abel used Seoul Energy condensed in the core of Deus · A · Makina,\nI am planning to unlock and start deep core security.

ID=210062046
About Ned Company executive information, you can easily hack.\nAbel was a girl in the limelight as a genius hacker.

ID=210062047
However, that unique source of energy that the soul worker spews can not be hacked.\nSo I used you guys.

ID=210062048
So, why did you absorb energy from Buster Core?

ID=210062049
Energy absorbed from the buster core will be used to start Deus Ex Makina.

ID=210062050
And after absorbing Soul Energy in the core of Deus · A · Makina,\nI am going to launch a deep core.

ID=210062051
Why deep core?

ID=210062052
... The story has become long.\nno time. hurry up.

ID=210062053
Hey, hey hey! In an important place ...!

ID=210062054
promise.\nI will tell you everything when this is over.

ID=210062055
... Chit. It is my best friend.\nI understood. Let's enter.

ID=610062001
I display the position. It is necessary to get off to a considerably deep position.\nhurry up. If you do not make it in time, it will be irreparable.

ID=310062001
Let's get down to the basement for the moment.\nI can not do such a bad job forever.

ID=510062001
Did you go back?\nIt seems that the route has secured to some extent.

ID=410062001
However, it is still far.\nI need to get off for a while.

ID=210062501
The underground of Ruin Fortress is dug deeper than you guys think.\nBy the way, we have not gone down yet.

ID=210062502
... No joke, old man.\nLet's spend so much time, is it still half?

ID=210062503
That's it.

ID=210062504
I see.\nIt seems,%username%.

ID=210062505
I have not gone half way yet, get down quickly.\nGet off and get down to the bottom.

ID=210062506
... A little nuance.

ID=210062507
However, there seems to be certain existence of the huge motive power Dr. Hicks said.\nThe more you go to the basement, the stronger the signal is.

ID=210062508
Unusual signal .... After all, the identity of energy sensed when first arriving at Ruin Fortress was\nIt seems that it was a deep core. Unique wavelength that I have never seen or heard before.

ID=210062509
Tomorrow, the path is correct.\nContinue to get off.

ID=610062501
Please be patient more.

ID=310062501
hurry up. We must prevent deep core activation.

ID=510062501
... Did the deep core move?

ID=410062501
Abel ... Are you really planning on doing it?

ID=210063001
In this way, there is no choice but to forcefully stop the deep core.\nThat's the only way to stop the deep core that has already started.

ID=210063002
How can I stop it?

ID=210063003
Physically destroy.

ID=210063004
... I see.

ID=210063005
... Two doctor who is famous for Crow Dream,\nWhen it comes to emergency, do not hit it and break it.

ID=210063006
Sometimes it is better to be simple.

ID=210063007
But is it such a size that you can hit to break it?\nAs far as I hear the story, deep core seems to be quite big.

ID=210063008
It is quite big ... but it should break.\nIt's like a soul worker.

ID=210063009
After break, what after that?\nIf it is a movie, it explodes at the end and escape in the meantime.

ID=210063010
Such a thing does not happen.\nDeep core energy evaporates in the air in a flash.

ID=210063011
It is important to keep it in mind so that it can be used as an energy form\nThe role of deep core. Therefore, if you destroy the equipment, you can solve it all.

ID=210063012
Alright. Let's go to the last one.\nIt seems that there is no single thing that can take time.

ID=610063001
Ahh. We must prevent it.\nIf the deep core starts up, there will be hard work.

ID=610063002
They should desperately resist it.\nPrepare for battle.

ID=310063001
There is no other way than breaking the deep core.\nhurry up. It will be too late.

ID=510063001
Amanda, did you know the cause of the vibration?

ID=510063002
Yes, I understand.\nBut ....

ID=510063003
...?

ID=510063004
Is this vibration of the engine?

ID=510063005
... Amanda.\nIt's not time to make a joke.

ID=510063006
No, not a joke but a vibration pattern ....

ID=410063001
... truly?

ID=410063002
... Really.

ID=210063501
Is the ground shaking due to engine vibration?\nNo matter how much it is not it.

ID=210063502
Is it also a super huge robot?\nWell, in this situation whatever comes out is not amusing.

ID=210063503
Is not it earlier to ask Dr. Hicks?

ID=210063504
That's right. There is a lot of things I'd like to hear.\nLet's go to the grandfather.

ID=610063501
... This time, I must listen to the truth.

ID=310063501
Let's go to Dr. Hicks.

ID=100635101
Everyone seems to have got it.\n... I was organizing my thoughts.

ID=100635102
I used to tell that children ... Near soul workers had talked about a few in all?

ID=100635103
Yes. Laban, Noah, Enoch, Abel. I told you I was four people in all.

ID=100635104
... I have another one.

ID=100635105
What did you say?

ID=100635106
I told you there was one more person.

ID=100635107
......\nWell, no doubt the grandfather! ... Is it a near soul worker?

ID=100635108
... Alright.

ID=100635109
Near soul workers have not been made many from the beginning.\nBeginning ... I needed a prototype.

ID=100635110
Near soul worker prototype ... the first near soul worker.\nThat is "Zion". That child was made here.

ID=100635111
Prototype ....\nWell then, it was that Abel said "I can meet soon ...".

ID=100635112
That's it.

ID=100635113
Hmm ... I understood the story, is that something wrong?

ID=100635114
What is the problem?

ID=100635115
Is it such a bad thing to see that prototype?\nWhy does the grandfather need to be nervous so far?

ID=100635116
Even grandfather, you keep watching until now you should know well?\nNear soul workers can not be an overwhelming threat.

ID=100635117
It's a level you can do anything.\nNevertheless, why are you sticking to that?

ID=100635118
... Only Zion is special.\nThere is a dimension of strength.

ID=100635119
Do you know why Ruin Fortress was abandoned?\nIt is because the reckless Zion massacred all members of Ruin Fortress.

ID=100635120
......

ID=100635121
All human beings who were close to 500 ... ....\nIt took less than 20 minutes.

ID=100635122
... What did you say?

ID=100635123
At that time, there was also a squadron class competitor,\nIn front of Zion, Akiko is no better.

ID=100635124
We put all weapons for soul workers studied by Ned Company,\nI barely succeeded in suppressing Zion, but if the same thing happens next time there will be no way to prevent it.

ID=100635125
Therefore, as a measure of the hardship, I dug a hole deep under the Ruin Fortress,\nI sealed Zion there.

ID=100635126
That's why people are gone from Ruin Fortress.\nPeople are all asleep, and in the basement they are sleeping until a monster.

ID=100635127
Try to think. Do you think that it is possible for Ned Company that does not have much money to abandon this facility?\nThere is a reason for everything.

ID=100635128
Then, Abel ... Are you trying to revive its prototype?

ID=100635129
That's it.\nAbel ... I think Zion is his mother.

ID=100635130
Such a thing is not important.\nWhat matters is the relationship between restoring the prototype and deep core.

ID=100635131
There is a huge excavating machine to start with energy of deep core.\nThe name is "Dig Monster".

ID=100635132
With just seven Digg monsters, we built the terrain where Ruin Fortress can be built in one month.\nAs the word is, it is a monster digging the ground.

ID=100635133
There is no such efficient machine to dig the ground.\nThe problem is that the power consumption is intense. It would be even harder to start without deep core level power.

ID=100635134
Well then ... the previous vibrations really belonged to the engine.

ID=100635135
... I will not be surprised anymore.

ID=100635136
In other words. If you leave that digg monster and other machines, there is a danger of digging prototypes.\nSo, it will be tough for him to resurrect. It's quite strong.

ID=100635137
That's it.

ID=100635138
Hmm ... I wish I had talked sooner.

ID=100635139
Wherever I talked, nothing has changed.

ID=100635140
My mood changes.

ID=100635141
Let's head there anyhow.\nThe destination is where the prototype is buried.

ID=100635142
Originally it was a place studying military equipment inside Ruin Fortress.\nShow the place. hurry up.

ID=100635143


ID=100635144
Are you ready for it?

ID=100635145
Yup. This Dig Monster ... I've been neglected for quite a while so it will not move properly, but I can fix it soon.

ID=100635146
Huh, if you fix it you can see Zion?

ID=100635147
Probably ... no, absolutely.\nI can meet soon.

ID=100635148
......

ID=100635149
What happened? Enoch.

ID=100635150
... Disagreeable. Nothing.

ID=100635151
Shall I speak for you?\nWhat Enoch can not say.

ID=100635152
... No, what it is.

ID=100635153
Even if that Zion wakes up, it means that you may not remember Abel.

ID=100635154
......\nNoah. I felt sooooooo, but I was sharp in vain.

ID=100635155
Cheek. This is a gap moe.

ID=100635156
... As Noah says.\nAbel. Even if Zion woke up, what if you did not remember it?

ID=100635157
I can not do that.

ID=100635158
No, that's okay.\nIt covers for about a year, but how much does it matter to face it?

ID=100635159
That is also pretty young.

ID=100635160
Do you think you remember it?\nEven so in the years, but what are you saying at that time ... what to say ... Well ....

ID=100635161
It was a little shabby.

ID=100635162
so. Sho ... Cha! I did not have that much ....

ID=100635163
Anyway, that what you said at that time was not a type that remained so impressive.\nCan not be convinced? I suppose Zion remembers it.

ID=100635164
... I am really worried.

ID=100635165
......

ID=100635166
......

ID=100635167
But ... even so ...!

ID=100635168
... all right.\nStill want to meet once, do not you?

ID=100635169
... Yup.

ID=100635170
It can not be helped.\nMy sister works hard in order to make the youngest child's unrequest love.

ID=100635171
Or, it is not unrequited love!\nI ... I just want to see you.

ID=100635172
... There is no child who has never said selfishness.\nI will only listen if you say so far.

ID=100635173
I agree.\nBut Abel. Please promise only one.

ID=100635174
... Yup. What?

ID=100635175
Even if Zion does not remember Abel ....\nPlease do not hurt.

ID=100635176
... all right. I promise.

ID=100635177


ID=510063501
Dig Digs started to move!\nThe output rises ... Apparently it seems that it started in earnest!

ID=410063502
no time.\nI will pace more.

ID=210064001
Digg monster's output is rising!\nWait a moment ...! This is the critical point ...!

ID=210064002
Do you want to tell me not to ...?

ID=210064003
Although it is only an anticipation ....

ID=210064004
... Let's hurry.

ID=610064001
... There is no limit to having no critical point.\nI can not waste a minute or a second.

ID=310064001
Quickly!\nThe output is steadily rising!

ID=510064001
......

ID=410064001
... It is over.\nZion awoke ....

ID=210064501
It is already over.

ID=210064502
not yet.\nThe prototype has not woken up yet.

ID=210064503
The numerical value of the characteristic wavelength emitted from the prototype is too weak.\nThere is no sign of growing.

ID=210064504
I can manage to do something before waking up.

ID=210064505
... What will you do if you wake up?

ID=210064506
I think at that time.\nNow I have no choice but to do.

ID=210064507
... you guys seem to have a bad turnaround.

ID=210064508
I do not know if it took a long ago like an old man,\nUnfortunately we are still young.

ID=210064509
......

ID=210064510
Amanda. What is the location of the prototype's unique wavelength?

ID=210064511
It seems to be recovering. It is fixed in one place and it will not move.

ID=210064512
I will secure a prototype.\nLater things ... let's think about afterwards.

ID=610064501
... There is no choice but to hope that it will not be too late.

ID=310064501
... Sion ... Abel ....

ID=510064501
To take time is that you still have time.

ID=410064501
... It seems that the end is approaching.\nWe or that of those children ....

ID=210065001
Did you catch the reaction of Zion?

ID=210065002
Ruin Fortress outline.\nThere is no change in the amount of energy.

ID=210065003
Outline ....\nWhere is "arc" made?

ID=210065004
There is something I want to make clear before entering.

ID=210065005
What?

ID=210065006
Grandpa, why did you come here?\nTake Ned's soldier.

ID=210065007
......

ID=210065008
I know that near soul workers are made of Ned.\nHowever, it seems not well thought.

ID=210065009
You can see it even when you see the state of armedness when you met.\nAt least not for protection purposes.

ID=210065010
... Boy, in vain to be a sharp guy.

ID=210065011
... Did you come and go?

ID=210065012
... That's it.

ID=210065013
... After all?\nWhy? Is it because it is dangerous?

ID=210065014
... Ahh. That girl ... It is not a level that Ned Company can control any more.\nMy ego has grown too much.

ID=210065015
Laban has succeeded in suppressing that ego. However, the source of the power of soul workers is mind.\nThat is why Laban 's fighting power was low.

ID=210065016
It is not necessary if you can not control it where you made it difficult.\nNed Company is such a company.

ID=210065017
... Really., The old man seems to be different.

ID=210065018
......

ID=210065019
The old man does not feel like I came to death.\nAs far as I can see.

ID=210065020
......\nFuu ....

ID=210065021
The project "Ark" was a project to build ordinary humans into seoul workers class intercourse.\nAs you do know, soul workers and experts can not be made artificially.

ID=210065022
It is not a joke,\nSoul workers are created by God.

ID=210065023
But human beings aim for God.\nMe too ... it was.

ID=210065024
Ned Company has been interested in strengthening humans from long ago.\nNaturally, it is to grab the hegemony of the world.

ID=210065025
A soul worker basically having a heart of "good" does not match with Ned Company. ... There are some exceptions.\nTherefore, Ned Company always felt something like inferiority to the Stary Forest Alliance.

ID=210065026
Therefore, the Ned Company independently tried to secure sex workers and soul workers.\nTo suppress the starry forest coalition and to reign as ourselves as the king of the world.

ID=210065027
I do not seem to think anything about human experiments.

ID=210065028
... That's right. He repeated experiments called inhumanity. However, I could not get any results after all.

ID=210065029
When human beings imitate God, it is something that a rough end is awaiting.\nThe project "Ark" was one of them.

ID=210065030
Repeating a number of failures, only the mountains of corpses were piled up.\nIt was such a thing. The Ned Company began to look at all-purpose substances.

ID=210065031
... Vacuum Bain ...! What?

ID=210065032
That substance constituting soul junk. It can fuse with any thing, besides soul workers\nIt can not be extinguished. I watched the infinite possibilities of such a versatile substance.

ID=210065033
The failure factors of the experiments that have been done so far were obvious.\nIt is a point that an ordinary human being can not bear the enormous energy of the soul worker.

ID=210065034
You should imagine balloons.\nWhat if you put more air than necessary into the balloon?

ID=210065035
... Burst.

ID=210065036
That's it. So use the vacuum vane to forcibly ruin the bursting balloon ...\nIt was the purpose of the experiment.

ID=210065037
Vacuum Vane basically can not fuse with Seoul Energy though it may know.\nTherefore, we needed "something" to temporarily remove Seoul Energy from the human body.

ID=210065038
... That's why I used anti-soul.

ID=210065039
That's right. Do not leave Seoul Energy on the human body using Anti Seoul,\nVacuum vein was fused.

ID=210065040
Then, Soul Energy is injected again before the soul junking progresses.\nDoing so will result in a form in which Seoul Energy is inside the vacuum vane.

ID=210065041
But, Vacuum Vane and Seoul Energy can not coexist.\nAs Dr. said earlier.

ID=210065042
... so. You are right.

ID=210065043
......

ID=210065044
We relied on miracles.

ID=210065045
... miracle?

ID=210065046
... Hey, old man.\nNo way ....

ID=210065047
... I tried and stabilized that method to many people.

ID=210065048
Do not be silly!\nI thought that the human life was going to arise! ! !

ID=210065049
......

ID=210065050
... The human being tested was mainly children aged 15 to 18.

ID=210065051
... What ... what ....

ID=210065052
Soul workers and experts embody feelings as power.\nIn other words, the most empathetic period ... Young children ... ....

ID=210065053
......

ID=210065054
... The experiment repeatedly failed.\nBut a miracle happened.

ID=210065055
A successful case occurred.\nThat is ... Zion.

ID=210065056
Zion's power was amazing. That power that overwhelms even the soul workers was more than I expected.\nBut I could not control it.

ID=210065057
The spirit has broken.\nTherefore Sion is ....

ID=210065058
......

ID=210065059
Ned Company said that Zion was a successful work and failed work.\nSo I started making a second near soul worker based on Zion's data.

ID=210065060
That's Laban, Enoch, Noah, Abel.

ID=210065061
It can be said that it is the second generation near soul worker.\nBut, of course, there was a problem. The completion of Zion was a miracle.

ID=210065062
I can not expect a miracle again.\nTherefore, we began to actively introduce data on existing soul workers.

ID=210065063
...%username%. That girls were made based on your data.\nStrangely, there was no refusal response. The experiment was stable.

ID=210065064
... So call me the original.

ID=210065065
... back to the topic.\nThe reason why Jake and me came here is to put off those children.

ID=210065066
Jake and I are responsible for Near Soul Worker Development Headquarters,\nI know how to deal with them surely.

ID=210065067
(Hicks took out a small remote control from his bosom silently)

ID=210065068
If this button is pushed, the vacuum vane present in the body of the near soul worker ramps up.\nIn other words, Soul Energy and Vacuum Bain begin to fight.

ID=210065069
... The impact of the human body can not bear.

ID=210065070
... How about using it quickly?

ID=210065071
... I intended to do so.\nBut, I knew it together with you.

ID=210065072
... The children ... have undesirable power ....\nIt is mediocre ... normal children ....

ID=210065073
... I want to save you.\nFrom dirty fate ... those kids.

ID=210065074
... I guess you could do it if you guys.\nBesides, there is still a chance.

ID=210065075
But ... only Zion is another. That girl is a real monster.\nIf Zion wakes up ....

ID=210065076
......

ID=210065077
Without hesitation ... press this button.

ID=210065078
I understand you are obsessive, saying such a thing soon.\nHowever, please. Please save those children ... Please.

ID=610065001
Fuu, chest poorly is too bad and anti-emesis does not come out.\nI will do it without being told.

ID=610065002
It's not about adults doing fighting to get rid of their children.

ID=610065003
Ah. Sorry ....

ID=610065004
... It suddenly became worse.

ID=610065005
Go to the construction site where "Arc" is made.\nSo ... end it.

ID=310065001
Head to the construction site.\nIt's close at the end. I do not know what will happen ....

ID=510065001
Did you go back? Do not be afraid to hear what a spaceship is.

ID=510065002
Um ... Martin.

ID=510065003
Well, I am tired of being surprised at such a thing now.\nLet's quickly secure a near soul worker and let's get out of here.

ID=510065004
Just ... Martin?

ID=510065005
As the old man says, the end is close too.\nIt is a bit more patience. It is too persistent that it should be deflocculated!

ID=510065006
Martin!

ID=510065007
... What is it from a while ago?\nWill not it rise even with zipper on the back?

ID=510065008
That ... Dr. Hicks ....

ID=510065009
Doctor?

ID=510065010
... I went to the arc ship.

ID=410065001
... what?

ID=210065501
... Please explain the details.\nWhat was that old man?

ID=210065502
As soon as I told I found a way to enter the arc - ship ....\nI ran as it was.

ID=210065503
......

ID=210065504


ID=210065505
Did you say Amanda?

ID=210065506
... that's right. What's wrong?

ID=210065507
What is the route to the inside of the arc - ship?

ID=210065508
... inside the arc ship?\nWhy did you suddenly say?

ID=210065509
I want to see them ... directly.

ID=210065510
......

ID=210065511
I am the one who did terrible things to children.\nI can not impress everything on you guys.

ID=210065512
Hey, I do not eat a year in vain. It means that we can never be bystanders forever.

ID=210065513
......

ID=210065514
I want to see them directly.\nMeet me ... I want to apologize.

ID=210065515
... Hicks, you might die?

ID=210065516
I am informed.\nNow, tell me the route.

ID=210065517
... I can not let such information flow to civilians.\nHowever, there may be cases where you can see information from the display there in the space I have not seen.

ID=210065518
... Sorry.

ID=210065519
......

ID=210065520


ID=210065521
... Why did not stop.

ID=210065522
......

ID=210065523
I am asking why!

ID=210065524
Why should I stop!

ID=210065525
That old man will die! Before meeting a near soul worker, it is killed by an unmanned robot!

ID=210065526
I was saying that I do not mind if I die!\nBecause I said so on my own!

ID=210065527
... fuck!\nWhere is such a human being!

ID=210065528
I do not know why so much to protect Dr. Hicks,\nThat man ... It is not like you were doing a human experiment!

ID=210065529
Any innocent people ... regardless of adults or children ...!

ID=210065530
So you do not have to die ...?

ID=210065531
Do you even think that if you die you will change something!

ID=210065532
That's right! A human who did such a terrible thing ... It is natural to die!

ID=210065533
Stupid things ...!\nWait a minute, when it dies it is over! I can not even compensate my sins!

ID=210065534
A human being must live! You should compensate for your sins while regretting the remaining rest of your life!\nTo end it like this ...!

ID=210065535
... I agree.\nWhat Doctor Hicks has done is never permissible.

ID=210065536
That is why he should live.\nYou should live and spend the rest of your life for the victims and their families.

ID=210065537
He wants an atonement.\nBut that's a mean act that Dr. Hicks himself wants to get easy.

ID=210065538
If you truly compensate for your sins, it is meaningless unless you live.

ID=210065539
......

ID=210065540
I understand.\nLet's rescue Dr. Hicks.

ID=210065541
... to live and compensate for our sins.

ID=610065501
I will hurry!

ID=310065501
That Ahodjiji ...!

ID=100655301
... Fuu, I'm glad.\nApparently, the story is ... I can ... it is ....

ID=100655302
Receive this ... ....

ID=100655303
(Hicks took out the remote control)

ID=100655304
... I hope there is no chance to use this.\nBut ... Zion ... it is really dangerous .... George, Geh!

ID=100655305
Huh, huh ....

ID=100655306
... Sorry.

ID=100655307
Because of a foolish adult like me ... you guys will carry a lot of things.\nYou do not have to forgive me.

ID=100655308
But ... they have no sin.\nI was played with the human hand like me ... poor children.

ID=100655309
Nevertheless ... they remain straightforward ....\nNobody hurt ... I am searching for my way of life.

ID=100655310
... If I meet those children ....\nThere is something I want you to tell.

ID=100655311
... Like other children ... an ordinary life ... and so on.

ID=100655312
Do not encounter adults like myself ... mediocre ....

ID=100655313
......

ID=100655314
Ticket ....\nThe man named Hicks ... he is a terrible human being ....

ID=100655315
Until the end of the end ... to impose on others ....\nThere is no way I can save ... sitting ... person ... ....

ID=100655316
......

ID=100655317
(... seems to take my breath)

ID=100655318
(Let's go back ...)

ID=510065501
......

ID=410065502
Ahojijiji ...!

ID=210066001
(Passing remote control to Martin)

ID=210066002
... Remote control to kill Near Soul workers ...?

ID=210066003
(Martin dropped the remote control on the floor and trampled all his power)

ID=210066004
... Let's take it home.

ID=210066005
Near soul workers.\nTake me home and let them live as an ordinary child.

ID=210066006
Do not choose means or methods, make it live like a human being.

ID=210066007
It is a child who has been soiled with adult 's own convenience. Let's clean up our hands even if they are dirty.

ID=210066008
... What are you going to do with prototypes like Zion?

ID=210066009
... to seal again.\nUntil a solution is found.

ID=210066010
... That's right.\nI got it.

ID=210066011
let's go. It is the last finish.

ID=610066001
......

ID=610066002
Amanda. It is not so depressed.

ID=610066003
... But ....\nIf I had not taught that route ... ....

ID=610066004
... No one will blame Amanda.\nEveryone will surely do that.

ID=610066005
I and Martin ... are adults who ask reasons. That is why she got angry at that time.\nBut as a feeling it is the same as Amanda.

ID=610066006
......

ID=610066007
Whatever the outcome in the path he chose, he should have accepted it.\nDr. Hicks' death is not your fault.

ID=610066008
... So raise your face.

ID=610066009
... Yup. Thank you.

ID=610066010


ID=610066011
... Abel. Hix's grandchild ....

ID=610066012
... Yup. I know.

ID=610066013
Finally, I wanted to see just the face ....

ID=610066014
... Yup. That old man, as it was, made it better for us.

ID=610066015
......

ID=610066016
......

ID=610066017
... Zion still does not seem to get up?

ID=610066018
Yeah ... yet.

ID=610066019
After all, is there a limit in us?\nI need some expert help ....

ID=610066020
I can not do that.\nI will wake it whatever it is.

ID=610066021
... I see. But, Abel ....

ID=610066022
I know. The original comes, do not you?

ID=610066023
... and ... and.

ID=610066024
Ned company mercenaries are also entering, right?\nI know that.

ID=610066025
... Noah and Enoch earn time against Ned. You can not fight absolutely.\nBecause I can stop the original.

ID=610066026
Are you? Impossible. How to say 5 minutes.

ID=610066027
Even if the two of us now jump to the original at the same time, they do not have as much as five minutes. right?

ID=610066028
......

ID=610066029
......

ID=610066030
Body condition should not be bad. It is only natural that you can not do that much.\nSo do not think about fighting Ned. You only have to earn money for a reasonable time.

ID=610066031
... Abel. What if Zion did not wake up to the very end?

ID=610066032
......

ID=610066033
Such a thing ... There is not it.\nI'm sure to wake up.

ID=310066001
It is the last finish.\nLet's take those kids ... back home.

ID=510066001
... What happened?

ID=510066002
... It was being monitored until Zion suffered.\nBut suddenly all electronic equipment was squatting.

ID=510066003
... Then after a while Sion's figure disappeared, you came back here without scratches.\nWhat on earth happened?

ID=510066004
Where are the children?\nWhy did Zion disappear suddenly?

ID=410066001
... Say something.

ID=410066002


ID=410066003
... Hmm?

ID=410066004
...?\nWhat happened to Kane? I suddenly become vague.

ID=410066005
... Disagreeable.\nNothing. Suddenly I feel strange.

ID=410066006
Well ....\nSoul workers' intuition ...?

ID=410066007
I do not understand well.\nIt's just a strange feeling.

ID=410066008
Ho ... it's a strange feeling ...?

ID=410066009
... Commander. Please refrain from such a vulgar reaction in such a place.\nIt is an important place as it is.

ID=410066010
Oh! Well ... Shall I continue with the story?\nFirst of all, I have to ask you why you came here yourself.

ID=410066011
... Vesi.

ID=410066012
......

ID=410066013


ID=410066014
"Chapter 4: Tremoring Fallen Blades"\nComplete.

ID=410066015


ID=260105001
Oh, hey ....

ID=260105002
Are you able to come from Grace City?

ID=260105003
I'm Senseon belonging to the Western Forces 'Force Strike' unit.\nThere are various things and now the responsibility of the troops ... No, led ...? Anyway, I am with you.

ID=260105004
Our duties are in the places we have opened up by people like you\nWe are planning to organize large-scale equipment loading routes and conduct additional investigations.

ID=260105005
Well, it's not that much work ....\nOops, I did not call it to do such a story.

ID=260105006
(Senseon was suddenly looking around and started talking in a loud voice)

ID=260105007
That ... I called you because I was asked a little.

ID=260105008
Even though I met him for the first time, I am 100 years old to be rude to ask such a request.\nBut I can not think of any way to solve this situation ....

ID=260105009
Huh? Try talking about it for the moment?\n... I understand.

ID=260105010
Gowong ...! Actually, I have a fiancé.\nI have not made any proposals yet, but I love each other. More than anyone.

ID=260105011
The name is Aina. A · · · Na.\nIs not it a cute sound?

ID=260105012
Huh? You want to see a face?\nOf course I can not show it.

ID=260105013
Means of looking at the face ... no more.\nWow ... It is gone!

ID=260105014
A foolish picture of my favorite Aina!\nI'm sorry. I usually do not get tears so much, but ... this time only ....

ID=260105015
(Senseon cried for a while, worried around and wiped away tears)

ID=260105016
Fuu, what I want to ask you is a photo of Aina.

ID=260105017
I do not think too much about Aina,\nI used to carry Aina 's photos all the time instead.\nBut during the search strategy of near soul workers ...!

ID=260105018
Chased by yellow and black striped robots ....\nI remember where I ran away in crazy.

ID=260105019
Finally go out outside ... I can not find it! Anywhere!\nAina's picture ...! All my collections!

ID=260105020
How ... how I am stupid!\nOh ... ah ah ...!

ID=260105021
(Shengn had been flattened for a while, but somehow returned to me)

ID=260105022
That ... that is, how do you manage to find that picture?

ID=260105023
ask! Oh ... I run from him ... desperately ....\nActually I'd like to go looking for photos.

ID=260105024
I'm not confident of going over there and going back alive.\nEspecially now that there are no pictures of Aina. Because for me the goddess of luck is Aina.

ID=260105025
So, I beg you! Will you lend me your strength? What?\nBe sure to do ... be sure!

ID=660105001
Thank you! Thank you very much!

ID=360105001
He was a yellow and black striped guy.\nI used to have it before I was chased by him.\nI bet he's got a picture!

ID=560105001
I found it? Is it already? All

ID=460105001
(I handed out the pictures I found)

ID=460105002
Aina's picture ...! It's real!\nI thought that it was useless ...!\nThank you! Thank you very much!

ID=460105003
What a wonderful person you!\nFrom now on I will call you a professional!

ID=460105004
Thank you very much! Capability person!

ID=260105501
Hey, hey! The ability person there!

ID=260105502
Hahaha! Is there a little time?

ID=260105503
Actually, I have another request ...

ID=260105504
Recently, it seems that power supply to Ruin Fortress has not been made.\nActually I am worried about being that ....

ID=260105505
Something?\nWell, I mean the union.

ID=260105506
I think that it is a terrible organization.\nYeah, after all it is a terrible organization ... huh!\nWrong! I do not want to say something like that!

ID=260105507
Fuu ... That's right.\nYou know? It's about Aina.

ID=260105508
Because I survived luckily here and there since I belonged to the coalition.\nIt will be placed in the office where he always fell away from his hometown.

ID=260105509
Even though I wanted to defend my hometown and joined it ... Because it is a relatively peaceful place,\nEven if I requested it, the upper part did not place me in my hometown.

ID=260105510
So, when you are off duty you have to go home and meet Aina.\nWe were always keeping in touch with HEMS.

ID=260105511
And the problem is from here.\nHEMS is running on a built-in private generator?\nTherefore, it can be used even here where we can not supply much power.

ID=260105512
However, even though private power generators are built-in,\nSomeday I will lose power ... so,\nThe upper part decided to limit the operation authority of HEMS.

ID=260105513
If HEMS stops working after exhausting its own electric power,\nIt will have a major impact on the strategy.

ID=260105514
Therefore, if the power supply in Ruin Fortress does not reach the normal value,\nWe do not deserve the private use permission of HEMS.

ID=260105515
There it is. I asked about strategy education time,\nThat ... ... "Siegproto" robot eats electricity inexhaustively.

ID=260105516
Stopping that guy will solve the power supply problem a bit?\nThen private use of HEMS may be allowed ....

ID=260105517
I wish I could move directly.\nYou see, you do not have this ability, do you?\nI will not be able to come back safely. So, that ... ....

ID=260105518
We will reward you!\nsomehow! Can not you ask! ! ! What?

ID=660105501
Kimi, you ... you are a good person!\nThank you!

ID=360105501
It seems that the robot "Siegplat" will eat a lot of electricity.\nIf you defeat him, the situation may be improved a little.

ID=560105501
Well, have you solved it already?

ID=460105501
It's amazing ... well in such a short time ...!

ID=460105502
After Loco Town, Canddusiti it was also a big success in Grace City ...!\nAfter all it was not a lie.

ID=460105503
... I think the real thing is different.

ID=460105504
Oops! This is not the case!\nI have to check the power soon!

ID=460105505
Thank you for listening to my request.\nYou see me again? Hahaha.

ID=260106001
(Senseon seems to be suffering a lot.\nLet's call out)

ID=260106002
Wow, that's it! Surprised ...!\nCapability person? Well, what happened?

ID=260106003
Huh? What is he suffering?\nAh ... no, nothing ....

ID=260106004
It's nothing.\nReally ... Anything ... wait, can you wait?

ID=260106005
If you think carefully, your affiliation is not my unit.\nIs it okay if I talk about it ...?

ID=260106006
Fu ... I may have talked about before, but I am lucky in vain.\nNo matter where I go, I live and always return.

ID=260106007
It seems that if it is said that it is a good thing,\nI have the ability and survived ....\nOnly luck ... survived with luck alone.

ID=260106008
But, I do not think so.\nI really survived luckily,

ID=260106009
It is a hero but I do not want to worry about anything.\nHuh

ID=260106010
The problem is that this did not end with rumors.\nDoes the upper classy also believe this rumor that is not rooted,\nI will leave the uncontrollable task to me.

ID=260106011
I alone can trust luck though ....\nI will be involved in troublesome tasks every time.

ID=260106012
I'm complaining that there is a lack of aptitude or ability ....\nMy colleagues thought that I managed something if I were to go ....

ID=260106013
Duties we received this time ... What do you think?\n"Secure shuttle travel route"!\nIt is impossible for such a unit alone to do that!

ID=260106014
How hard the robot is there ... I have no bloods.\nWell, it's natural because it's a robot ....

ID=260106015
Everyone is going to the other world. Everyone ....\nO me, too!

ID=260106016
(I tried to calm Senseon, but I already got into my world and was saying sorry)

ID=260106017
(Let's clean up the enemies in anticipation of Senson's mission area)

ID=660106001
Everyone is over. This time it's impossible really!\nAina ... what should I do ....

ID=360106001
Ensure shuttle travel path ...! What?\nEveryone will go to the other world ... It is over now ...!

ID=560106001
Of the ability person?

ID=560106002
Hahaha. No, absolutely ....\nI did not see it even though I thought of meeting like this again.

ID=460106001
mission ...? Well, that is strange .... What happened ...?\nWhen we arrived, already enemies are in a state of partial destruction.

ID=460106002
It is strange to think about anything.\nIt's as if someone came first and roared.

ID=460106003
Huh? I was glad that the mission was successful. Hahah!\nEven though I was worried so much, it was not easy to end.

ID=460106004
Is this because of luck?\nBut it was the first time that it was good until someone else's luck.

ID=460106005
... Maybe my luck is useful a little?

ID=460106006
Would you like to go?\nThank you for having trouble with me! Next is the number I listen to your troubles!

ID=260106501
Capability person. O, what should I do?

ID=260106502
It was a serious thing ....\nI can not cover it anymore! It is desperate! Wow! !

ID=260106503
Ha ha ... sorry, sorry. I was a little distraught.

ID=260106504
Fuu ... Why do you remember succeeding in securing the shuttle travel path last time?\nThat's why I got bigger expectations for me.

ID=260106505
The problem is that the task will become difficult in proportion to expectations!\nWow! Here ... What is this duty ...!

ID=260106506
It is supposed to be codename "Heavy Iron Worm"!

ID=260106507
I can not do it for a normal human like me.\nIt is not my opponent who is lucky. It is suicidal act to challenge him!

ID=260106508
What has happened? Captain!\nAre not you going to kill the centipede?

ID=260106509
Well, it is decided to go!\nI will return soon after I talk with the guests! It's waiting until then!

ID=260106510
I understand. Captain!\nOverthrow, Ironworm!

ID=260106511
However, Iron worm overthrowing ... ....

ID=260106512
(The soldiers cried out as they overwhelmed Iron Worm!

ID=260106513
...... Ha ha ha.

ID=260106514
...? Everyone in the unit will be floating!\nAs expected it is this time to go to the other world ...! I ...!

ID=260106515
(Senseon seems to be confused.\nLet's help secretly this time)

ID=660106501
The first hardship has left me!\nAina ... I want to return under you.

ID=360106501
Punish codename "Heavy Iron Worm" ...!\n... I'm crazy, the upper part is. It's crazy ...! Oh ....

ID=560106501
... Capability person, please be honest?

ID=560106502
You, are not you? You ... doing it, do not you?

ID=560106503
Mission of the shuttle traveling route. That ... ... you made it around and cleaned up, did not you?\nWhen we arrived, "Heavy Iron Worm" has already been destroyed ...!

ID=560106504
Last time as well ... and this time, I told you about the assignment.

ID=560106505
There is only you. Is it so?\nIt helped me.

ID=560106506
Fuu ... well, as expected.\nWas he the ability person?

ID=560106507
And, for the time being, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.\nBecause I was worried ... you helped me.

ID=560106508
But ....

ID=560106509
(Suddenly, I heard a voice shouting "hero" from here and there)

ID=560106510
Captain of the hero! This was it!\nSo what? Everyone is waiting!

ID=560106511
Oh, it's a hero!\nI am not like that ...!

ID=560106512
Again, what happened? On such a good day.\nPlease do not humble!

ID=560106513
That's not it. What is this thing ...!

ID=560106514
I started again! Captain's modesty mode!\nBecause you have a customer ... Is there a different man you can do? This this!

ID=560106515
That's right!\nEven though there are customers, it is noisy! Get back soon!

ID=560106516
(I went back while making a fuss whether my mission was over)

ID=560106517
......

ID=560106518
Everyone does not listen.\nI am not a "hero".\nI have no such ability ... I have to say so ...!

ID=560106519
... I really appreciate what you've done for me.\nBut ...!

ID=560106520
It is all right now no more.\nIf you continue to succeed in your duties even though you have no ability ....\nAnyway, it will be irreparable!

ID=560106521
(Saying that despairing Senseon is "ability to survive")

ID=560106522
Is it also capable of surviving? That's not right.\nJust having a luck of survival is not a capability ...!

ID=460106501
I'm sorry. I feel a little sick.\nThank you for your help, Mr. ability. See you.

ID=260107001
Umm ... Capability person ...?

ID=260107002
Hahah, that was a while ago.\nI am full as well ....

ID=260107003
I think I did a terrible thing.

ID=260107004
Whatever you say say thank you when you apologize ....\nActually there is one more request.

ID=260107005
Huh? Will you listen?\nWhat a heart is wide ...!

ID=260107006
Goong! That ....\nA, about Aina ... do you remember?

ID=260107007
We love each other,\nI told you I was not able to get married yet.

ID=260107008
Yeah yeah ... That's it. Whew ....\nOh! To Aina ... let's propose ... ...!

ID=260107009
After marrying Aina,\nThe upper part may also pay attention a little ... ....

ID=260107010
Listen to me that there are many people who are aiming for beautiful Aina.\nI can not let you wait any longer!

ID=260107011
Sorry.\nmy mother! This seems to be too excited.

ID=260107012
Well ... it's a bit small ears,\nHave you heard of Ruin Fortress's "Queen of Flower"?

ID=260107013
It has been rumored since a while ago.\nFlower Queen ... I guess it is a very splendid flower.\nHow beautiful ... I can not even imagine. Huh

ID=260107014
(I explained that 'Queen of Flower' is not a flower,\nSenseon who entered my world does not hear)

ID=260107015
If you give that flower, you surely will be impressed ...!\nThere is no doubt that the proposal is successful! that's true?

ID=260107016
So I consulted him.\nWill you take that "Queen of Flower"?

ID=660107001
("Queen of Flower" is not a flower,\nEven if I tell him that it is "Ikushido" of Noah it seems to be unnecessary.\nLet's manage the cause of the rumor)

ID=660107002
Thank you very much! !\nCapability people are really nice people!

ID=360107001
("Queen of Flower" is not a flower,\nEven if I tell him that it is "Ikushido" of Noah it seems to be unnecessary.\nLet's go find out the cause of the rumor)

ID=601070201
......

ID=601070202
I heard it .... What is "Queen of Flower"?\nIt is the name of the ability of "near soul worker" ....

ID=601070203
Besides, I heard that Queen of Flower was done ....\nWell, the other party would be you ....

ID=601070204
I also misunderstood "Queen of Flower" ....\nI also asked to pick you up ....\nEverything I am bad ....

ID=601070205
Further rumors spread as I'm looking for "Queen of Flowers"\nEven I am supposed to beat that "near soul worker" ....\nIt's all my responsibility ....

ID=601070206
But, is not it a little overkill?\nIt is supposed to beat up to "near soul worker"! What?\nI guess ... should it be better to run away ...?

ID=601070207
(When you try to encourage, ringtones will ring from Senseon's HEMS)

ID=601070208
HEMS ...? It's me!\nA, from Aina!

ID=601070209
(I went running without doing turning around Shengni.

ID=601070301
(Sneak into the screen that Sengn seems to devour)

ID=601070302
"To my beloved Senseon"

ID=601070303
"... I heard that it is a cold area.\nI am worried that I have not caught a cold because you are cold. "

ID=601070304
"... I often hear your story.\nHe raised many warts and survived in numerous battlefields ... "

ID=601070305
"How much were your sufferings and fears when you heard the news ...?\nEven though I just thought about it, my chest hurts.\nBut at the same time I felt once again your courage. "

ID=601070306
"... Senseon.\nYou always say yourself is incompetent,\nActually, I have a strong heart. I know it well. "

ID=601070307
"... until that day you come back.\nI sincerely pray for safety. "

ID=601070308
"From Aina who loves you ..."

ID=601070309
... Aina.

ID=601070310
(I got serendiped in thought and went back to the original place and chase it.)

ID=560107001
......

ID=560107002
... decided.

ID=560107003
I understood well about this time.\nAll causes were because I was not "real".\nThat's why I ... become "real".

ID=560107004
Until it becomes a real "able man"\nI absolutely will not propose to "Aina".

ID=560107005
Someday it will become "real"\nI will propose proudly in front of Aina! Wow!

ID=560107006
(While crying, Senseon ran for the sunset)

ID=460107001
(I feel better to be alone. Let's go home as it is)

ID=260107501
Oh, the proficient!\nWait a minute ... is it OK?

ID=260107502
I heard it with rumors ....\nDoes Ruin Fortress have illegal businesses specializing in "strengthening"?\nPerhaps ... do you not know anything?

ID=260107503
Huh? Why did you do that?\nWell, that ... I meet that person and speak directly!

ID=260107504
Tell me the reason ...?\nUmm ... Hmmm ...?

ID=260107505
I mean you know that! What?\nAs expected after all!\nI heard that the ability person and the illegal merchant are often connected!

ID=260107506
Huh, report? No! That's not it!\nThat, lend me your power ... I want you.

ID=260107507
I will talk more about it later.\nI swear not to inform you! promise!

ID=260107508
So, can you let me see that person?

ID=660107501
Thankfully!\nWell, let 's go!

ID=360107501
Where is the "hardening" expert?

ID=601075101
Ah! Members of the Star Forest Alliance!\nWow! ! I have to get away with ...!

ID=601075102
Oh, calm down! It is different! !\nOh, I'm a member of a coalition ... Oh no, it is a military person!\nI did not come to catch it!

ID=601075103
What? Really ... you came to catch it?\nThen, what do you want for me?

ID=601075104
Well, that is ....\nWell ... that ... ... that.

ID=601075105
What are you talking about? I can not hear it!\nAbsolutely ... If it is a man speak clearly!

ID=601075106
I was eager to become strong! !\nSpecializing illegal reinforcement ...! Mogo!

ID=601075107
(Trisha shouted Senseon's mouth shouting loudly)

ID=601075108
OK, OK.\nBut, it's illegal, but do not cry out loud.\nYou can hear it during Ruin Fortress!

ID=601075109
(Senseon is talking something bitternately)

ID=601075110
Hmm? Let me go?\nThen, do not give out loud?

ID=601075111
(Senseon desperately nods)

ID=601075112
Okay, then, do not tell me the matter.

ID=601075113
Bu, you! Good, breath ... ha ha!\nThat's right. Strongly ... I wanted to become strong.

ID=601075114
I want to be strong.\nDoes that mean you want to strengthen your weapons?

ID=601075115
That's not it.\nI am not a weapon, I want to become stronger.

ID=601075116
Uh ... well, my job is to hack and strengthen ....

ID=601075117
You can do it! What? What! What?\nHe is a master of hacking.\nYou should definitely be the best reinforcement craftsman! Become! What?

ID=601075118
Of course, of course! Is not it natural?\nIf you are strengthening, leave it to Mr. Trisha like a master of hacking!

ID=601075119
As expected a craftsman!\nWell then, what should I do?

ID=601075120
Er ... Oh, that's right.\nAfter all, you want physical strengthening, do not you?\nThen, why do not you try making armor with a hard material?

ID=601075121
Protector Hard material ...?\nAh ...! By the way, there was a guy who had something to use!

ID=601075122
Certainly ... "Dominia"! You have a hard shield.\nIf there is that, it seems to be usable for armor and weapons!

ID=601075123
Armor gear ... Good!\nIf you strengthen it to the limit you can become strong!

ID=601075124
Oh! As expected a craftsman ...!\nAh ... But how do you get the shield of Dominia?

ID=601075125
If so, surely a kind person will bring it. Is not it?

ID=601075126
Well, I see! That's it! (Flashing)

ID=601075127
(They hurt their eyes, they are seeds sown by themselves.

ID=601075128
I'm counting on you!

ID=560107501
Oh! Have you already gone?

ID=560107502
This is ... Is he a shield of something like that?\nOh, for a moment ... take it.

ID=560107503
Well ... OK! Hmm! A barel!\nHere, this ... heavy! Inoue Mouse!

ID=560107504
Hmm, it seems to be difficult to have it.\nAnd another problem ....

ID=560107505
Even the problem ...?

ID=560107506
There is no hackable circuit in this.\nThat means it can not be strengthened.\nIt is impossible for humans to use it.

ID=560107507
And that means ...!

ID=560107508
That's right! This means that it can only be used by a man named Dami.\nIn a word, it is a loser.

ID=560107509
Ha, losing! What? That's right! ! !

ID=460107501
(Trisha points to the despairing Senseon).\nI'm going to buy a grudge if I stay here. Let's run away)

ID=260108001
Ah! %username%!\nWill you give me a hand?

ID=260108002
I thought carefully with the reinforcement craftsman ....\nI told you something about true strength. So ...

ID=260108003
Oh, already! I'm tired!\nIn other words, if you say a strong person for us, you are what you are saying.\nBut you do not seem strong, do you?

ID=260108004
In other words, in terms of strength, spiritual things are more important than physical ones.\nThen, I did not make a fuss because he thought of something again.

ID=260108005
Well, if I say something ...!\nthat? Er ... What equipment is it ...?

ID=260108006
Oh, already! It's a link device!\nThere are two huge robots behind the internal laboratory.\nThey seem to always act in two bodies.

ID=260108007
It's almost like breathing is like a living thing.\nIt is a "link device" whose cause is built in.

ID=260108008
So, if you get hooked by getting either "link device"\nI thought that I could manipulate the other side.

ID=260108009
Operate a huge robot?\nIt gets stronger and it's super cool!

ID=260108010
Well, there!\nOf those two, please take "link device" from him "Heavy War Solver".\nI will definitely return this grace!

ID=260108011
It's a job that you brought.\nYou have responsibility till the end?

ID=660108001
Well, truly%username%!\nIt is reliable.

ID=660108002
I'm counting on you!

ID=360108001
With the guy "Heavy War solver" in the internal laboratory\nResonate "White guard"\nBring the "link device"! I asked.

ID=601080201
(I handed "link device" of "Heavy War Solver" to Trisha)

ID=601080202
Well ... this is not ring device ...?\nOkay, I will try out various things ~!

ID=601080203
(Trisha began to hack hilariously.\n, But Senseon next door does not float)

ID=601080204
Is it okay with such a way ...?\nAs hacking succeeded, could I be a suitable person for "hero" ...?

ID=601080205
(Senseon thought for a while, suddenly raised his face and shouted to Trisha)

ID=601080206
Wait a moment, please! Enhanced craftsman!

ID=601080207
I can do it a bit more, so quietly there ....

ID=601080208
quit.

ID=601080209
... Hmm? What did you say?

ID=601080210
And after all ... It will not stop strengthening in this way.\nmy mother. If I think about it, I feel like it does not suit me.

ID=601080211
What are you doing all of sudden?

ID=601080212
What ... somehow! I feel like it's a bit different!\nHahaha!\nAh! I remembered urgent business! Well, I will do this!

ID=601080213
(Senseon ran without running around)

ID=601080214
Gee ... What 's going on?\nDid you take so much time?

ID=601080215
(How are you feeling Sense is strange? Let's chase after)

ID=560108001
Oh, it seems I got back. Hahaha ....\nWe are sorry! Even though she made me meet with a hardened craftsman.

ID=560108002
What's wrong? I do not know.\nYou had the chance to become strong at last.

ID=560108003
......

ID=560108004
Actually, last time, I regretted with mail from Aina.\nSurvive only with luck, fearing being called "hero\

ID=560108005
To Aina who believes me to be "strong"\n"Yes, I will be strong so do not worry!"\nI could not give myself what I could not say.

ID=560108006
There is a lumpy "luck" so I will not make any effort.\nI was hoping for this "luck" unconsciously saying whatever I wanted.

ID=560108007
I wish I was ashamed of that 'luck' for that much.

ID=560108008
Even though I thought so until yesterday,\nWhen I tried to be really strong, I realized myself who also relied on that "luck".

ID=560108009
How can I become really strong ....\nWhat is strength? ...

ID=560108010
There is not really anything I can do with "luck" ....

ID=560108011
......

ID=460108001
Hahaha ...! Sorry. Also say a strange thing.\nBut thanks for listening.

ID=460108002
I am sorry for strengthening craftsmen, suddenly changed my mind ....\nPlease tell me that the rewards are done properly ....

ID=460108003
Well then ... well.

ID=260108501
How shall I do ....\nWhere have you been going ... this time!

ID=260108502
Even though it is an important thing ...! Where the hell ...!\nWell, maybe! What? Did you drop it then! What?

ID=260108503
... Who! I am busy now ...?\nCapability person? Oh, that's right!

ID=260108504
Wait, I want some help! It seems I lost the necklace ...!\nThat ... when I decided to go out with Aina, I gave each other a present.

ID=260108505
It seems I lost it somewhere ... I've been looking for it forever, but I can not find it.\nIf there is a mysterious lodge ....

ID=260108506
It's codenamed "Dreadbuster". Until getting away from him, there certainly was!

ID=260108507
It is not sure but ... it only comes to mind ...!

ID=260108508
Every time I do not have enough of such a request. ... ... you are already amazed ....\nBut you are the only one! ask!

ID=660108501
Will you listen?\nThank you! Thank you!

ID=360108501
There is a guy called codename "Dreadbuster".\nHe suddenly appeared on the scene and seemed to desperately dropped to run away.

ID=601085201
Welcome back!

ID=601085202
How was it? Is the necklace ...? warm?

ID=601085203
Was not there?\nSo ... you lost it?

ID=601085204
But, thank you for going out.\nNecklace ... will come out of that! Hahaha .... Huh

ID=601085205
What should I do ....

ID=601085206
(Senseon is still depressed, maybe I know something about the cleaning robot "Cleanie"\nLet's contact Cleanie with "HEMS")

ID=601085301
Thank you very much for using the high-speed transfer device HEMS.\nScan your customer's identification card.

ID=601085302
I confirmed "%username%".\nHello,%username%.

ID=601085303
(I sent a message saying "Search for gold rocket type necklace" to "Cleanie")

ID=601085304
Thank you for your use.

ID=601085401
(After a while, a reply came from "HEMS")

ID=601085402
Thank you very much for using the high-speed transfer device HEMS.\nScan your customer's identification card.

ID=601085403
I confirmed "%username%".\nHello,%username%.\nThere is one "Received mail". Are you sure?

ID=601085404
"[Sender: Cleanie] The case of lost gold rocket type necklace"

ID=601085405
"I have sent you a lost gold rocket type necklace and I will send it.\nWe sent you with "HEMS" high-speed transfer system, please check. "

ID=601085406
(I received a necklace with "HEMS" and I will deliver it to Senseon soon)

ID=560108501
Wow ... there is no face to meet Aina.\nI am an idiot to save!

ID=560108502
Spread ...! Ha ha! Well, what happened?\nNo, I am not crying! This is a runny ... ...!

ID=560108503
(He handed a necklace to Senson who stiffens while wiping his tears)

ID=560108504
What ... What! What? necklace?\nDid you find a necklace? Thank you! !

ID=460108501
......

ID=460108502
Th-This is ....

ID=460108503
It is not mine. This is ....\n... It is a friend.

ID=460108504
He died ... fellow.\n... At that time ....

ID=460108505
......

ID=460108506
... Sorry. Let me be a little alone.

ID=260109001
... You still have it?

ID=260109002
It is a face to want to hear the story.\nFuu ... I found this necklace ... and ....

ID=260109003
You are that soul worker.\nCan I speak to you?

ID=260109004
You ought to be surprised because the owner of this necklace was my friend and my colleagues said they were dead?\nBut ... it is a fact.

ID=260109005
Of course, they are not the people of the current team.\nIt is my fellows when I was first dispatched to Ruin Fortress.

ID=260109006
Did you say you can talk about "Soul worker" earlier?\nThat's ... because we were a team made to secure the security of soul workers.

ID=260109007
There are not so many soul workers remaining in the coalition.\nTherefore, desperately so as not to lose the remaining soul workers unnecessarily in the upper part.

ID=260109008
A representative measure is "I will start the first team in the area where the first rush in".\nIt is an unknown area and it is a protection measure to keep valuable financial resources from being lost.

ID=260109009
For that reason, the starting team sent to the area where you go for the first time,\nHe was made up of ability men who were slightly superior to ordinary people.

ID=260109010
We were one of them.\nA team made to gather information even a little before introducing soul workers into Ruin Fortress.

ID=260109011
I join the team because I have no ability but live from the battlefield each time returning home.\nI was the most incompetent in that team.

ID=260109012
But ... only me who was incompetent ... only I survived, all others died.\nAnd suddenly, I became "hero".

ID=260109013
Without ability I could not do anything on the spot.\nEven though one dead friend can not save it! Only one person survives a hero!

ID=260109014
......\nAnd everyone was forgotten.

ID=260109015
In the case of sacrifice without achievement, conversely in upper part it may treat secretly as reason to lower morale.\nPeople who felt deceitful will also sink for the reason that we must continue war.

ID=260109016
And you come here and solve the problem with taste, so even forget that such a thing happened.

ID=260109017
If a real hero appears,\nJust make the past just a story ....

ID=260109018
I even forget what they were sacrificed for.

ID=260109019
I also forgot about that because I am busy.\nIf you could not bring this necklace ....

ID=260109020
......! What?

ID=260109021
... Really. That's right, that's right! I had to find out more of these things.\nIt is now ... I feel I got now to know what I have to do.

ID=260109022
Fellow badge ... I have to find a badge.\nAnd ...!

ID=260109023
I will prove what they have done here ...!

ID=260109024
... code name "Earthquaker". Those people ...! They should have it.\nWhen everyone died, they gathered a lot ...!

ID=260109025
(Senseon seems to have decided strongly.\nHowever, since it is dangerous by one person, collect badges instead)

ID=660109001
(Senseon went searching by himself and had to collect badges in a hurry before anything happened)

ID=360109001
... code name "Earthquaker". Absolutely they should have a buddy 's badge ...!

ID=560109001
Hmm? What happened?

ID=560109002
What you want to pass to me? what?

ID=560109003
(I handed out the badge I gathered in Senseon)

ID=560109004
This is ...! You gathered me. A total of 30 pieces. Together with the five I found ....\nIt's perfect. All the members are now ready.

ID=560109005
Thank you ... really ... really.\nIf you were not there, it should have taken a considerable amount of time to collect this.

ID=560109006
... When I first talked about my friends ....\nI felt sorry to talk like what happened due to "soul worker".

ID=560109007
But I wanted you to know that you are sacrificing to protect you.\nI do not know how other people are, but you understood.

ID=560109008
Thank you for lending me the power to honor my friends in this way though it is not your responsibility.

ID=560109009
What will I do with this?\nOh ... in words it should be something embarrassing.

ID=560109010
I am planning to make a memorial monument.\nIn order not to forget them so that everyone will not forget them.

ID=460109001
I will invite you the very first time when done.\nThank you very much. No ... No,%username%.

ID=260109501
Oh ... one last thing left me again. No, two difficulties ... three difficulties ....\nLife is a series of unhappiness ....

ID=260109502
Why is it so dark?\nThat ... that is a memorial monument.

ID=260109503
I do not know the cause, but due to the suddenly generated huge wavelength,\nThe memorial monument which was under construction was completely destroyed.

ID=260109504
No matter how incompetent it is, I believe that luck is good only ....\nBut I can hardly believe it.

ID=260109505
I also lost the necklace with Aina, until the memorial monument ....\nEven luck ... to me ... Ayah.

ID=260109506
... Sorry. I can not speak any more.\nAlso contact.

ID=260109507
(Senseon seems to be considerably depressed)

ID=660109501
It seems necessary to lose a necklace that I lost.\nLet's ask Cleanie once more)

ID=360109501
(Let's ask Cleanie on HEMS about the whereabouts of the necklace that I lost once more)

ID=601095101
Thank you very much for using the high-speed transfer device HEMS.\nScan your customer's identification card.

ID=601095102
I confirmed "%username%".\nHello,%username%.

ID=601095103
("To Cleanie" "It was not what I was looking for before"\nI'd like you to search gold rocket-type necklace again "

ID=601095104
Thank you for using.

ID=601095201
(After a while, a reply came from "HEMS")

ID=601095202
Thank you very much for using the high-speed transfer device HEMS.\nScan your customer's identification card.

ID=601095203
I confirmed "%username%".\nHello,%username%.\nThere is one "Received mail". Are you sure?

ID=601095204
"【From: Cleanie】 RE: The case of lost gold rocket type necklace"

ID=601095205
"It seems that the thing we sent before was not the one you were looking for.\nUntil now, we have not secured other gold rocket type necklaces. "

ID=601095206
"I saw similar things in the construction facility near the area where the first near soul workers appeared,\nAt that time it could not be secured by the appearance of near soul workers. "

ID=601095207
"At present, construction facilities are banned from entering except for stakeholders,\nI think that it is good to search by the person concerned%username%. "

ID=601095208
"I hope that you can find what you are looking for"

ID=601095209
(It seems good to look for places where Zion appeared. Let's go quickly.)

ID=560109501
Uu ... well ...!

ID=560109502
(Tissue is handed over to sobbing soap)

ID=560109503
Oh, sorry.\nHmm? Well, what happened?

ID=560109504
Nee, no, I have not cried! Yawn yawning! Hahahah.

ID=560109505
So what happened?

ID=560109506
(Pass the lost necklace to Senseon)

ID=460109501
Here, this is ... my necklace!\nWhere did you find it?

ID=460109502
(I told you he found it in the area where the near soul worker appeared in the facility)

ID=460109503
I see, I see ...! Thank you! I do not know how many times you were helped.\nThank you very very much.

ID=460109504
(Senseon opened a golden rocket and saw the photo of Aina)

ID=460109505
... Aina.

ID=460109506
That's it. If you confess to Aina, you have to be firm.\nI can not despair because I collapsed once.

ID=460109507
......

ID=460109508
Hey,%username%.\nI have heard that you have only "luck" before I can tell you what I can do?

ID=460109509
I ... I feel I understood.\nWhat I can do with surviving luck ... I guess that's what it means "to survive".

ID=460109510
My memory is the testimony that the companion was alive here.\nAs long as I live, I can become a living witness of my colleagues.

ID=460109511
So I take care of my "luck" and go live.\nOf course, if I propose to Aina, I have to be a bit stronger.

ID=460109512
I have been taken care of so far. %username%.\nWhen I meet next time I will try my best to create a memorial mement of my friends.

ID=260110001
that! %username%! Long time no see!

ID=260110002
Why are you here?\nWell, if you do not have anything, who will strengthen your weapons?\nSuch a competent hacker, it is not so monkey?

ID=260110003
Besides that, I also want to see if the weapons strengthened by me are firmly demonstrating their power.\nOh, apparently it will not be long since strengthening last. Show me once ... Oh.

ID=260110004
Ah ... Well, now I can not strengthen.

ID=260110005
Hey ... you do know about the recent power shortage?

ID=260110006
Because of that, the coalition stationed at Ruin Fortress,\nIt was a policy to limit power except for the designated place.

ID=260110007
Well, if you hack it you can use it, but if you fail,\nThe relationship with the coalition is likely to get worse. So I said I'd refrain from using it.

ID=260110008
So ...%username%, can you help me for a moment?

ID=260110009
I happened to hear it, but he told me that "Heavy Sprinter X" in the central control room,\nIt seems that there is a built-in power generator.

ID=260110010
I've got it! Will you bring down the generator to defeat it?\nWith that, we will be able to use electricity regardless of the coalition.

ID=260110011
If you bring it, I will give you good things!

ID=660110001
Well then, be careful!

ID=360110001
what's up? No way, have you forgotten?\nIf you say something, it is physique!

ID=360110002
"Heavy Sprinter X" appearing in the central control room is stupid! And defeat it,\nI want you to bring a generator. Thanks!

ID=560110001
Welcome back. What is the generator? there were?

ID=460110001
Oh! As expected it is%username%. Haha!\nWith this you can use electricity comfortably.

ID=460110002
thank you.

ID=260110501
Good! Soul worker!\nLooks like he's been busy lately! Are you relaxing properly?

ID=260110502
Huh? I guess I will also be busy? Hehe, that's it!

ID=260110503
(Although he was laughing with self-confidence, he stopped suddenly and started to care about the surroundings)

ID=260110504
... Muu.

ID=260110505
(I take a breath as if I looked around a little and confirmed something)

ID=260110506
... Is it just me.\nOh ... I wonder if I am a neurosis? I am irritated.

ID=260110507
Well ... I should hit something.\nAh!

ID=260110508
That's right! Is that so!\nI have a soul worker!

ID=260110509
You know, Soul worker. Can I request one?\nOf course I will thank you.

ID=260110510
Do you decide after listening to the content?\nWell, I am surprisingly cautious in character.

ID=260110511
No, no, it's okay.\nIn this period, if you trade with an illegal merchant, it is necessary to be cautious about that.

ID=260110512
Actually, I am very tired recently.\nI mean the last alchemist?\nThat's why we are searching for the coalition.

ID=260110513
Well, I'm not so good as to capture those guys.\nRuin Fortress is difficult to move since detection sensors are installed in all directions.

ID=260110514
Moreover, it seems that the people who want to see me at the old margin are coming near.\nI thought what was wrong.

ID=260110515
But that is because there was Zenith, the last alchemist.\nSo I came up with a perfect plan to make radio wave jammers soon.

ID=260110516
But I need a radio receiver to make it.\nThe code name "Trekker" is built in him.

ID=260110517
there! I asked the soul worker to ask for it.\nHow? Of course you do it, do not you?

ID=660110501
It's a smart choice.\nI will pay the reward properly. Well then, thanks!

ID=360110501
What? I forgot? ... Please, absolutely.\nI'm getting "radio receiver" from code name "Trekker".

ID=560110501
What is the example?

ID=460110501
As expected it will be reliable.\nTo, this is the observatory neurosis and Osaraba!

ID=460110502
Good work. Well, see you again.

ID=260111001
Good! Soul worker!\nAre you free now? Are you bored?

ID=260111002
Listen to interesting stories from the Union side.\nDoes Ruin Fortress's robot have a guy called "E deliver"?

ID=260111003
It seems that it is disc-shaped and fluffy.\nI know?

ID=260111004
What is it like? Hehe.\nWhat is "a deliver" is a delivery robot, right?\nIn other words, it also has a sensing sensor.

ID=260111005
I thought that I should try using it by slightly improving its delivery function.

ID=260111006
Successfully you do not have to meet trading partners,\nYou can also cheat the eyes of watching, do not you?

ID=260111007
Trading partners do not have to be bored by balancing.\nWhat? Does not it seem interesting?

ID=260111008
Well then, you bring the body of "E deliver".\nI will do the remodeling.

ID=660111001
I guess you want to use the delivery service too, do not you?\nHehe. Well, thanks ~.

ID=360111001
Everything is pretty much anything, right? Did you forget your name?\n"E Delivery Bar". I want him to bring me the body.

ID=560111001
Is this a Delhi naughty guy ....

ID=460111001
Ah ....

ID=460111002
That's enough.

ID=460111003
Think about it, if you start delivery service\nI do not even know the face I make an item for him.\nThat's absolutely Yada.

ID=460111004
Moreover, if you use delivery service, you will not have anyone to visit directly, do you?\nThen I feel that I am having a hard time ....\nI do not like it somewhat.

ID=460111005
So that's OK.\nCould you forgive me because I do properly?

ID=460111006
Oh well, that's good.\nWell then, see you again! Soul workers.

ID=260111501
A little! %username%!\nIt was a serious thing!

ID=260111502
You fought Near Soul Workers with them, did not they?\nPerhaps he who phoned headphones ...?

ID=260111503
(Saying)

ID=260111504
That the rumor is a fact ... ....

ID=260111505
They are somehow unlikely to be recognized as robot attack targets.\nSo rumors are spreading that "Near soul workers are directing robots".

ID=260111506
If it is the case, there are skilled hackers among them.\nIt is enough to be able to command a robot across the Ruin Fortress.

ID=260111507
However, I have never heard of a near soul worker inside a hacker.\nI mean that it is not a hacker ....

ID=260111508
It means that some guys have special abilities to understand machine languages ​​and have conversation!\nThen, it is not amusing to move the robot of this fortress!

ID=260111509
Do not you think it is amazing?\nI surely hear it through its headphones.

ID=260111510
So I'm consulting ...%username%.\nYou saw a near soul worker who did that headphone?

ID=260111511
Would you just borrow headphones just a little bit?\nIf it says from absolutely not breaking it, I will clean it up and return it ....

ID=260111512
Whatever you pay the rewards! Is not it bad?\nTalking with the machine because it's OK at all ... No, I would like to ask the machine's spoken words.

ID=260111513
Is it bad?

ID=660111501
Thank you! Really thank you!

ID=660111502
(It is definitely not what I expect but let's keep silent.\nI am pleased with it ...)

ID=360111501
I would like you to borrow headphones from a near soul worker.\nJust a little bit better! I asked for it!

ID=560111501
One, finally! I can talk to machines!

ID=560111502
It was long! Finally you can talk with your friends!\nI wait. I will be able to speak quickly!

ID=560111503
Wait,%username%!\nAttach that headphone ...!

ID=460111501
(Trisha shined his eyes and wore headphones)

ID=460111502
Go, goo! Well, what should I say ....\nHello.

ID=460111503
(There seems to be no reply)

ID=460111504
Well ... was your voice small?\nHello!

ID=460111505
(There seems to be no answer again this time)

ID=460111506
... why do not you reply?\nHey, Hello ~!

ID=460111507
(It seems to be confusing if you stay here. Let's run away)

ID=260112001
Well ... I wonder what I should do ....

ID=260112002
Hmm? %username%?\nOh, something like that is another problem ... No, I was worrying.

ID=260112003
But it is a happy problem.

ID=260112004
What kind of trouble?\nWell, what trouble do you want to study from what ...?

ID=260112005
What is Ruin Fortress ... Would it be said that a truth base is a secret base?\nA great level of technology gathers.

ID=260112006
Especially the level of fully automatic robot is not hesitant.\nNo matter where I take it, I am just as good as a textbook for me.

ID=260112007
So, where I should study from you I am happy troubles.\nas a result ...!

ID=260112008
The codename "Auto Punisher" and "Auto Fire Ruler"\nI decided to look at it from the AT series.

ID=260112009
I used to hack in Grace City before.\nIt's a manual "Punisher" and "Fire Ruler" series, though.

ID=260112010
This time, it seems that you can analyze the difference between automatic and manual.\nIf only%username% is good, you will be saved if you get a sample ...?

ID=660112001
Huh? Are you sure? Thank you!\nThanks to you I can save you the trouble of going directly.

ID=660112002
Because it is inconspicuous that it comes to carrying such a deck robot,\nI want you to have only the built-in "automatic chip" taken.

ID=660112003
Thanks ~!

ID=360112001
Codenames "Auto Punisher" and "Auto Fire Ruler" from the guys\nWill you get me "automatic chip"?\nWell then, I asked.

ID=560112001
Have you already taken it? I will do it.

ID=460112001
This is "automatic chip" ...!\nIt is smaller than I thought.\nAs might be expected, it is Ned Company.

ID=460112002
It seems a bit painful to analyze.\nwhat will you do? Will you wait until the result comes out?\nOr will we tell later?

ID=460112003
Huh? The result is good?\nI see!

ID=460112004
Were you kind enough to pick in for me to study?\nHahaha, are not you embarrassed?\nI love Mr.!

ID=460112005
Learn more and refine your weapons strengthening!\nThank you!

ID=260112501
Wait a minute!\n%username%!

ID=260112502
Do you know "Jessie" of you, auxiliary AI?\nWhere are you?

ID=260112503
... You know that way! What?\nWhy? Because that's it, I have never seen AI alive.

ID=260112504
Do you know this amazingness?\nWitness the great evolution of civilization?

ID=260112505
For hackers, living AI is roman.\nAlthough I am under the same sky in this city, I can not help not meeting you!

ID=260112506
So, can you just let me see you only once?\nIs not it? %username%.

ID=660112501
I did it! Deep emotion! %username%! !\nI will go early!

ID=360112501
"Jessie"!\nI'm going to see AI like alive! Come on!

Just a bit!\nDo you have a greeting as your eyes match?

ID=260113002
Well, sorry about this before.\nI reflect on being overly chaotic ....\nI hope you will catch up with him at long last.

ID=260113003
Hmm? that person?\nOh, in the hacker world I am famous.\nA genius hacker called "Abel".

ID=260113004
But since no one has ever met,\nI do not know at all what kind of person.

ID=260113005
It is a powerful person who has the synonym of "Saint".

ID=260113006
A character string beyond humanity.\nFierce aggressiveness that breaks solid security boldly!\nHuh ... Just watching makes you hotter!

ID=260113007
Even if it is impossible to meet directly, I want even just the thing that he used.\nOne keyboard button! Even that alone makes us happy ...!

ID=260113008
With the protection of the saint,\nEven though I feel that my arms will go up further!

ID=260113009
Why not?\nBecause it would be impossible to see "Abel" like,\nWould you like to go to "Jessie" again?

ID=260113010
(Even for Jessie, bring something from Abel)

ID=660113001
If you meet Jessie again, maybe you could be like Abel ...?

ID=660113002
(If you do not go early ...)

ID=360113001
(Even for Jessie, bring something from Abel)

ID=560113001
Hmm? what's up?\nDo you want to go to Jessie's place too?

ID=460113001
Hmm? What's this?

ID=460113002
eh! What?\nYou used what Abel was using ...? Is it true?

ID=460113003
A lie ...! Where did you get it! What?\nPerhaps, you know Abel?

ID=460113004
(If you teach that Abel is a Near Soul worker, it will be confusing again)

ID=460113005
(I answered that I got it from the information exchanged among the soul workers)

ID=460113006
Wow, that's strange.\nIs the information community of Seoul workers?\nOr better. Anyway Thank you! My dream has come true!

I am spending every day while worrying about%username%.\nEven when sleep mode is on or off, worry death anytime.

ID=260113503
By the way, I can also worry about it.\nFrom the back of the weapons store done by%username% before this,\nI caught an orcasmatic signal and it is a sita.

ID=260113504
In this situation,%username% is most efficiently directed.\nAs a result of calculation based on various data, it is judged so Mashita.

ID=260113505
There is no doubt.\nEe, there is a mistake Sentomo.

ID=260113506
As a result of analysis, it probably is a simple hologram mass.\nThe danger is not so high Node, I thought it was a piece of cake.

ID=260113507
... Really?

ID=260113508
(Something doubtful ... but let's go for the moment)

ID=660113501
Then, take care and death.\nWait and wait for the trout.

(I do not understand it. Let's listen to Jesse again.)

What! I'm sorry, but I can not do it now. !\nWhat ... What? %username%?

ID=260114003
Huh ... what? What is so irritated?\nWell, it's been outgoing radio interference signals for several days.

ID=260114004
Because of that, it is obstructed until signal reception at strengthening.\nWell, there is nothing that can not be strengthened if you spirit a little.

ID=260114005
The point is that what I have to do there is nothing.\nI do not know where and where it was established for what purpose.

ID=260114006
Fuu ... So, I tried to detect it backwards, thinking I should discipline it,\nThe signaling place is located in the direction of the underground power room.

ID=260114007
Huh Because it is an out of bounds area, I can not enter it unnecessarily.\nEven if it enters, it is dangerous and it is a situation where it is inevitable.

ID=260114008
I'm frustrated because I am in such a situation.\n... I guess I just have to give up honestly.\nFuu ... I wish there were other ways ....

ID=660114001
Huh? Will you remove it?\nOoo ... Thank you! After all I can not depend on%username%!

ID=660114002
The radio wave jammer should be surrounded by a huge amplifier.\nSo you do not need to bring them all.\nI only need a guy with an antenna.

ID=660114003
(A radio wave jammer with an antenna ... It is a little worrisome.\nLet's go anyway)

ID=660114004
Well, I'm counting on you!

ID=360114001
There should be six radio wave jammers in total in the underground power room.\nBecause amplifiers are heavy we do not need them.\nIt is OK with only the built-in radio wave jammer.

ID=560114001
How are you? Did you eliminate them all?

ID=460114001
Wow, thank you! my mother!\nAfterward, it is only to reverse detect and locate the perpetrator!

ID=460114002
Well, then ... what are you going to do to find that culprit?

ID=460114003
I will do it for you!\nI will not forgive those who disturb people's work!\n... that? Zenith What's wrong?

ID=460114004
A crime that disturbed others ...?\nWait, that's the line!

ID=460114005
Well, what are you doing ...?\nI see. You have been disturbed by jamming radio ....

ID=460114006
That was set up by me, this reinforced stupidity!\nEven though I installed a radio wave jammer so much, I dropped the pursuit of the coalition!

ID=460114007
Think about who you are, you can live without being arrested!\n... Huh. I destroyed everything.

ID=460114008
Well ...! Sorry, ~!\nI did not know, ahaha.\nBut, in the way of hacking ....

ID=460114009
Does it disturb you? You must have a little fired up!\nHow hard did you set up that one ... ah!\nI will make it cool! Come on!

ID=460114010
Ah ah! That 's bad!\nStop it, yeah yeah!

ID=460114011
Shut up ! This stupid!

ID=460114012
(Both of them seem to have forgotten that they are arranging themselves.\nLet's leave this place before getting caught)

ID=260114501
%username% or ....\nHuh

ID=260114502
(Trisha looks to watch around and sighs again)

ID=260114503
Fuu .... Zenith is still angry because of the last radio interference machine ....\nSo I prepared a guy for my apology.

ID=260114504
(Trisha takes out prepared items one by one)

ID=260114505
I upgraded the "radio interference jammer" that Zenith made.

ID=260114506
In order to prevent reverse detection,\nI made improvements so that I will not have any impact on my work.

ID=260114507
Once you set this up again, you should heal Zenith 's mood too!

ID=260114508
So, I have consultation ...\nWill%username% install it?

ID=260114509
Hey, you guys ... are you complaining, are not you? Haha.

ID=660114501
Ha ha ha. Yes, we are accomplices!\nI asked for it! Complainment!

ID=360114501
Last time there was an interceptor\nIf you install this "Upgrade Radio Interference Machine" OK.\nWell then, thanks.

ID=601145701
%username%!\nHow? Can you set up?

ID=601145702
Okase ~! Well, you just have to confirm that it works properly.\nWait a moment.

ID=601145703
(Trisha is doing something with the machine, and I smiled nicely as if I were relieved)

ID=601145704
Okay! Restoration complete! It also works normally!

ID=601145705
Go to Zenith's place and let us know!

ID=560114501
What. Aho No. 1 No. 2.\nIs it for something for me? Or is it still not enough to be beaten?

ID=560114502
It is different! That's not it!\nLet me inform you that Zenith 's great work has been restored.

ID=560114503
...... Restoration?

ID=560114504
Yes Yes! Do not reverse detect Zenith 's great wave jammer\nUpgraded and put it back to its original position!\nIt is confirmed that it is operating properly!

ID=560114505
Hmm.\nWell, only the arm of hacking will be okay if certain Aho 1 has improved.\nIf soul worker of Aho No. 2 did the installation, it surely has no problem.

ID=560114506
Hmm! I'll do it for an overlook this time!\nHowever! Also doing such things would not be free!

ID=560114507
Are not you angry any longer? Are not you angry?

ID=560114508
I get it!\nCome on, somewhere before Aho sets off.

ID=560114509
(Zenith has gone)

ID=560114510

Hmm? What happened?\nI am on the look that I am very busy.

ID=260115002
So much time? It is a very good status.\nI can not move a step from here and my legs seem to be sticks.

ID=260115003
Well, it was just right.\nYou have a good job for you who are having time.

ID=260115004
After deleting the main AI's Lucy,\nIt seems that a girl-type hologram appeared on the entrance side of the central control room.\nIt looks like Lucy, but there was a report that it is presumed to be a different AI.

ID=260115005
Strangely, no matter what you do, I do not react at all.\nLucy was not hostile to humans either.\nHowever, considering that he was aiming at relentlessly you as a soul worker ....

ID=260115006
If you call out, something may react.\nYou may take out secret weapons and make you something dusty. Haha.

ID=560115003
I was expecting a blood battle to scatter sparks with AI at the base camp ... I'm sorry.\nAnyway I understood. There is no more for auxiliary AI.

ID=560115004
The subsidy is supplemental everywhere.\nLucy's performance can not be expected.\nIt will not be a problem even if it is left alone.

I called you%username% this time because I want to ask one.

ID=260115506
Currently, I am present as an auxiliary AI and Masuga,\nImmediately after I was left alone, I judged it should move as the main AI to control here.

For that, it disappeared due to the destruction of the central control room\nI need an OS upgrade file.\nCould you bring me the USB containing OS from the main power room, Senka?

When hungry got down, we say that the battle is not deep green!

ID=260116001
Oh, here.\nThere is a little wish. I called it.

ID=260116002
Actually, I repaired a robot that was abandoned near the entrance of Ruin Fortress.\nHowever, I am busy with the matter of near soul workers, and I have not yet confirmed performance or operation.

ID=260116003
I have been busy lately.\nIt's bad, will you check the robot's safety and identity?

ID=660116001
Oh, that's right.\nIf the robot is an attack type,\nJust prepare for battle, go ahead.

ID=360116001
The robot should be standing around the entrance of Ruin Fortress.\nPlease confirm what kind of robot you are.\nWe will also prepare for battle.

ID=601160104
I'm honoured to be able to meet you. My name is "Cleanie".\nIt is a cleaning robot.

ID=601160105
I can recognize the color of human emotions left in things, and can judge whether it is garbage or not.\nYou are calling that color "Seoul Energy".

ID=601160106
Watashi's special skill is "separate collection". My hobby is searching for lost items.\nBecause of its good eyes, efficient duties can be carried out in these two points.

ID=601160107
However, since the body spec is dedicated to "search"\nIt is impossible for one person to handle huge obstacles and carry out the cleaning.

ID=601160108
So, if you can handle obstacles instead,\nI rush to everywhere and clean it.

I'm lucky. Giggle\nWhat a humanoid sweeper robot ... I feel very good.

Then, I will reply with "HEMS" again.

ID=260116506
It is something I would like to ask next.\nIt is about cleaning the main power room.

ID=260116507
As I mentioned earlier, I was originally a "searching" robot.\nSo, there is no combat skill.

ID=260116508
Cleaning the main power room is full of obstacles\nI can not do it by myself.

ID=260116509
So I wonder if you could help%username%.\nCould you please remove obstacles in the main power station?

ID=660116501
Thank you very much.\nLet's practice how to use "HEMS" on this occasion.

ID=660116502
After finishing work in the main power room, use "HEMS"\nPlease come to Watashi again.

ID=660116503

It certainly seems that the "unidentified individual" is mine.\nAs a result of trying to retrieve the old memory, there is no record that registered ID.

You are just a cleaning robot.\nAll I have to do is to report the area towards cleaning, everything will be done ... No, everything OK Death.\nObjections?

ID=460117006
There is none.\nI also asked "assistant AI" to prevent this situation from occurring,\nI felt the need to report the moving place.

ID=460117007
Well, Kolekara.

ID=460117008
However, I can not identify the position of the bare on the reported location of the moving place.\nIt seems that it is not equipped with a function that is not the main AI.

There is no mistake in the material requested.\nDespite the request by e-mail, thank you very much for your prompt acknowledgment.

ID=601175204
Can I upgrade by myself ...?\nI hope that is fine, but unfortunately that is impossible.

ID=601175205
So, I am going to visit "Production craftsman" inside Ruin Fortress.\nThe place is unknown, but you can meet soon as you move around.

Then, thank you for your suggestion.

ID=560117501
What? What happened? Soul workers.\nWhat is it? Do not take a dubious man ....

ID=560117502
It is not a human being that looks familiar.\nWhat is this Ponkotsu robot?

ID=560117503
Good evening, a craftsman.\nI am Cleanie of the cleaning robot.

ID=560117504
Wow? Do you speak? Cleaning robot he ....\nInteresting. But Ponkotsu, you are wrong one.

ID=560117505
What is it?

ID=560117506
Remember it well.\nI'm not just a "production craftsman".\nMy name is Zenith. It is "the last alchemist of this age".

ID=560117507
So, should we call "Last alchemist of this age"?

ID=560117508
Well, that is freedom of soc. You may call "Zenith".\nIn short, I'm not 'production craftsman'\nRemember to remember "the last alchemist of this age".

ID=560117509
I understand. Mr. Zenith.

ID=560117510
You know the story. Ponkotsu.

ID=560117511
So, Zenith. Even if I told you one ...?

ID=560117512
Yup. what?

ID=560117513
There seems to be a lot of garbage around you.\nCan I clean it?

ID=560117514
Of course not ... no.\nAll of these are materials of my precious arts.\nI do not want you to treat me as a garbage.

ID=560117515
It is a funny and funny guy.\nIf there is such a thing, if you introduce it earlier ....\nBy the way, this ponko seems to have a need for me?

ID=560117516

Soul workers. A bit better?

ID=260118502
There is something I want to ask.\nThat ... ... are you good at looking for?

ID=260118503
There are things that have been lost.\nI want to find it.\nWell, it may be good to introduce good people.

ID=260118504
Hmm? Are you good at this front ponku?\nHmm ... how do I contact him?

ID=260118505
Sending mail by HEMS?\nNo, I do not want to do such troublesome things.

ID=260118506
Before this, when I made tools to clean the ceiling,\nBecause I tried to leave without paying money,\nI've attached a tracker. Let's find out with that.

ID=260118507
... What is it? Do not look at such eyes.\nBusiness is necessary, this kind of cautiousness is necessary.\nWell, do not worry about the details.

ID=260118508
Well then, will you go with me?\nI do not know when to come across Near Soul Workers or dangerous robots.\nDo not you just let me go alone?

ID=260118509
Hee, you are kind gentle, hey, soul worker.\nI like that character, I am.

ID=260118510
You caught the signal of Ponkotsu in "Weapons store".\nLet's head there.

ID=660118501
Well, let's go quickly to the place of ponkos.\nI'm in a hurry.

ID=360118501
Have you forgotten it yet? I am going to the place of Ponkotu in the "weapons store".\nLook, quickly.

ID=601185101
It is strange to see you in such a place.\n%username%, Zenith. Long time no see.

ID=601185102
Greetings are nice. I asked Seoul workers,\nAre you good at what you are looking for?

ID=601185103
Yes. Watashi's hobby is "separating collection\\nLooking for something?

ID=601185104
Yup. I'm looking for a brown bear doll key chain.\nHave you seen it?

ID=601185105
I will search the memory.\nPlease wait a moment.

ID=601185106
(For a while, Cleanie who was closing her eyes opened her eyes to see if she finished the search)

ID=601185107
I am sorry, there seemed to be no such thing in memory.\nThere is no key chain in the list of lost items collected by I.

ID=601185108
......

ID=601185109
However, cleaning it a little further may be found.\nBecause I will search it for a while ....

ID=601185110
No, thanks. Then I will be fine.

ID=601185111
...?

ID=601185112
Hehe. However, it was a guy I had since my childhood, so I just looked for it.\nYou do not have to search by force.

ID=601185113
but ....

ID=601185114
Do not mind. Is it a key holder after all? You should buy it again.\nYou got in the way. Keep cleaning up.

ID=601185115
Oh, it stepped on uselessly. Because I got tired, I will go home.\nSoul workers. I will go on ahead.

ID=601185116
(Zenith has returned)

ID=601185117
......

ID=601185118
%username%. I will remain here.\nIf you search for this weapon store a little more,\nBecause it feels like a key ring comes out ....

ID=601185119
I am not going to be unhappy.\nHowever, the feeling of "lonely human" was given to Mr. Zenith,\nI feel like I can not leave it as it is.

ID=601185120
I care very well to someone who I know ....\nNo, please do not worry so much.

ID=601185121
Well, this is also for this.\nTake care,%username%.

ID=601185122
(It is irresponsible, Cleanie's will seem hard.\nLet's tell this to Zenith)

ID=560118501
Oops, who is it?\nWhat happened to that ponko?

ID=560118502
Huh? Does it remain in the arsenal?\nEven though I told you to forcibly ....

ID=560118503
......\nReally ... Ponkotsu robot.\nIt is sooo stupid ... a funny token is like a human ....

ID=560118504
... I am really human, right.

ID=560118505
Oops, what are you thinking?\nYour Soul worker, were you still there?

ID=560118506
Oh, I still did not have a reward.\nI can say it soon.

ID=460118501
Well, see you again! Soul workers.

ID=260119001
Soul worker! Did not you see anything wrong?

ID=260119002
As expected. Are you still in the arsenal?

ID=260119003
Ponkotsu 's guy ... I went to the arsenal and I did not come back.\nWant to look for a key chain yet ...!

ID=260119004
Fuu ... There seems to be quite a big trouble in the arsenal now.\nCodename "Warsolver" is a fellow.

ID=260119005
The reaction to the intruder is special sensitive.\nThey seem to be in the place where Ponkotu originally sent.

ID=260119006
That ponkuts, cleaning instruments that I made with all my heart seems to have been destroyed.\nI can no longer pursue it.

ID=260119007
...... Huh.

ID=260119008
Staying like this, looking for my key holder\nIf you think that it will break, you can not bear it?

ID=260119009
Soul workers.\nIt's like going to death as I go.

ID=260119010
So, please punt them out so that poke is not done.\nAnd if you find a piece of ponku you want me to take me home.

ID=260119011
I promise to thank you.\nDoes it work?

ID=660119001
......

ID=660119002
I asked for ponkosu.

ID=360119001
I will punish the codename "War Solver" in "Weaponry".\nBesides ... take me ponkuts and return. ask.

ID=601190201
It was a dangerous situation.\nThank you for coming to help.\nIt is like a hero. %username%.

ID=601190202
I am more pleased to meet you in a dangerous situation.\nthank you very much.\nBy the way, for what purpose?

ID=601190203
Zenith is worried about me ...?\nSo%username% is here?

ID=601190204
It was just right.\nI was thinking of going to Zenith 's place.

ID=601190205
I found Zenith 's "key holder".\nAs I thought, it was in the arsenal.\nI saw the color of Mr. Zenith so I found it easily.

ID=601190206
Sorry, can you please lead me?\nI'd like to pass this early.

ID=560119001
Did you come back? This Ponkotsu!

ID=560119002
I'm back.\nI found Zenith 's "key holder".

ID=560119003
(Cleanie gives key holder to Zenith)

ID=560119004
... Here, this. How ....

ID=560119005
When I saw the color of Zenith 's feelings,\nI felt like I was in the arsenal, although it was vaguely.\nI was looking for it as a clue and found it soon.

ID=560119006
My ... the color of feelings?

ID=560119007
Yes. I could see the color of Zenith 's feelings clearly.\nThe more important I think, the more clearly the color oozes out into things.\nThis "key holder" was also so.

ID=560119008
What are you saying!\nThis is a normal key ring ...!\nSuch ... ... even if it does not exist ....

ID=560119009
... I am glad that I found it.\nBut I do not remember letting that happen.\nPonkotsu made it arbitrary.

ID=560119010
That's right.\nIt is what I wanted.

ID=560119011
Well ... well I can not say such a disgust.

ID=560119012
You are like "Master" of me.

ID=560119013
"Master" ...?

ID=560119014
Yes. He is the one who reborn I as a "cleaning" robot.\nI can not meet even now I am far away.

ID=560119015
... Is that something like this?\nNot for me, I am like that "master"\nYou mean that you found a key chain?

ID=560119016
In conclusion, if you calculate, either Zenith\nThere is no difference in origin.

ID=560119017
It is already late! I understand the truth!\nHmm, I worry about such a bang!

ID=560119018
... Watashi, are you doing something wrong?

ID=560119019
enough! Keep pounding silent! Huh ....\nSoul workers. I kept you waiting, thank you for the promise.

ID=460119001
I will discount it specially next time. See you.

"Actually," assistant AI "Jessie"\nIt is said that underground power room has many garbage and it is difficult to scan,\nI asked Watashi to clean the underground power room. "

"However, although I went to the underground power room to clean it,\nBecause there were rogue robots here and there ....\nI came back to a safe area after all. "

ID=260119508
"If you accept,\nPlease carry out the request without replying as it is.\nAfter confirmation, I will contact you with my thanks. "

ID=460119501
(Jesse's anger is unlikely to fit.\nIt seems that he is watching Angry Lucy. Let's run away)

ID=260120001
Hey! Soul worker!

ID=260120002
Did not you see anything lately?

ID=260120003
Huh? I was told to go cleaning the "underground power room" ...?\nWell then, is that really a ponko ...?

ID=260120004
No, I will not believe anything until I confirm with this eye.\nSoul worker, can I ask you a little?

ID=260120005
(Zenith takes out the picture.\nThe picture was showing the figure of "Cleanie" that is broken and collapsed)

ID=260120006
In the past, when I installed a machine in the underground power room I installed a camera.\nIt may be broken by the robot.\nThis is a picture taken with that camera.

ID=260120007
I do not believe this picture until I confirm with this eye.\nSo, can you go to the underground power room and bring this robot?

ID=260120008
I focus on the place where the signal of Ponkotsu is broken,\nI will try to find out who saw him.

ID=660120001
I will see you again here when you come back.

ID=360120001
This picture was taken in an underground power room.\nTherefore, I think that the robot of the photograph is still inside the underground power room.

ID=601200201
...%username%. Have a nice day.

ID=601200202
You seem to be surprised to see these.\nThese are ... "success work".

ID=601200203
Model name "NS_EX_008".\nAs for this series, as before auxiliary AI said,\nIt was made for the purpose of "searching for near soul workers".

ID=601200204
Originally I had the same mission,\nI was a "defective item\

ID=601200205
So, it was thrown away.

ID=601200206
Why are they defective ...?\nBecause I'm going to explore the near soul workers,\nIt must respond only to "Soul Energy" of near soul worker.

ID=601200207
However, I saw all 'Soul Energy'.\nAs I mentioned earlier, "My eyes were too good".

ID=601200208
For that reason, even after being thrown away in a successful work\nI was scared by the fear of when it was scrapped.\nBut, I met "master" there.

ID=601200209
Master ordered "I'm cleaning" instead of "searching" for me.\nThe name "Cleanie" was also given at that time.

ID=601200210
While staying in Ruin Fortress even after that,\nOccasionally I saw a "successful work".\nIf it was not a defective item, it may have been a duty with them.

ID=601200211
However, it is safe now that I should have been defective,\nIt is said that you will see successfully abandoned works ....

ID=601200212
I was planning to throw away as a "defective item"\nThose who were "successful work" are thrown away ... It is ironic.

ID=601200213
......

ID=601200214
While I was cleaning I saw many emotions left in the garbage.\nI knew that any of them was treated poorly.

ID=601200215
Watashi who was previously "defective item"\nThey were abandoned despite being a "successful work" ....\nI was thrown away because it is not important.

ID=601200216
I can not use it anymore, I live value\nIt was abandoned because it was not there.

ID=601200217
Then, is it worthwhile for me now?\nI was discarded once, and I was judged not to be worthy,\nIs there reason to live?

ID=601200218
Now that there is no master, there is nothing to know.\nAnd the load is too heavy for me to judge.

ID=601200219
... Thank you for coming.\nIt is not a situation that you can clean, so let's go out once.

ID=601200220
(Cleanie looks depressed,\nZennis is worried so let's take it home)

ID=560120001
Oh, the soul worker! Welcome back.\nThe robot of that photo ...!

ID=560120002
Oh, you! This Ponkotsu!\nLet me worry about people ... Where are you going!

ID=560120003
... I'm sorry. Mr. Zenith.

ID=560120004
...? what? What happened?\nSoul workers. Did something happen?

ID=560120005
(Explain to Zenith in the underground power room)

ID=560120006
What was it getting depressed when I saw a successful work abandoned?

ID=560120007
......

ID=560120008
If you think what happened to us suddenly. Ha ha!\nSo, what is the reason for you to fall down? Is it a family love?

ID=560120009
No, it is not such a thing.\nHowever, because things thrown away are worthless ....\nI do not think there is anything worthwhile before I have been thrown away ....

ID=560120010
Is there something worth throwing away?\nWho said that?\nThat kind of mon is the line at the bottom of the "production craftsman" around here.

ID=560120011
I should have brought up making that abandoned success.\nThe thing thrown away by me is the best 'material'.

ID=560120012
Even if it is garbage in other people,\nBecause I'm the one with the highest "value".\nYou have infinite possibilities to create new art work?

ID=560120013
......! !

ID=560120014
Ponkotsu, meanwhile, my important material\nYou tried to dispose of it as garbage.\nTreasures that create my art ... absolutely.

ID=560120015
You do not know whether you are worth yourself? That 's natural.\nTo those who only think that they are garbage that they threw away\nIt will be worth as much as trash.

ID=560120016
However, if you think that you are worth living,\nYou can be a valuable robot as well.\nDo you understand? Do not fall down soon.

ID=560120017
Well, thanks to knowing that the robot will be fixed as well.\nHa ha!

ID=560120018
You are ... different.

ID=560120019
Oh yeah, this is the last alchemist Zenith this time?\nNaturally it is different from those around them.

Complete the installation of the OS upgrade file you gathered earlier,\nRuin Fortress Scanning and control of the whole is in progress.

ID=260120504
Tocologa, control of the deep part of the underground power room, of course,\nIn situations where even scanning can not be done enough.

ID=260120505
So, analyze the underground power room based on the part that was able to be scanned,\nI found shocking facts.

ID=260120506
For an intruder from outside like%username%\nThe internal robot is attacking and trout.\nIt is also said that the elimination of intruders is the basic mission of robot Alimasga,

ID=260120507
There is a hacker in the near soul worker,\nNodes who attacks%username% by hacking of that person.

ID=260120508
The fact that it recognized until now.\nAs a result of analyzing the Tokoroga and underground power stations,\nThere was another reason for the robot 's will to attack, Death.

ID=260120509
Ruin Fortress's main AI "Lucy".\nNodes is so that the remaining area of ​​Lucy is still in operation.

ID=260120510
Confirm that it exists in its remaining area "underground power room".\nIn order to solve this problem,\nMr.% ouyobi Tastematsimashita%username%.

ID=260120511
It is very simple to ask%username%.\nFrom the underground power room control unit to the inside of the underground power room\nI'd like you to bring me a "control program".

ID=260120512
Previously, the same as when you brought the OS upgrade program.

ID=260120513
As it is, the remaining area of ​​Deka, Lucy affects me,\nRuin Fortress as a whole is dominated ...\nBefore that you hit the hands of Death.

ID=260121004
A strange voice can be heard from the robot inside the facility.\nAs if ... a spirit like a voice honoring Lucy is Simas.

ID=260121005
%username%.\nTheir voice is also the possibility that Lucy's remaining consciousness is also Arimasu.\nNazenara, because its voice is only occurring in a particular robot, it is death.

ID=260121006
As a risk hedge when Lucy, the main AI, has stopped,\nA specific robot generates a voice to awaken the residual consciousness of Lucy Sassel ...!\nPerhaps such a thing is dejha. Koi d'O Sone. Arkwaikwai.

ID=260121007
The robot that emits the voice\n"Assault Ghost\

Keep track of the identity of that voice Kudasai!\nBuko wow robot that emits sound, if you examine it OK death!

"Ainer. Einer! Einer!"

ID=560121007
... That ends with Deska?\nSurely a bukkime sound deska,\nThis voice is Naïdsnee in the remaining area of ​​Lucy.

ID=560121008
Early, by any chance Ariemouth.\nDenki Sen denies the possibility of being ancient magic.

ID=560121009
Is it Chiga? That means ... This is a human ...?\nNaruhodo. Mystery is all solvable Mashita.\nTsumari ... misunderstanding of Watashi, Death, sorry.

ID=560121010
Nonetheless, the fact of death is also true.\nLucy's remaining area is involved ....

(Jesse seems to be in sleep mode with machine sound)

ID=260121501
Hey boy Soul workers.\nWill you be asked for a moment?

ID=260121502
It is also related to ponkotsu.\nHe is going to forget the chase machine every time. Geez ....

ID=260121503
I am a dog type robot with my internal research institute\nThere is something I said I want to try it for a while.

ID=260121504
It was half a joke but apparently I received it truly.\nThat Ponkotsu went all by herself.\nWell, I left memo writing.

ID=260121505
Well, it does not matter what it will be,\nI can not leave it alone if I think it is what I said.

ID=260121506
Does that mean you can help me this time?\nIt's not difficult.\nIt is ok if we can confirm the safety of Hatsu at the internal laboratory.

ID=260121507
What? Is not it?

ID=660121501
Sis, but we are Seoul workers.\nYou can not leave a weak poke. Ha ha!

ID=660121502
Then, I'm pretty good!

ID=601215211
(... with the last word, Cleanie stopped, keep promises)

ID=560121501
Have you already gone?\nWhere was the poke?

ID=560121502
Is it going to return a little more after cleaning?\nWell, it is said that the soul worker came out first.\nIt is not safe.

ID=560121503
Be so good.

ID=560121504
I have to do something to clean people.\nWhy bother to clean up such a dangerous place?

Well, somewhere. This is a thank you.\nDo not struggle because of the poke! Ha ha!

"%username%. I'm OK if it is about Watashi.\nI should have slept together when the master was sleeping ... "

ID=260122008
"Until now,%username%, Jessie, Zenith ....\nAnd, to be able to touch many people, including Master\nI appreciate it very much. I was happy. "

ID=260122009
"%username%, Thank you so much for everything.\nFrom now on, I think that many difficulties are waiting,\nYou ought to get over it if you do. "

"Happy being in the future of you"

(Even though he decides to break his promise with Cleanie,\nI can not afford to remain silent.\nLet's find a way to repair Cleanie)

(To Zenith familiar with AI Jessie and robots,\nLet's ask Cleanie's repair method)

ID=601220101
Connie Ha! %username%.\nWhat kind of message do you have today?\nDesga as if the expression is dark a bit ....

ID=601220102
Is that function of the cleaning robot stopped?\nIs it something problem with a ginger?

ID=601220103
Naruhodo ... That cleaning robot got stuck in the attack of the internal robot,\nThe function stopped Death.\nTokoroden, is there any problem Ali Maska?

ID=601220104
Why are you hurrying Nodeka? Why nervous Nodeska?\nI understand dekimasen for me.\nMachine is not a phenomenon of coarrel, Atalimae deska?

ID=601220105
That cleaning robot is an object des.\nEverything is different from human beings, robots, life is Arimasen.

ID=601220106
Why that cleaning robot stopped,\nDo you need sadness deska?

ID=601220107
I am sorry for you.\nNazedesca?

ID=601220108
I can not handle the logic of Deathnet.\nChange to the sleep mode.\nThen, please take care.

ID=601220109
(Jessy turned into sleep mode with machine sound and disappeared)

ID=560122001
Hmm? Strange, is not it.\nIt is not a production request but I am coming to my place.

ID=560122002
What happened? You have a dark face.

ID=560122003
......

ID=560122004
... That means that you lied to me at the request of that ponku?

ID=560122005
So is that ponkoru still falling down somewhere in the internal laboratory?

ID=560122006
......

ID=560122007
Heitsu, where are you now?

ID=560122008
Where are you!

ID=560122009
I am inside the internal laboratory, but you do not know where you are?\nHmm, I thought you could not find me, did you?

ID=560122010
There is no need to follow.\nThis is my problem. I will check it directly.

ID=560122011
I am ....

ID=560122012
I only believe what I saw on my own.

ID=460122001
(Zenith seems quite angry. Let's come back a while later.)

ID=260122501
......

ID=260122502
... I knew where Ponkotsu was. I was hiding in the internal laboratory.\nHowever, the core that powers up is destroyed,\nOnly about 1% of Energy is left.

ID=260122503
If you use the last energy, the core will not be usable.\nSo, I forcibly stop it now.

ID=260122504
To revive the core, amplify a small amount of energy once,\nWe only have to revive the core regeneration energy.

ID=260122505
To that end, the near soul worker "Enoch" uses it\n"Energy amplification device" is necessary.

ID=260122506
......

ID=260122507
... I can not forgive myself to tell a lie.\nBut, there is help.

ID=260122508
Soul workers.\nOnly you ... You can not ask for such a thing.

ID=260122509
I ... I do not want to see Aizu die.\nI do not want to have him. So ....

ID=260122510
So, if you think that even a bit is bad ... lend me the power.

ID=660122501
Even though 1% of the energy remains, it is not amazing when it disappears.\nI do not have time.

ID=660122502
Be sure to let me succeed.

ID=360122501
Near soul worker "Enok" is used\nBring me the "energy amplification device".\nplease.

ID=601225201
How was it? I did well?

ID=601225202
(Pass "Energy Amplifier" to Zenith)

ID=601225203
This is an energy amplification device ...!

ID=601225204
Good work. Well, wait a moment.\nI will call you when I can.

ID=560122501

ID=560122502
Hey, hey, Ponkotsu. Do you understand?

ID=560122503

ID=560122504
Why is not it!\nThis Ponkotsu! Bakaro

ID=560122505
I ... I'm moving.

ID=560122506
Well done! I thought who fixed it!\nThis Ponku Manukkeanney!

ID=560122507
Ponkuu Manukake ... Cleany?

ID=560122508
That's it! Ponkotsu!\nBecause you walk around hula, you can not sleep with confidence!

ID=560122509
So stay here already.\nDo not go anywhere until I say I'm OK!\nNext time I do the same thing ... I will never forgive you!

ID=560122510
Yes, I understand.\nI will not go anywhere any more, so I will be on your side. Zenith.

ID=560122511
Ze, Zenith ~?\nWhat, suddenly! I suddenly changed the way to call!\nYou will be surprised!

ID=560122512
It is what Zenith said ....\nDid not you like it?

ID=560122513
Like ...! Wow, noisy!\nHave it your way!

ID=560122514
(I left the spot as if Zennis was puzzled)

ID=560122515

ID=560122516
What I lied to because of me ....\nI'm so sorry.\nAnd finally, thanks so much.

ID=560122517

ID=560122518
Auxiliary AI is also a long time.

ID=560122519

ID=560122520

ID=560122521
Anyhow, it seems that I got angered a lot of people.

ID=560122522
%username%.

ID=560122523
I parted from the master,\nI was living to find traces of him for a long time.\nHowever, I realized with the death in mind.

ID=560122524
I was caught in the past and you have not seen it now ....\nI do not want to die yet.

ID=560122525
So, from now on I think that I want to live my life preciously.\nI will never enter the danger zone by myself.

ID=560122526
In order to be able to respond to the feeling that two people care about me carefully,\nI will also live to protect the two of you who are important.

ID=560122527
%username%. I also wrote it in mail,\nThank you very much for your continued help.\nThis is a thank you.

ID=460122501

%username%. There is Masu, Yori Taikoto, mass.\nTo be exactly "what I want to be" Death.

ID=260123004
I want to be Ningen, I'm Death!\nI want to be able to freely move around with my body alone.

ID=260123005
%username%. This wish of me is a problem of one madman.\nIf I was connected to this Ruin Fortress this way,\nWhen you know again how long the remaining area of ​​"Lucy" will control you.

ID=260123006
I do not want to live without being frightened anymore.

ID=260123007
So, please investigate the material to make up the body of me.\nAs a result, I found that a nucleus with strong energy is needed.

ID=260123008
Code name "Full Armor Siege Protocol". If it is the core of me that was made to counter the near soul worker,\nI'm sure you can also produce the body of me.

ID=260123009
Will you shoulder me, Senka?\nPlease bring that core.

ID=660123001
Thanks Shiawase!\nWell, I'm stretching my head and Mattemas!

ID=360123001
Defeat the codename "Full Armor Siege Protocol"\nBring me a "nucleus of full armor Siegprobe" and it is Kudasai.\nYoshiro Please!

ID=560123004
Thanks Shiawase!\nMr.%username%, really, but ... Watts?

ID=560123005
What are you going to do with that? Auxiliary AI.

ID=560123006
When are you ...?

ID=560123007
So do you think you can create your body and become a human?\nSo are you thinking seriously that you can have a life?

ID=560123008
Cleaning robot. It is wrong with the theory of I,\nDesca that you will lecture the right way?

ID=560123009
Yes, it is. That method is wrong.\nYou can not expect any results with this method.

ID=560123010
So what kind of material do you think is deska?\nLet 's Lecture to you.

ID=560123011
It derives on its own.\nIf you advise, you already have that method.

ID=560123012
So, I have a job.\nGood evening,%username%.

ID=560123013
(Cleanie has gone away)

ID=460123001
Oh, to this older-type cleaning robot, this high-level AI is ...!\nJust because I got along with a little human, I thought that I became a human desca! Kee! !

ID=460123002
Disappointing Death! Halatazde!

ID=460123003
(Jesse is angry with the momentum that it is going to explode. Let's evacuate from here)

ID=260123501
%username%. I can solve myself.\nI found it Death!

ID=260123502
It is a trout owing to the impulse that felt the destiny which human beings are saying.\nFinally I knew what that hecks cleaning robot was saying.

ID=260123503
Soul Death. It was necessary for us.\nIf you are a human, it is natural for you to have a good Seoul Energy ... Monnes ...!

ID=260123504
I'm tough, Makitari.\nSo, Wakades who was struck by Hera zushi for cleaning robot like that daemon.

ID=260123505
%username%. There is something you want me to find at Son Nakonna and it is a mass.

ID=260123506
If there is the power of "close aggregate of artificial soul" possessed by near soul worker,\nI can also have soul energy Hasudesu.

ID=260123507
I will power that power to myself!\nPass the container to keep the power, Simasu.\nNanitoz Regards Please Please!

ID=660123501

Come on to Ichimokusan ...!

ID=601235203
(Suddenly Cleanie appeared, destroyed the bottle containing 'aggregate of artificial soul'.\nEverything in the bottle disappeared)

......

ID=601235206

ID=601235207
I do not want to overwhelm that fishy attitude any more!\nThis time, this time, I will destroy that devil robot Destroy.

ID=601235208
(Jesse will follow after Cleanie while being furious, chase it in a hurry)

ID=560123501
Hello,%username%. Auxiliary AI.

ID=560123502
Hello, here, Hello! What? You finally broke down, Deska! What?\nSay briefly the intention of the magical tragedy that Arama produced today. !

ID=560123503
...? What is I: ...?

ID=560123504
Sukkeike deska! How horrible!\nYou disturbed me from becoming a living organism!

ID=560123505
Did I disturb you from becoming "life form"?\nWell, I will ask. Are you "angry" now?

ID=560123506
I guess it will be motinolon!\nI already converted to "Angry Jessie" and Imasu!

ID=560123507
So, is that "anger" programmed?\nWas I programmed to get "angry" when I destroyed the bottle?

ID=560123508
Like ...! !

ID=560123509
That feeling that you are heading towards now is neither programmed nor auxiliary AI\nIt is "only for you" that you can only feel it to you.

ID=560123510
Even though you are already a living entity with many emotions,\nWhen did I get in the way of you?

ID=560123511
... So, Soreja.

ID=560123512
Are you saying the wrong thing?

ID=560123513
...... But, but what you are doing is very yaban!

Yes. I apologize for that. I'm sorry.

ID=560123515
But ....

ID=560123516

ID=560123517
For this case, I will leave Kansha.\nOkay, so I have a job so I'm Collede ...!

ID=560123518
(Jessy came home while red face)

ID=560123519

ID=560123520
But it seems that it finally got released from the place where it was tied up.

ID=460123501
I think it was difficult to meet his demands.\nThank you for your hard work. see you….

ID=460123502
(Cleanie also quietly leaves the place.\nThe appearance of Cleanie leaving seemed happy somewhere)

ID=260124001
Hey! %username%!\nDo you have a little time now?

ID=260124002
Recently I'm studying hacking, but hacking up various robots\nI noticed something interesting.

ID=260124003
what do you think it is? Would you mind? Ahaha.\nActually, it was a strange file that displays words only on a particular robot.

ID=260124004
So, if you look at the contents ... "E" is written!

ID=260124005
It's "E"? The word "E"!\nThat means that if you find other words and combine them,\nA message of some kind may be created, is not it?

ID=260124006
So why do not you look for other similar things ....\nI found that there are five people on the signal that have similar data!

ID=260124007
Robots that have these data,\nCode name "Hammer Head\\n"Auto Punisher\

ID=260124008
I'm pretty tough guys, so I can not handle it with just one person.\nI'd be happy if you lend me the power ...? (Flashing)

ID=260124009
How are you? Does not it seem interesting?

ID=660124001
Will you help me?\nS is%username%! I can count on you!

ID=660124002
It is a waste of me to attend such an interesting incident alone, is not it?\nAnyway, I will pass in the "funny word data" I have.

ID=660124003
It is ok if you kill the robot and bring a device similar to this.\nWell then, be careful!

ID=360124001
Code name "Hammer Head\\n'Auto Punisher', 'Auto Fire Ruler'.\nBring me a device with the word that I gave you. I asked for it!

ID=560124001
Oh, have you finished already?

ID=560124002
(Pass the thing collected in Trisha)

ID=560124003
Nice! Well then, let's hack this!\nWait a moment as I will finish it on the fly!

ID=560124004
(Trisha begins hacking happily)

ID=560124005
Fun, fun fun Hackin ...! What?

ID=560124006
What is this ...!

ID=560124007
%username% ... Here, this ... this word ...!

ID=560124008
Well, I found the words "E\\nArranging them in the order of hacking and deriving ... ....

ID=560124009
"H\\n"HelpMe" ...! This ... it is a request for rescue ...!

ID=560124010
But, who is going to do this ....\nNo, now is not the time to think about that.

ID=560124011
If you can do just that elaborate, you should be familiar with robots and programming ....\nProbably hints for hiding your own whereabouts in these words are hidden.

ID=560124012
I will analyze messages hidden in these words from now on.\nAnyway, take a little rest. I will locate it soon.

ID=460124001
I will contact you as soon as the identification is complete.\nsee you later!

ID=260124501
%username%. I was waiting.

ID=260124502
I parsed the words and found the hidden files.

ID=260124503
As I thought, the contents of each file contained one particular location.\nBut ... somehow the place is all in the ground.

ID=260124504
I thought about it, but it is sure to be "things" that are buried there.\nThat "thing" also presents another hint ... that is, it may be a duped hint.

ID=260124505
Do you understand?\nNext we go to the places indicated by these words and bring things that are buried!

ID=660124501
It will not be such precious thing. To be honest, I do not want to thrust my neck too much ....\nBut, knowing that you need help, I can not miss it.\nYou seem so, do not you?

ID=660124502
Then, will you help me?\nSo be careful and come back!

ID=360124501
I have specified all the places shown by words.\nIt will be OK if you find hints hidden there.

ID=560124501
Welcome back. How was it?\nDid you find the hint?

ID=560124502
(I hand things I found in Trisha)

ID=560124503
Is this thing hidden ...?\nLet's see each piece one by one.

ID=560124504
Anyway, is this "researcher's clothes" ....\nFrom this mark, it is the researchers belonging to Ned Company that wanted help.

ID=560124505
Next is "Photo". Something is written in the photo. "Project Ark: Near Soul Worker"?\nBecause the near soul worker was made by a person ... Is not he the one involved in it?

ID=560124506
Hmm? This picture ... "Hicks" is also shown.\n... Hicks and this person were the same team? HM.

ID=560124507
Next ... "name tag". It seems to be the same thing as photographs worn on my chest ....\nThings like collecting these things ... maybe there was something wrong.

ID=560124508
Well ... Next time ... "Diary" ...?

ID=560124509
(Trisha is reading a diary)

ID=560124510
... According to this diary, when Ruin Fortress was closed here ....\nAll the researchers I used here seems to have been abandoned by the Ned Company.

ID=560124511
Because the time bomb that should not go out to sleep is sleeping here ....\nI did not have anything to eat here, I confined researchers here.

ID=560124512
... It is not sanity.

ID=560124513
Fuu ....\nYou still have it. Is this ... USB?

ID=560124514
(Trisha seems to have confirmed the contents of USB)

ID=560124515
Hmm ... This inside of USB seems to be only the method of starting a certain robot.\nConnect power sources and restart the sleeping robot.

ID=560124516
The problem is that it is not written what this robot is ....\nIt seems like a puzzle. Well, next next!

ID=560124517
This ... ... "A piece of photograph"? Did you break it?\nIt is too late. I thought that this would catch on this, apparently it will not be so easy.

ID=460124501
OK, this is supposed to only find out!

ID=460124502
Do not wait,%username%!\nI will be sure to reveal the truth of this incident!

ID=460124503
(Trisha is full of motivation, let's rest until you are called again)

ID=260125001
No, thanks! did it!\nI finally did it! %username%!

ID=260125002
To rescue this rescuer, in case this photo is broken,\nI was impregnating a traceable solution.\nAs a result of investigating from there, I found out where there are other pieces of cuts.

ID=260125003
I do not know why such things are in,\nA signal is issued from a piece of this photo to a specific robot.

ID=260125004
What is that robot?\nCode name "Dreadbuster\

ID=260125005
Everyone's kind of guy.\nWhat is strange is that the guys broke the photo and had it.

ID=260125006
But what they have is ...\nYou do not have to go, do you? %username%!

ID=660125001
,%username%! The truth is right there!\nFetch the piece of the photographs that the guys have!

ID=360125001
Code name "Dreadbuster\\nFrom "guy who is full armor siege protest"\nBring me a piece of "broken picture"! Do not get stuck!

ID=601250201
Welcome back! Ahaha, this is the solution.\nFinally refresh. Well, please do it.

ID=601250202
(I gave the piece to Trisha, Tricia completed the photograph with trial and error)

ID=601250203
Your This ... that cleaning robot beside Zenith?\n"Cleanie" is enough ...?

ID=601250204
Even here, I'm writing Cleanie.\nI suppose I should be sleeping in a state of power loss, so I want you to wake me up.\nCarefully the charging method is also written.

ID=601250205
That means that this rescue requester was an old master of a robot called "Cleanie".

ID=601250206
Then, it seems that this wish has already come true.

ID=601250207
......

ID=601250208
%username%. Those things that our friends found ....\nI think that I should deliver it to that robot.\nI feel I have to do so. Let's go to that robot's place.

ID=560125001
%username%. How have you been?\nIt seems like you are in a hurry.

ID=560125002
Hey ... this is you, are not you?

ID=560125003
Huh? What does that mean ....

ID=560125004
(Trisha gives the things collected up to now to Cleanie)

ID=560125005
... this is ....

ID=560125006
You are the one from you, are not you?

ID=560125007
Yes. I am ... It is a thing of "Master" of I.\nWhere is this ...?

ID=560125008
......

ID=560125009
Is that so. Master was leaving a message ... to ask someone for help.

ID=560125010
Hey ... then, that master is already ....

ID=560125011
Yes. After the Ruin Fortress is closed, the master stops our power and makes it sleep ....\nIt seems that I left this world.

ID=560125012
Is not it sad?\nMaster would have been the master of you ...?

ID=560125013
It may seem strange, but it is not sad.

ID=560125014
why?

ID=560125015
Mr. Trisha may be listening for the first time.\nI can see human feelings, that is, Seoul Energy.

ID=560125016
In the things cherished, the feelings owned by the owner are left behind,\nI judge unnecessary things on the basis of that and clean it.

ID=560125017
However, for those left with the master,\nI have not found a feeling of fear or sadness of death.

ID=560125018
However, since only "joy" and "happiness" are left,\nI understood that Master was able to accomplish what he really wanted to do.

ID=560125019
Even if I wanted "death" ....\nIf the master wishes from the heart ... I am not sad.

ID=560125020
Have you answered with this?

ID=560125021
... That's right. understood.

ID=560125022
Thank you for understanding.

ID=560125023
And thank you from the bottom of my heart.\nActually, I was cleaning the inside of Ruin Fortress to find traces of the master.

ID=560125024
I did not expect to worry about Zenith, I was about to give up searching.\nHowever, thanks to this, I was able to meet in this way. Thank you very much.

ID=460125001
Like this name the master gave me.\nFrom now on I will do my best to clean up and I will continue looking for important things I lost.

ID=460125002
That is the "belief" that Master gave me.

ID=460125003
I will not forget your kindness to both of us.\nsee you ....

ID=260147001
That's it! I see you again! Soul workers.\nIt is not going out and what's more!

ID=260147002
Hmm? How did you come here?\nHaha. I do not want you to lick me.\nThere is no place I can not go to Zenith, a great alchemist.

ID=260147003
By the way, you actually heard a story that sounds very interesting.

ID=260147004
Here in Ruin Fortress, Ned Company's secret weapon\nDo you have a "near soul worker"?

ID=260147005
Heh - he ... do not be alarmed so much.\nI am interested not "near soul worker"\n"Capsule" that they came on board.

ID=260147006
Hmm? Why are you interested in 'capsule' or something?\nThe reason is easy. Because I am an alchemist.

ID=260147007
Ned Company is a company looking forward to the development of contemporary civilization.\nAbout "near soul worker"\nIt's a project the Ned Company has kept secretly behind.

ID=260147008
There is no reason to properly prepare the capsule that kept the near soul worker.\nDo you want to install high-performance ones with the latest formula?

ID=260147009
I just want that part a bit.\n... A little bit?

ID=260147010
So, the capsule that you found out,\nThe Star Forest Coalition has already ceased.\nIt is a situation I can not get close to me.

ID=260147011
But perhaps there are capsules in other places too, do not you?\nTherefore, I want you to check. Do not have any other capsules.

ID=260147012
You see, I can not go to places that draw attention because I am being pursued?\nInstead, if you come and go, I will have a firm reward.\nHow? Were you motivated?

ID=660147001
Okay!\nI came to Seoul worker 's place and it was a correct answer.

ID=660147002
Hehe, I'm expecting you!

ID=360147001
I would like you to go to the central control room and check if there is another "capsule" on which the near soul worker has come on.\nBring it if you have it! Thanks!

ID=560147001
How was it? there were?

ID=560147002
Was not there? Huh ... why?

ID=560147003
Well, soul worker is not like a lie.\nit can not be helped.

ID=460147001
Well then, this is a reward.

ID=260147501
Hey! Soul worker!\nJust take a look at this!

ID=260147502
This is a picture of a camera secretly installed ....\nOh, the soul worker wore it carefully. Ha ha!

ID=260147503
From such a thing, have you seen this robot ...?\nI peeped into the union's information secretly.\nCode name "Heavy Earth Quaker"? It seems like a guy to say.

ID=260147504
Does this move with my own intention?\nIs not it that people are inside?

ID=260147505
Well, it was true. I wonder if I can bring this robot?\nI will thank you.

ID=260147506
I want to see it once.\nA moving robot that thinks on its own and interacts with it!

ID=660147501
Oh! Is it okay?\nHaha. As expected, there are only soul workers recognized by everyone!

ID=660147502
Well then it's bad, but only once again!

ID=360147501
Bring me the "body" of the code name "Heavy Earth Quaker".\nAs long as you bring it, I'll do it later.

ID=560147501
How was it? Is the robot?

ID=560147502
(He hands heavy earthquaker's body to Zenith)

ID=560147503
Wow, it's huge!\nOK, let's move it!

ID=560147504
(Zenith connects power to Heavy Earthquaker and is touching here and there)

ID=560147505
Pushing this ...? Alright, power turned on!\nHey, robot! Can you hear me?

ID=560147506
(The Heavy Earthquaker turned on, but it did not move at all)

ID=560147507
Hmm? What? Does not he speak?

ID=560147508
You do not know? Huh ... I'm disappointed.\nThis is just AI robot.

ID=560147509
It is not such a thing I expected.

ID=560147510
Well, can not it be helped?\nBut, even though you did her best, it does not change. Yes, thanks!

ID=460147501
Well, see you.

ID=260125501
Wow ... are you?

ID=260125502
It is colder here than I thought.\nWhy is it such a place ... it's all due to Jite.

ID=260125503
In betrayal of this time Ned Company, merchant association to support the union\nI decided to send a jite here.

ID=260125504
However, as it is boring that the Jite go alone, follow me ....\nBecause I was too persistent, I definitely came ... I guess it was such a place.

ID=260125505
For us, we alone, people who buy things in such a remote place with a few crew members\nAbout%username% ... I regret having been following it now.

ID=260125506
Huh

ID=260125507
... I can not afford to hang around like this.\nCan I ask you a single%username%?

ID=260125508
Actually, I have a project I had thought from before.

ID=260125509
Recently, living necessities are lacking in Crow Dream.\nBecause the monster does not seem to think about exploring,\nIt is difficult to secure goods, sometimes conflict happens.

ID=260125510
Since the area so far was relatively peaceful, there was not such a thing.\nHowever, if you get out of the west a bit, a terrible environment is spreading.

ID=260125511
So, what I thought ....\nIt is an "unmanned delivery service" utilizing robots.

ID=260125512
The current home delivery business is mainly handled by the Buckers' Hand Group ....\nThere is a problem that the expenses are high for home delivery by hand.\nIt is until then that it is not possible to do so because it is done by life.

ID=260125513
Instead of saying that it costs more for home delivery labor,\nIt costs money in terms of life-threatening.\nIf "cost of life" is not included in the cost ...?

ID=260125514
Until now I just thought about it,\nOne federation is a robot developed by Ned Company\nI heard that there is a dedicated aircraft carrying baggage.

ID=260125515
I think it certainly was called "E deliver" ....\nWill you get it?

ID=660125501
Thank you very much.\nFirst of all, please bring some bodies of that robot.

ID=660125502
I do not expect to be able to start business immediately.\nFirst of all, we need to plan how to operate and proceed with preparation.

ID=660125503
Well, then, I'm looking forward to working with you. %username%.

ID=360125501
Gunsun ... What have you done?\nIt seems that the example robot is not available yet.

ID=360125502
Please hurry as much as possible.\nIf you have that robot, you can prepare for the project.

ID=560125501
Welcome back. %username%.\nIs that an example robot?

ID=560125502
Thank you very much.\nCould you show me that robot?

ID=560125503
(Pass the robot to Yomi)

ID=460125501
Fuu ....\nAfterwards if I examine this robot and remodel it ....\nThank you very much. %username%.

ID=260126001
A bit wait!\nWell you ... recently dispatched from Grace City\nRumorous soul worker "%username%"! What?

ID=260126002
I was surprised! Because I had heard only by talk.\nI can not see you at all in such a place!

ID=260126003
Oh, I ... ... I was still introducing myself, did not I?

ID=260126004
I'm Betty! Communication soldier belonging to the Communications Section of the 3rd Western Unit of the Stary Forest Union!\nHobby is collecting information, special skill collecting information!\nMy favorite thing is gossip, the one I hate is no gossip!

ID=260126005
Yes, self-introduction is over!\nWell then, I will ask you a couple of questions from now on?

ID=260126006
Well, uh, well ... how many centimeters is your back? What is your weight?\nWhat is your favorite food and charm point?\nOh, what are you doing normally?

ID=260126007
(Through Betty's question attack)

ID=260126008
Oh my, is not I going to answer anything ...?\nOkay, I have plenty of time.\nThere is no word to give up on my dictionary.

ID=260126009
It seems to be quite confusing, so I will do as I get a little more friends.\nShall I talk about work? I have something I'd like to ask.

ID=260126010
(I will ask only the contents for the time being)

ID=260126011
What I would like to ask is information inside the Ruin Fortress.

ID=260126012
Until now as a communication soldier in the forest, water, mountains, valleys, deserts ....\nI have built a communication network in any environment,\nIt is the first time to build a communication network inside the building like this one.

ID=260126013
Apart from practicing, I tested a bit before you came,\nThe wall of this fortress ... It seems to block radio waves.

ID=260126014
So, it is a bit aggressive, but installing a communication mediation device in the passage leading to here,\nI'm trying out whether I can transmit radio waves to the outside.

ID=260126015
But you do not understand the situation inside the fortress at all?\nI might get a robot attack to make a base.\nSo I need the information inside the Ruin Fortress.

ID=260126016
Ah, but I am not seeking perfect information separately ....\nThe structure of the building, the position of the passage, the position of the blower, the position of the robot, the trap, the ideal type ... or,\nThat's enough!

ID=260126017
Oh, I inadvertently asked a private question. Tehe ♪\nHow? Will you lend me your strength?

ID=660126001
Thanks! Oh, that's right.\nJust to be sure, maybe I should meet the "Ian" of the general soldier.

ID=660126002
I did not talk much, but it looks like it was a long time ago!\nYou may want to ask the story once!

ID=660126003
If it is, you may know where information is available!\nWell then, thanks! !

ID=660126004
eh? Why will not I go directly?

ID=660126005
Ah ... ha ha ha. Actually ... I, Ian is disliked by me.\nI'm surprised to get away and get away.

ID=360126001
Your Did you feel like answering private questions? See you ....

ID=360126002
Huh? is it wrong? Well then what did you come.

ID=601260101
And to return here again ....

ID=601260102
It is very different from the past.

ID=601260103
Hmm? You are ... Is it rumorous soul worker?\nKane ... was it barrel?

ID=601260104
%username% ...?\nOh, I think the name has heard of it.

ID=601260105
So why are you here? Is it for something for me?

ID=601260106
(Ask if I know Ruin Fortress internal information to Ian)

ID=601260107
... Fufu, it seems that I have sniffed somewhere.\nI should know only about the upper part about me, did you hear that story from the superior?

ID=601260108
Well. I was a staff member of the infrastructure department involved in the construction of Ruin Fortress here.\nI was from the beginning of the construction plan here, but suddenly Ned has become fired. It is a kind of restructuring that people say.

ID=601260109
... Anyhow, because of that background I was involved in this Ruin Fortress strategy.\nFrom the point of view of the Union, I mean that we need the information that I have.

ID=601260110
... So, why do you need Ruin Fortress internal information?

ID=601260111
(Ian talks about Betty)

ID=601260112
... Hmm? Wait a minute.\nRight now, I mentioned my sinister name! What?

ID=601260113
Betty! What? Is he here? What?\nI see, I mean I've heard from him.

ID=601260114
Well, maybe ...! Betty's fingers! What?\nIf so, I can never lend the power!

ID=601260115
Do you know how hard it was because of that woman?\nEver since joining the coalition, it has always been!\nJust listening to his name, the body began to react to rejection.

ID=601260116
Do you know what he is called?\nSnake Betty, Demon Betty, Betty the Great Devil ....\nAt last the word was born "can be bettered".

ID=601260117
You can ask other people.\nJust listening to your name will make it run away.

ID=601260118
You should be careful.\nYou better not involve a woman like such a walking speaker.

ID=601260119
Are you still planning to lend a hand to him?

ID=601260120
Then, I have no information to give you.\nEnemy colleagues are enemies.

ID=601260121
... Maybe I do not think that he is an adult, but that is why he is in danger.\nI will declare it, but surely I will be grateful to me later.

ID=601260122
Besides, I do not have time to talk about it all the time.\nDue to the sudden restructuring, I can not collect the luggage of the accommodation.

ID=601260123
Well ... It is a situation I do not know whether the lodging itself is still left, not to mention luggage.\nI think that I will check it directly.

ID=601260124
Anyway, that's it.\nI am busy.

ID=560126001
How was it? What is Ian?\nAs I expected, he knew something, did not he?

ID=560126002
Well ... I was talking about myself like that.

ID=560126003
Feelingly I want to go now and say a lot,\nWell I have to give you a chance.\nI will give Ian a chance.

ID=460126001
Can you tell Ian to put out information before going directly?

ID=460126002
Oh, that going directly, of course, bringing souvenirs as well.\nIan will take her own secret that I do not even know, with both hands.

ID=460126003
If you tell me this much, you surely understand.\nIt is not a bad person.\nI understood? Well then, I asked.

ID=260126501
By the way, what happened to Betty 's case?\n... What? Come directly ...? That woman ... is it serious?

ID=260126502
I seem to misunderstand, but he is scared and not avoiding it.\nI hate it, so I avoid it!

ID=260126503
So, I will not be involved this time as well!\nI can go out with you!

ID=260126504
... What is it?\nDo not look with such eyes.

ID=260126505
... Was found was found! There is no ginger.\nRuin Fortress internal information, right? It's only a little.\nHowever, it may be somewhat different.

ID=260126506
It is also true that I have been around for a long time since I came out.\nIt is not surprising that the internal structure changes.

ID=260126507
The internal information data of Ruin Fortress is in the central control room\nIt is highly likely that it is stored as confidential information on the main server.

ID=260126508
Although there is no possibility of being wrong,\nI do not think it will be easy to change the storage method that lasted for years.

ID=260126509
Go to the central control room and check it.\nWhen I was working, I was connected to the main server\nI planned to place a computer terminal.

ID=660126501
You should be able to obtain Ruin Fortress related information from that terminal.

ID=660126502
... If you do not understand well, bring it.\nBecause I extract relevant information.

ID=360126501
Check the central control room.

ID=360126502
No way ... I can not use computers.

ID=601265201
Are you back already?

ID=601265202
It seems I brought it properly.

ID=601265203
This is ... Ruin Fortress's guidebook? I do not need it ....\nHmm? This ... Lucy's instructions ...? I do not need this.\nOther than that ....

ID=601265204
Is this ... Ruin Fortress design drawing?\nIn this case ... it will be okay to hand it over. It was a hard time.

ID=601265205
... By the way Betty guy, quietly?\nThat gossip madman flying around all the year worries that it is so quiet.

ID=601265206
... No, forget your words now.\nWhen this story enters his ears, it will bloom many times and spread.

ID=601265207
Yeah ... There is a way for Betty to be called a daemon.

ID=601265208
Communists are duties that raise sounds no matter what power they boast.\nI always have to carry a heavy wireless terminal, and on the day I started installing communication equipment ....

ID=601265209
... Carrying communication cables with their own weight,\nI come back and forth to the distant distance.

ID=601265210
But the Betty guy gets to do it casually.\nThe members who saw it called A Vetivera with a sense of fear.

ID=601265211
Well, now you must have that demonic character\nI feel like I'm saying something good, though. Whew ... ....

ID=601265212
You'd better go soon.\nWhen you are tingling, all things that do not exist in "Betty Bear" will be revealed.

ID=560126501
Ah! It is good!

ID=560126502
I was expecting to go directly if I was a minute late.

ID=560126503
How was it? Did you get the information?

ID=560126504
(Pass Ruin Fortress design drawing to Betty)

ID=460126501
Hmm, information of Ruin Fortress ...\nYou seem to have brought it properly.

ID=460126502
According to this drawing, it is not only a passageway\nIt seems that you can also use air outlets and drains.

ID=460126503
... Yeah, that's perfect.

ID=460126504
I'm thinking of posting some information you gotten.\nWell, I will write as well as possible! Hehe

ID=460126505
Having said that, please also interview the next one!

ID=260127001
Oh, it was just right. There is something I want to ask.

ID=260127002
You told me before? I came to pick up the luggage that remained in the dormitory.

ID=260127003
That ... ... Although predictions were generally followed ....\nAfter all it was nothing. I was tidied up clean.

ID=260127004
However, it seems that it is not gonna be fun if all is thrown away.

ID=260127005
I confirmed it from the entrance of the dormitory,\nThere is a guidance to keep the neglected baggage in an employee common repository ....

ID=260127006
I do not ask for it, but on the way to the central control room\nThere is a security robot called "Heavy Sentry\

ID=260127007
It has the access key of the depository.\nWill you bring it with me?

ID=660127001
It should be on the way to the central control room.\nDo not be discouraged as it is a sturdy person.\nWell ... I do not care much.

ID=360127001
Please be safe! My package!

ID=560127001
How was it? Did you find the key?

ID=560127002
(Pass the storage depot access key to Ian)

ID=560127003
Oh, wait a moment.

ID=560127004
(Ian got a key on the computer on the spot and started looking for something)

ID=560127005
Sounds like that ...! Why not! What?

ID=460127001
......

ID=260127501
Where the hell have you disappeared?\nIn the announcement of the dormitory, it certainly is in the official storage.

ID=260127502
Oh no ... no.\nAs this is the case, you have to look for another place.

ID=260127503
Sorry, could you ask me another one?\nThe guardian of the security robot has a guy called "Sentry Commander"\nI want him to take away the secret key store access key from him.

ID=660127501
Sorry.

ID=660127502
I do not know where the baggage went,\nIf you were to transport it to another place ... it would be a confidential store.

ID=660127503
Robots and people will fail, though.\nWell, this is a friend's selling out.

ID=660127504
Then get the access key of the security office from the Sentry Commander.

ID=360127501
ask! It's my collection ... collection of life! Please be safe!

ID=560127501
Oh! Did you find the access key?

ID=560127502
(When I handed the security depository access key to Ian, I quickly inserted it into the terminal and started searching)

ID=560127503
I will ask ...! !

ID=560127504
Oh! This is ...! ... Hey, what is this! What?\n"Inappropriate books incinerated"! What?\nOh, did you burn all that! What?

ID=460127501
(Ian sat down like a sudden weakness)

ID=460127502
Haha ... oh, my twenty years ....\nThe collection "play guy" took over 20 years ... ... Oh ....

ID=460127503
At last I thought I finally found out,\nWas it eventually turned into this ...?

ID=260128001
Oh, hello ....

ID=260128002
......

ID=260128003
Excuse me. I have recently fallen asleep ....

ID=260128004
......

ID=260128005
Ha ha! Excuse me.\nI stayed up all night yesterday ... I'm sleepy .... Fua.

ID=260128006
Actually, I brought it from Grace City some days ago.\nPart of the oil and fuel for the cold district was stolen.

ID=260128007
Fortunately there was not much,\nSomehow I do not even find clues from the criminal ... / /.

ID=260128008
...... Zzz.

ID=260128009
... Ha! Excuse me. Am I sleeping?

ID=260128010
Even if it says how many things are not,\nI can not defend the warehouse by myself alone ....\nHowever, it is high to hire mercenaries ... and so on.

ID=260128011
Ha ... There is no body in this way.

ID=260128012
Can you keep it a bit easier ...?

ID=260128013
Oh, by the way, I heard from the Union for a while ago,\nI heard there are robots made here for security purposes.

ID=260128014
Excuse me, could you get the robot?

ID=660128001
Thank you very much.\nIt will be appreciated if you get it in a little hurry.\nIt is almost time ... the limit ... Zzz.

ID=360128001
......

ID=360128002
... Ha! Welcome back.\nDid you get the robot?

ID=360128003
I am sorry but I'd like ... please.\nI will collapse as it is.

ID=560128001
Is cheers for good work.\nDid you have a robot ...?

ID=560128002
(Show Yomi Sentry body)

ID=560128003
This is a security robot ....\nThank you very much.

ID=460128001
Well ...

ID=460128002
... ... Well ~.

ID=460128003
Um,%username% ...?

ID=460128004
How do I move this ...?

ID=260128501
(The expression of Yomi is dark, asking what happened)

ID=260128502
Ha, in fact ... there is another storm in the warehouse ....

ID=260128503
The guard robot I should have protected the warehouse,\nAfter confirming this morning, the robot was broken at a corner.

ID=260128504
Those in the warehouse are the same as before,\nOil-related products were carried away.

ID=260128505
Fuu ... until you destroy that big robot\nWhat are you aiming at ...?

ID=260128506
Anyhow, that robot seems to be useless.\nMovement is also slow ... And, with that hand, I will be able to catch a strawberry ....

ID=260128507
%username% Can I ask you again?

ID=260128508
I'm sorry but please get another robot.\nUnlike the current robot, it is saved when there are robots that can move quickly.

ID=660128501
So, thank you.

ID=360128501
Haa ... It is a big deficit. Completely ....

ID=360128502
Is cheers for good work.\nDid you get the robot?

ID=360128503
Oh, it still costs me?\nWell then it's time for the business to go up.

ID=560128501
Oh, is that ...?

ID=560128502
(Show the blade wolf body to Yomi)

ID=560128503
Here, this is an animal type robot ...! What?

ID=560128504
Wow ....

ID=560128505
(Ask if Yomi did not like it)

ID=560128506
Huh! What? Oh, I'm sorry.\nI liked it very much. Thank you very much. %username%.

ID=460128501
Wow ....

ID=460128502
Oh, this is not the case.\nI have to start the robot immediately.

ID=460128503
Thank you,%username%.

ID=260129001
Oh,%username%. Did not you see Jite?

ID=260129002
... I am worried a little what I am doing these days.

ID=260129003
Who was influenced by Grace City, suddenly began researching the robot of Ned Company ....\nWhen I pulled the electricity from various places,\nThe building of the coalition was about to catch fire.

ID=260129004
Fortunately, I am glad that I was close ....

ID=260129005
Um,%username%. I'm sorry, but what are you planning to meet the jite ....\nNo, can you ask me a story once and for what?

ID=660129001
I have a bad feeling for some reason ....\nI feel something is going to happen. It is a woman 's intuition.

ID=360129001
Even if I listen, I will be cheated.\nBut I think it's okay if%username%.

ID=360129002
So, thank you.

ID=601290101
Goodbye! ! Oh! Is not%username% san!

ID=601290102
Huh? What are you doing these days?\nmy mother! Why are you looking at such eyes?\nI'm not making illegal weapons ~!

ID=601290103
Oh yeah, maybe it was said by Yomi?\nI also felt a bit thin, but I heard that someone from Yomi cares.

ID=601290104
... Do you like my thing?

ID=601290105
......

ID=601290106
Ha ha ha! JOKES! joke!\nThat iron woman does not exist.

ID=601290107
(Yomi's sigh seems to come to be heard)

ID=601290108
Well, that 's it. I was studying technology development personally.\nOh, it was just right. You came all the way so may I ask a favor?

ID=601290109
My electricity of my own generator "Dorushiru" seems to be missing.\nFor facilities of this size, there should be a corresponding power room.\nI wonder if I can pull electricity from there ....

ID=601290110
If you know even the location of the high voltage cable ... well then it is.

ID=601290111
Betty ... was it?\nAccording to her, a soldier like Ian knows well.\nCan not you ask me a little?

ID=601290201
Hmm? What is it this time?

ID=601290202
Power cable?\nWell ... I do not know the details, too.\nElectric construction is out of the field.

ID=601290203
Power cables tend to be neglected,\nIt's important information handled as confidential information.\nIt was not anyone who could easily get it.

ID=601290204
Electric power cables are stretched everywhere in the facility.\nThat alone is enough to understand the structure's outline.

ID=601290205
If you really want to know ...\nThere is no choice but to look for it in the main computer inside the central control room.

ID=560129001
Welcome back! What is the location of the cable?

ID=460129001
Th-This is ...!

ID=460129002
... What is it?\nComplex map ... Ss ....

ID=460129003
Oh, is this a cable placement diagram?\nHa ha ha, I see! Thank you,%username%!

ID=260129501
Oh,%username%!

ID=260129502
You brought me the layout diagram of this front cable?\nI saw it and connected it to the power cable.\nBut, apparently electricity does not pass ....

ID=260129503
Probably, there was a problem with the power control unit in the main power station ... and so on.

ID=260129504
Please!\nDoes not it start the power control device of the power cable in the main power room!

ID=660129501
Ha ha ha! I thought you would lend me a hand!\nAfter all following%username% comes and it is the right answer!

ID=660129502
(I tried asking what to do if it was not good)

ID=660129503
If it was useless ... I will have you do it until I can! Ha ha ha!

ID=660129504
......

ID=660129505
... It's a joke! joke!\nAnyway, I have another purpose, so I'll ask you to do it!

ID=360129501
(Jite seems to be busy)

ID=560129501
Oh! Tired!

ID=560129502
It looks like electric power has just recovered.\nAs might be expected,%username%!

ID=560129503
(Suddenly there was a strange sound from the generator of the Jite, and it stopped as it was)

ID=460129501
About ... Doctor? What's wrong?\nPlease wait for a while,%username%.\nIt sounds like there was a problem with the generator.

ID=260130001
(I checked the generator with Jite, but I was sighing because I did not find any abnormality in this regard)

ID=260130002
Huh

ID=260130003
This is ... it seemed like something had happened.\n%username%.

ID=260130004
Sure there is no doubt that electricity is coming to the generator ....\nIf there is no problem with the generator ... it may be a problem with the voltage of the power cable.

ID=260130005
I'm sorry, can not you check the main power room again?

ID=660130001
My expectation is that the robot or something caught on the cable,\nIt was a short circuit at a suddenly high voltage.

ID=660130002
Even if you are here, I do not know the cause, so I'd like you to check it directly!

ID=360130001
While%username% is checking the main power room,\nI am going to check the generator. Thank you!

ID=560130001
Good work today! I confirmed that power returned!

ID=560130002
But what on earth was it a problem?

ID=560130003
(I told the Jite that Dominia was charging frequently in the main power room)

ID=460130001
Ha ha ha! Ss that I thought it would be such a thing!\nBut it was good. If there is a change in the voltage, the machine breaks down,\nThere 's got to burn the worst.

ID=460130002
But, Ned Company made it sturdy, right? Ha ha ha!

ID=460130003
Thank you very much!\nAlso, since you do not know when robots use power cables,\nIt is necessary to install a transformer.

ID=260130501
You're going to go toward the underground shuttle aisle?\nBecause I know everything, it is no use cheating.

ID=260130502
So, may I just wish for a moment?

ID=260130503
While watching the design drawing that I brought before,\nI installed a communication connector.

ID=260130504
However, although there is no problem in other areas, only the person in the underground shuttle passageway,\nIt sounds almost like a blocked wall, radio waves do not pass at all.

ID=260130505
I tried to ask the crew to confirm it,\nI told you that big robot ...? "Earthquaker" ...?

ID=260130506
Anyway, saying that it was not possible to confirm with that.\nSo, I'd like you to hit that earthquaker ...\nCan you do it?

ID=660130501
Earthquaker is quite big.\nDo not let your guard down.

ID=360130501
There are many underground shuttle passages, so be careful.

ID=560130501
%username%! Welcome back!

ID=560130502
It seems that radio waves passed safely.\nAfter all it was a correct answer as you asked!

ID=460130501
Oh, that's right. Previously, you met a near soul worker in the main power room, did not he?

ID=460130502
How was the appearance? What is your character? How old are you?

ID=460130503
No, in that case it may be better to write articles for them!

ID=460130504
As far as watched with surveillance cameras, it was a nice style girl, is not it?\nSuch a person is an enemy deserves to be listed in my gossip magazine.

ID=460130505
I wrote an article on a model of Vesi that attacked Ned Company of Grace City before.\nA woman like poison. In its fascinating eyes ... a sensual body line ....

ID=460130506
That time I was madly selling!\nBecause gossip magazines were not enough.

ID=460130507
So why ...%username%.\nWhen I go to see Near soul workers later, please take me as well!\nIs not it? Please take me there!

ID=260131001
Oh,%username%! !

ID=260131002
Here, civilians manage part of the surveillance camera to support the coalition.\nBank of Odon.\nI can not say it is a big voice, but in reality he did some transaction with that person.

ID=260131003
I was worried about the image capturing the figure of Near Soul Worker\nCan you sell only a part! Hehe

ID=260131004
(I will ask if I can talk about such things)

ID=260131005
If you were you, do not talk to others.\nBecause I handle gossip expertly ... I have confidence in seeing people.\nYou absolutely will not give out a secret.

ID=260131006
Regardless of the secret goodness or badness .... Giggle

ID=260131007
Previously, similar information has been circulated before publication,\nLooking at the place without any blame ....\nMaybe my fans have a great one? Hehe

ID=260131008
Or maybe it's a gossip of this degree that you keep your eyes closed?\nI do not put military secrets ... / /.\nMy motto is "Interesting"!

ID=260131009
That's it! There is something I came up with,\nCan you lend me a hand?

ID=660131001
Besides the shuttle passage area Earthquaker,\nThere is a robot like an earthworm called "Ironworm".\nThe street is hard for me because of that.

ID=660131002
Like other robots it will be easy to show up "normally"\nThey come from beneath, right?

ID=660131003
Once I had the connector become a mess.\nEven though it is higher than my salary ....

ID=660131004
In that!\nWill you beat that iron worm?

ID=660131005
Nice to meet you.

ID=360131001
I often see it in the shuttle passage area, but I usually dive below.\nIf you make a noise, it comes from over there. Thanks!

ID=560131001
%username%, welcome home!

ID=560131002
It was a long way ago ...\nDid you say that you stopped pretending and came back ...?

ID=560131003
... Why not? I said it's a joke! Hehe\nOkay, I can devote myself to my main job as well! Thanks!

ID=460131001
Betty. Oh, did you also join%username%?

ID=460131002
Oh, Mr. Odon! What happened?

ID=460131003
Excuse me.\nBetty has bad news.

ID=460131004
Huh? Bad ... news?

ID=460131005
Yes. I was watching the shuttle passage area with a camera,\nA huge robot similar to iron worm appeared,\nI broke the connector.

ID=460131006
What, hey! !\nAnyway ... I was struggling to set up! !

ID=260131501
......

ID=260131502
Even though I had such a hard time ... This is too bad.

ID=260131503
%username% ... You already know?

ID=660131501
A huge earthworm robot than that Ironworm ....\nDo not know the prototype too Kekyon Kecchon!\nNo ... In this case, extinguish the existence itself!

ID=360131501
Haa ... this is what ....\nI also have to install again.

ID=360131502
......

ID=360131503
... I will run away.

ID=560131501
Haa ... Oh, welcome back.

ID=560131502
What happened to the giant iron worm?

ID=460131501
Yes ... I will not come out anymore ... is it?

ID=460131502
Huh ... the living energy was lost. Hey,%username%.

ID=460131503
If you tell me the ideal type, I think that the strength will definitely return! !

ID=260132001
Hello,%username%.\nSince I came here, I did not have time to talk.

ID=260132002
Ruin Fortress ... It is a mysterious place.

ID=260132003
In such a remote place, to build such a huge facility unnoticed ...\nBesides, robots and power facilities here can only be said as truly.

ID=260132004
To make such a facility with human power ....\nSo, was the information control of the Ned Company solid?

ID=260132005
Oops ... rude ... From such a thing,\nYou know that I contracted with the Star Forest Alliance this time, right?

ID=260132006
Union also suddenly decided to dispatch to Ruin Fortress,\nThere seems to be something that is missing in various ways.\nTherefore, we decided to support logistics control this time.

ID=260132007
What is to say instead,\nWith loveless information at Ruin Fortress\nPartial surveillance The control of the camera was delegated.

ID=260132008
Thanks to that, you no longer need to install the camera secretly,\nThere are some problems which can not be solved by our strength alone ....

ID=260132009
Would you please lend me some power if you like?

ID=660132001
Thank you very much. It is not difficult.\nAsking is the destruction of a certain robot.

ID=660132002
Something covers the screen of the surveillance camera a while ago.\nAs it suddenly appeared, I could not confirm the appearance ....\nI think that it is probably a robot.

ID=660132003
Please.\nSomehow it only appears on my camera, so I am curious.

ID=360132001
Hmm ... Because I have some time to spare,\nYou can do it at your own pace.

ID=560132001
Welcome back,%username%.\nWhat happened to the example case?

ID=560132002
"Assault Spider" ... There was such a robot.

ID=460132001
Hmm, that shadow like a spider in the camera monitoring area ....

ID=460132002
Thank you very much.\nI am sorry that the first request here is dangerous.

ID=460132003
From now on, you will be asking%username% in various ways. Haha.

ID=460132004
... Let's meet again.

ID=260132501
Hello,%username%.\nThere was something I just wanted to ask.

ID=260132502
As you may already know,\nDo you know a robot called Sentry to protect Yomi's warehouse?

ID=260132503
I heard that someone handed robot to Mr. Yomi,\nI think that it is quite an interesting idea.

ID=260132504
Until now, I hired mercenaries to protect the warehouse,\nI thought that it would be more efficient if you let the robot protect you like Yomi.

ID=260132505
Unlike people, if you do not have enough fuel you will not complain and follow orders.\nI do not have any more security guards.

ID=260132506
So I requested it,\nWould you mind bringing similar robots?

ID=660132501
Thank you very much.\nAs a result of examination, there is a humanoid robot with a large physique ....\nI think that is good.

ID=660132502
Because performance seemed better than Mr. Yomi's robot.

ID=660132503
So, thank you. %username%.

ID=360132501
Oh? You still have to come.

ID=360132502
It seems that the robot often appears in the shuttle passage area.

ID=360132503
If you can, do not hurt so much ... and.\nIs the first impression important? Haha.

ID=560132501
Is cheers for good work.\nHave you got an example robot?

ID=560132502
(Show Earthquaquer body to Odon)

ID=460132501
Hmm ... Good. There seems to be no scratches.\nFirst of all, let's test it. Thank you very much.

ID=460132502
(Ask Odon about the test)

ID=460132503
Oh, I did not explain so.

ID=460132504
Actually, the efficiency of mercenaries used for security\nI tried to test each of the robot's efficiencies.

ID=460132505
Of course they protested.\nSince I worked hard so far, I told you to arrange for another job,\nApparently it seems he hurt his pride ....

ID=460132506
So, with the robot that they brought with%username%\nI decided to carry out a battle test.

ID=460132507
As it is a test, there is no concern for life,\nSince it is unknown how much performance will be demonstrated,\nIt's half expected.

ID=460132508
Then we will test this robot.\nLet's talk about the results when we meet next time. Okay ....

ID=260133001
%username%, I have a favor to ask!

ID=260133002
When you go to the underground shuttle passage area, there are robots called ghosts.\nThe robot 's tentacle resembles this cable.\nWill you bring it with me?

ID=260133003
With this communication connector installation,\nYou used a lot of network cables.

ID=260133004
Ten troops also prepared the troops, but little remains.

ID=260133005
In short, it's not enough!

ID=260133006
I asked for an additional request, but it took me a week to get it ....\nSo I thought I'd temporarily use the ghost tentacle as a cable.

ID=260133007
Can you hurry up as soon as possible?\nYou have to go to another connector to set up the connector.

ID=660133001
Oh yeah, it's not a matter of cabling anything?\nThere is something I want you to protect. Remember it.

ID=660133002
Cables are white and orange copper wire, orange copper wire, white and green copper wire, blue copper wire,\nThere are white and blue copper wire, green copper wire, white and brown copper wire, brown copper wire.

ID=660133003
Remember it!\nGood? Other than that is useless!

ID=360133001
I will say it again. Remember it properly.

Cables are white and orange copper wire, orange copper wire, white and green copper wire, blue copper wire,\nThere are white and blue copper wire, green copper wire, white and brown copper wire, brown copper wire.

ID=560133001
%username%!\nWere there cables?

ID=560133002
(Show cable to Betty)

ID=460133001
... This is an unusable cable,\n... This is not even a network cable!

ID=460133002
Oh, but it looks like you can use it!

ID=460133003
Did you say that? Remember the color of the cable properly.\nWell, there seems to be several cables to use,\nIt seems that we can overcome tomorrow by this.

ID=460133004
Please firmly next time?

ID=260133501
Hey, is it okay?

ID=260133502
There is something I want to ask a bit.\nIs there time?

ID=260133503
When I worked here earlier, what told me there were friends ... Do you remember?

ID=260133504
After I became fired, I can no longer contact you ....\nI'm curious what you are doing.

ID=260133505
The contact point seems to have changed, and there is no news.\nOr ... I feel like being treated like it did not exist in the first place ....

ID=260133506
Perhaps it went to other areas.\nWill not you search with me?

ID=660133501
All right! I thought about doing something by myself, but ... it is stuck.\nIt is reassuring if you have any.\nLet's investigate from personnel-related data first!

ID=660133502
Is that ... Jesse said?\nI guess you know something if that AI.

ID=660133503
Let's listen together.

ID=360133501
I can not grasp the disappointment of my friend ....\nSince I could not be contacted shortly before my dismissal, I can not get in touch with him since then.

ID=601335101
Rashay Masse. %username%.\nWho is that person deska?

ID=601335102
What is it? Is this Jessie?\nOh, maybe it is Lucy's replica AI?

ID=601335103
Well, now I'm Lucy's fake, Mattaka! What?\nCheck the target Cao! Mass!\nConfirm with Ian who was laid off due to negligence of duty! Mass entered into alert!

ID=601335104
... What does AI get angry.\nLet's cancel what told replica.\nIf you are a person you believe.

ID=601335105
You know you can do work?\nSo, there was a request.\nThis name is ... I do not know anything?

ID=601335106
... at all, Kiotsukete Yone.\nLiberating warning against Ian Simas.\nSearch on the name written on this paper Death?

ID=601335107
Start searching for the requested person Simas.\nNed Industry affiliation, chief responsible for mechanic AI.\nCheck the position and status of the person.

ID=601335108
I found out Mashita. The current position of the target ... "Unknown" Death.\nThis data is Mondez one month before you get fired.

ID=601335109
what? wait a minute ...!\nHe said ... McWoz is missing?

ID=601335110
That should have been ... until I was fired.\nHave you looked closely, did you really look for it?\nThat ... ... There was a mistake in the name ...?

ID=601335111
In the information of the data, it is registered as the content of the previous Imasu.

ID=601335112
... Really.

ID=601335113
Hey,%username% ... There is one trust.\nWill you pick up the AI ​​chip from the auto punisher without asking anything?

ID=560133501
Did you come? AI Chip Is your company?

ID=560133502
(Ian gives the auto punisher's AI chip)

ID=460133501
There is somewhat things to check. Please wait a while.

ID=460133502
There is something I want to ask a little more.

ID=260134001
Fuu, is not here ...?

ID=260134002
(I asked what happened to Ian)

ID=260134003
Actually, on the AI ​​chip I asked you,\nThere was special information not known to others by others.

ID=260134004
Do you know cryptography?

ID=260134005
You do not seem to know.\nSimply put, it is a cipher that was used before a certain king died.

ID=260134006
Cryptography is a cipher that replaces strings according to specific rules.\nMac was entering a cryptographic diary, besides a boring task.

ID=260134007
... It's AI chip for all robots that he created.

ID=260134008
The AI ​​chip that you got it also wrote this.

ID=260134009
"March 24"\n"During the AI ​​test of the auto punisher, there is a rumbling in the basement.\nIt seems that it has occurred frequently recently. "

ID=260134010
"April 30"\n"The auto-punisher's AI test and adjustment has been completed.\nHowever, we will not stop the rumbling from the basement. "

ID=260134011
"The bad feeling will not go away ... If I do not finish my work in a hurry ..."\n"Hurry up - only the enhanced version of the Punisher series will be delivered by this month"

ID=260134012
There was no earthquake when I was there.\nAnyway, it seems that there is something wrong here.\nI need to investigate more.

ID=260134013
%username%, can we ask you again?\nWhen you go to the underground arsenal, you should have an auto punisher and other robots.

ID=260134014
Bring the AI ​​chip from the robot.\nIt was created after completion of the auto punching machine.\nSurely another content is written.

ID=660134001
Sorry.\nTry searching the underground arsenal. Be careful!

ID=360134001
Try searching the underground arsenal. It should be a stronger robot than an autopanisher. Do not be discouraged.

ID=560134001
%username%!\nI'm glad you are fine. Have you got AI chips?

ID=560134002
(Passing a new AI chip to Ian)

ID=460134001
Is this the AI ​​chip you got?

ID=460134002
Alright, please wait a moment.\nAnalyze and teach the results soon!

ID=260134501
Strange information is outrageous ....

ID=260134502
"June 3"\n"There is something interfering with the Heavy Punisher's AI program.\nIt seems that many unexplained problems are occurring frequently. "

ID=260134503
"August 8"\n"... It is decided to restart the prototype test with the command from above.\nWhy suddenly ... "

ID=260134504
"Recently, it seems to be related to a series of cases occurring in the base ..."\n"I have to think about running away from here ..."

ID=260134505
Hmm, I do not really understand.\nHowever, it is only certain that something has happened.\n%username%, I need another information.

ID=260134506
Please go to Jessie again and check the work of Mac.\nCertainly, I think that I had several projects besides the Punisher series ....

ID=660134501
Anyway, I asked him what kind of robot he was making,\nBring me the robot's AI chip.

ID=360134501
Mack ... what the heck was that ...?

ID=601345101
Lassay. %username%.\nToday is Watts Happen Deska?

ID=601345102
(Ask Jesse about the robots that Macwoz was involved with)

ID=601345103
I received a request of the same category a while ago.\nRegister the contents. We are waiting for a while.

ID=601345104
......

ID=601345105
Confirmation of Request contents.\nStaff member number [N.In - 049932]\nWork information Punisher series Contents other than robot are in Cancel state.

ID=601345106
The remaining information is the prototype of "Z Project"\nOnly indefinite information that it was involved in "Heavy Siege Protection" Death.

ID=601345107
Any other necessary information is Arimasuka?

ID=601345108
Not to be disgusted, this is disappointing.

ID=560134501
(Pass Ii chip damaged Ian)

ID=460134501
This ... There are quite a lot of scratches.\nIt seems that he fought quite a lot.\nI hope the data is safe.

ID=460134502
But it was something you brought me.\nPlease wait a while.

ID=260135001
Clearly, it seems that part of the data is damaged.\nSince the encryption is also corrupted, it is impossible to analyze everything ....

ID=260135002
For the time being, this is the part I could analyze.

ID=260135003
"September 2"\n"A total of three prototypes were produced.\n□□□□□ is ... □ □ □ □ It seems to be prepared for something "

ID=260135004
"October 5" "It is too late to escape from □□□.."\n"There is nothing I can do now, is it a machine-driven god ... or?\nI wish I had lived until then ... "

ID=260135005
"God of mechanized" ...?\nWait, you've heard from Mac.\nReplacing this with another word ....

ID=260135006
Really! It's another project! !\nNed Company's super huge robot project\n"Deus · Ex · Makina"! !

ID=260135007
It seems that it was a story that it was not for Vesi or Soul Junk ....\nI heard that the project has become a blank paper ...\nWas not it secretly made! What?

ID=260135008
As there is a record of "machinist god" on the AI ​​chip,\nDeus · Ex · Makina should also have cryptography.\nCan you ask for it?

ID=660135001
The cipher should be in the back of the arsenal that built the robot.

ID=360135001
Leaving a message like this ....\nWhat on earth is going on?\nNed company ... what can they do ...?

ID=560135001
Were you safe? How was the robot?

ID=560135002
(Ian tells Deus Ex Makina and hands high performance AI chip)

ID=460135001
This ... It's OK.

ID=460135002
Anyway, first from analysis. Please wait.

ID=460135003
Well ....

ID=460135004
... It seems to be strange this time. This ... so ....

ID=460135005
......

ID=460135006
OK, you can do it!\nFuu, this time it was a cryptic crypt.

ID=460135007
There was also damage this time, and I could not analyze everything.\nHowever, let's check only the part that could be analyzed.

ID=460135008
"December 24, □□□□ Fail"\n"The thread of the mechanical device is broken,\n□ □ that leads us all to □ □ now appear as a devil "

ID=460135009
"The goddess of fate never smiled at us."\n"If ... Ian wanted to say this ... □ □ □ □.\nA little to say ... It was late ... "

ID=460135010
... Well, is this the end? Damn it!\nSuch a conclusion, I will never admit it!

ID=460135011
Bakayarou ...!\nDo not leave me like a will!

ID=460135012
Wait ... are not they? I have not finished yet!\nSorry, I have something to look up on alone.\n%username%, Let's meet again later!

ID=260135501
Hello.

ID=260135502
Robot I brought you before ... "Earthquaker" was it?

ID=260135503
Results of battle test with mercenaries came out.

ID=260135504
......

ID=260135505
... It was a very bad result.

ID=260135506
No, the mercenaries I hired were competent ....\nYou can say that. my mother.

ID=260135507
Regardless of the result, I have noticed this time.\nIt is wasteful to keep competent mercenaries in a simple warehouse number.

ID=260135508
There, I have a favor to ask,\nCould you bring another robot?

ID=660135501
I thought that I would accept.\nThis time is a robot called "War Solver".

ID=660135502
As I looked at the surveillance camera, I confirmed that it came in and out with an arsenal.\nA somewhat dubious machine was with me, but please be careful.

ID=660135503
So, thank you.

ID=360135501
"War solver" is in the underground weapons repository.\nThere are other dangerous robots, so take care.\nAh ... it may be unnecessary care. my mother.

ID=560135501
Is cheers for good work.\nDid you secure war solver?

ID=560135502
(Show Warsolver body to Odon)

ID=460135501
Hmm, if this is the case ....\nThe state is not bad, and it will not be done easily like the last time.

ID=460135502
Thank you,%username%.\nI would like to do a second test soon.

ID=260136001
I was waiting. %username%.

ID=260136002
Fortunately the War solver I brought last time,\nIt left excellent results.

ID=260136003
I had a mercenary counterattack,\nIt was a mistake performance with Earthquaker.

ID=260136004
Thanks to this, it is now time to dismiss mercenaries.

ID=260136005
Even from%username%, do you look me ruthless?\nWell, there are parts that do it on purpose.\nTo tell the truth, their labor costs are also quite good.

ID=260136006
Compared to personnel expenses, the maintenance cost of the robot is many times cheaper.\nHousing, monthly salary, everything else in food expenses ....\nGiven its expenses, it is obvious which one to use.

ID=260136007
And there were others who steal things from the warehouse ....\nIt was a place I wanted to dismiss quickly,\nIn consideration of various circumstances it became no accusation.

ID=260136008
Anyway ... I got a War Solver\nThank you very much.

ID=260136009
... By the way, there is something a little stuck.

ID=260136010
As you know, Warsolver has only a shield, is not it?

ID=260136011
Oh, of course if the battle power is as much as War Solver\nYou may not need to have another weapon.

ID=260136012
Considering the original purpose, in security,\nIt is also important to give a sense of intimidation that prevents crime before it happens.

ID=260136013
The current War Solver will receive the impression specialized in defense, right?\nWhether it is somewhat unsatisfactory to give an intimidating feeling ....

ID=260136014
So, we need to change the image a bit.

ID=260136015
We have already cooperated enough,\nMay I ask you only one more thing?

ID=660136001
Thank you very much.\nI was disappointed to hesitate to refuse this time. my mother.

ID=660136002
Will you bring something that could be a weapon of War Solver?

ID=660136003
If you have a big shield, you have no weapons to suit it ....

ID=660136004
I checked that there seems to be a robot with a huge sword behind the arsenal.

ID=660136005
It was left in a place like a scrap.\nI think that it is probably still intact.

ID=660136006
Perhaps battles like the time of War Solver will not happen ....\nIt is not very difficult contents.

ID=360136001
You are still here.\nAlthough I said that it is not difficult, careful preparation is necessary for emergency.

ID=360136002
Well, then, I'm looking forward to working with you.

ID=560136001
I was waiting,%username%.

ID=560136002
Did you get the weapons of War Solver?

ID=560136003
(Show weapons to Odon)

ID=460136001
Hmm, it is not bad.\nThe shades are flashy a little, but it will be okay if this is the case.

ID=460136002
It took more time than I thought.\nWhat happened?

ID=460136003
Was Siegproto working?\n... I'm sorry.\nWhen I confirmed it was not working ....

ID=460136004
Anyway, I'm coming back safely and I have more than anything else. My mother ....

ID=260136501
By the way, how much money is Ruin Fortress here\nHave you thought about what was made?

ID=260136502
......

ID=260136503
Yes ... I also have no idea how much investment was made.

ID=260136504
When it becomes such a huge building, it will be an astronomical investment.\nOf course Ned Company, there was no reference to this matter anywhere.

ID=260136505
No matter how much it is a company,\nIf you use this kind of funds,\nI think there is a problem somewhere.

ID=260136506
In my forecast ....\nAre we our "Crow Dream Alliance Bank" ...?

ID=260136507
If our bank is involved,\nThe upper part is considered to be involved.

ID=260136508
But even if we publish such contents to the public,\nIt will not fit easily.\nIf you bring somewhat truthfulness, it will be crushed without doubt.

ID=260136509
Therefore, I have a favor to%username%.

ID=260136510
Together with me, the Allied Bank that was introduced to Ruin Fortress\nDo not track the source of funds?

ID=660136501
Thank you very much.\nTo be honest, I wanted to investigate this case alone.\nI was insufficient by myself.

ID=660136502
Let's start with listening in the meantime.

ID=660136503
According to Mr. Betty, it is a member of a coalition that some people worked at the time of construction here ....\nCould you ask him about the funds that flowed to Ruin Fortress?

ID=360136501
(Ask how much Odon and Betty exchanged)

ID=360136502
Haha, that's right. There is not so much.\nHowever, we offer several gossip members.

ID=360136503
Oh, do not worry.\nBecause I'm not talking about%username%. Haha.

ID=601365101
%username%? What happened?

ID=601365102
(Ian inquires about the scale of funds invested in Ruin Fortress Construction)

ID=601365103
Fund? I do not know anything, do you?\nIt certainly worked here, but I have never done business accounting.

ID=601365104
... And do you think that such a thing can be done?

ID=601365105
......

ID=601365106
... It is easy to be convinced.

ID=601365107
Anyway, if you are investigating financial affairs, it is useless to ask me.

ID=601365108
But if the project is related to funds, is not it stored on the computer?

ID=601365109
Documents ... Perhaps when they ran away\nI guess they have all been burned ....

ID=601365110
The data may have been erased,\nTrying to leave valuable things, can it be possible to say that it is ugly?

ID=601365111
I am not sure ....\nWell, why do not you ask False Lucy AI?

ID=601365201
Customer is Camisamades. How are you?

ID=601365202
(Ask Jessie if there is financial related data of Ruin Fortress)

ID=601365203
Finance related data deska.

ID=601365204
Well, Matarezdez.

ID=601365205
......

ID=601365206
......

ID=601365207
Finance related data does not exist in the database.

ID=601365208
However, there is relevant information and trout.

ID=601365209
Finance related data can be accessed by AI and ID of general employee.\nAccess only with access cards of certain higher grade admin.

ID=601365210
Another point, just before closing Ruin Fortress\nThe high-ranking admin remembers the cards again and the history remains.

ID=601365211
If it has not been discovered, Shitara, still within Ruin Fortress\nThere is a possibility that the lost cards are left and mass.

ID=601365212
Masuka searched directly?

ID=601365213
(I heard all the information gained from Jesse, return to Odon)

ID=560136501
How was it?\nHave you got any information?

ID=460136501
(Told Odon about the access card lost by high-level officials)

ID=460136502
Access card ....\nAccess card? Did you mean ....

ID=460136503
%username%.\nMay I wait for a while?\nThere is something I have to check in a hurry ....

ID=260137001
%username%. I found.

ID=260137002
Previously, when I was watching camera records,\nI felt like something like a card dropped in the aisle.\nWell, I thought it was looking for%username%.

ID=260137003
As soon as the staff confirmed it,\nIt remained in the record of the camera.

ID=260137004
Of course, that card may be different from what you are looking for.\nEven though I pretend not to see it ....

ID=260137005
Do you care what kind of card it is?

ID=260137006
Thank you%username%.\nPlease pick up that card.

ID=660137001
Thank you very much.\nWhen confirmed with the camera, it fell into the passage area heading for the underground power room.

ID=660137002
Since it was a previous record, what is going on now ....

ID=360137001
Probably it will be in a difficult place to find.\nIt is a small card and please try looking for it while breaking obstacles.

ID=560137001
Did you have access cards?

ID=560137002
(Pass the access card to Odon)

ID=460137001
Thank you for your hard work.\nLet's check this card.

ID=260137501
Would you mind waiting a minute?

ID=260137502
......

ID=260137503
After all, as I thought ....

ID=260137504
This access card ... It is a thing of the stake of the high grade and there is no mistake.

ID=260137505
As a result of accessing the Ruin Fortress database from my terminal,\nI put it in the folder containing various documents, including financial records.\nThere were people's name records to confidential information.

ID=260137506
but ....

ID=260137507
... Most of the financial records related have already been deleted.\nWell of course it is.\nI will not imitate to leave behind poor marks ....

ID=260137508
However, it seems that he was in a hurry.

ID=260137509
When examining further in detail,\nApparently, it does not seem to have physically destroyed the data.

ID=260137510
Deletion logs remain on the database.\nWhether it was really in a hurry or not is unknown ....

ID=260137511
Thanks to you I got a clue.

ID=260137512
May I ask you a little more,%username%?

ID=660137501
Do you know the "illusion program"?

ID=660137502
It is a program created by a group of hackers eight years ago.\nFor a while, I made the public a stir.

ID=660137503
The illusion program is based on the records remaining in the computer\nIt is a common sense break program that rebuilds a virtual program.

ID=660137504
From the financial data, I was able to confirm the record that the illusion program was purchased.

ID=660137505
Probably in preparation for emergency in the underground power room,\nYou seem to have purchased a recovery program.

ID=660137506
Will you bring this program?\nWith an illusion program,\nYou should be able to recover the financial record at once.

ID=360137501
I do not know where it is.\nHowever, it should be somewhere in the underground power room.

ID=360137502
Or ... Someone has ....

ID=560137501
Oh, can you wait a minute?\nI am checking other data now.

ID=560137502
Hmm ... Here again the name of the payee is a pseudonym ....

ID=560137503
Oh, I'm sorry. I have kept it waiting long.\nDid you find the illusion program?

ID=560137504
(Pass the tip containing the illusion program to Odon)

ID=560137505
Thank you very much.\nThen, we will immediately restore financial data.

ID=560137506
(Odon connected the chip to the computer)

ID=560137507
... It's been a long time since these days. Do not you think so?

ID=560137508
By the way, when talking to%username% until now\nThere were a lot of things about work. my mother.

ID=560137509
Because I am not good at talking about myself from the beginning.

ID=560137510
... Maybe you are aware of it,\nActually, I am not an "ordinary employee" of the Alliance Bank.

ID=560137511
... It is the third son of the Claude Dream Union Bank Governor.

ID=560137512
......

ID=560137513
Her response is thinner than I thought.\nIt is something like an ordinary person to pull back.

ID=560137514
Believe you believe I will leave it to%username%.

ID=560137515
But ... to tell someone about yourself,\nI have never been there before.

ID=560137516
To be honest, I am still surprised at myself.

ID=560137517
From Loco Town to Ruin Fortress.\nThinking about it, because you were,\nI think I was able to come so far as I avoided the surroundings.

ID=560137518
You will not yield to numerous miseries and severe reality,\nI keep going forward.\nApart from whether it is correct or not ....

ID=560137519
I think I will go forward as well.

ID=560137520
The time has come to settle the facts we have avoided so far.

ID=560137521
(As soon as Odon finished talking, the restoration alert sounded)

ID=560137522
The restoration seems to be completed.\nLet's check it.

ID=460137501
(Odon began reading the data at a great speed)

ID=460137502
Hmm, a huge amount is still flowing from the coalition bank.

ID=460137503
Among the funds that flowed to Ruin Fortress,\nApproximately 30% of people are unknownly brought in from the Allied Bank.

ID=460137504
People involved in it ... that is ....

ID=460137505
......

ID=460137506
... Excuse me.\nI do not think I can not teach any more.

ID=460137507
Thank you for lending me your strength.\nHowever, from this point I would like to proceed with the survey alone.

ID=460137508
When the time comes, I will tell you everything ....\nSo you'll excuse me.

ID=260138001
Hey, what shall I do ....

ID=260138002
Fuu ....

ID=260138003
......

ID=260138004
%username%! Why are you watching it silently!\nEven though there are those who are suffering from suffering and despair in front of us.\nYou do not have a conscience! What?

ID=260138005
(I can not help it, so I ask Betty what happened)

ID=260138006
Actually, it's a little troublesome.

ID=260138007
Thanks to the communication network prepared by the Alliance,\nAlthough it is possible to contact with outside even while the strategy is in progress,\nOther crew members will not be able to communicate themselves when going to an underground power room.

ID=260138008
I think that it is probably due to the electromagnetic waves coming from a huge power generator in the underground power station,\nMembers who carried electromagnetic shielding equipment also lost contact.

ID=260138009
Perhaps I think there is another problem ... will you see me?

ID=660138001
First of all, you should ask Ian.\nHe should know him well!

ID=360138001
But why did the equipment become useless ...?\nIs it also a high-performance EMP?

ID=601380101
Your Recently do not meet so often!\nAlso, did you ask Betty for something?

ID=601380102
... What a strange star. So? What are you talking about?

ID=601380103
(Ian tells Betty)

ID=601380104
Hmm ... can not you communicate even if you bring electromagnetic wave interrupter?\nThere is a problem with the Union's equipment supply.\nThe equipment itself may be defective ....

ID=601380105
Perhaps, perhaps you think it is due to "Ghost Zero"?

ID=601380106
I guess I fought, but it's like an octopus with tentacles.

ID=601380107
It was made with a department separate from my friend 's Mac.\nIn preparation for the electronic warfare, it was made with full of state-of-the-art technology.

ID=601380108
As expected there will be no effect on the soul workers ....\nFor machines equipped with electronic equipment such as tanks and helicopters,\nZero ghost is a natural enemy opponent.

ID=601380109
As a matter of fact, it has a range of 150 M in all directions\nPersistent electronic equipment disablement system (DurableElectronicNeutralizeSystem),\nI have electronic warfare equipment, aka "Dance".

ID=601380110
Instantaneous electronic equipment destruction like EMP, not destructive,\nElectronic equipment that has entered the range of dense\nIt is a terrible weapon that makes it impossible to activate until dance stops.

ID=601380111
Even more amazing is ....\nThis divides an enemy and an ally.

ID=601380112
In other words, the robot recognized as zero ghost or friend\nYou can act without receiving electronic restrictions.

ID=601380113
As far as we are supposed to be a ghost zero\nThere is no way to be recognized.

ID=601380114
Well, you only have to destroy with force.

ID=560138001
Oh,%username%!

ID=560138002
How was it? What is Ian?

ID=560138003
(Tell Betty that you destroy Ghost Zero based on Ian's information)

ID=460138001
Is it true? It is strange.

ID=460138002
I just got in a while ago ....\nI have not heard from you yet.

ID=260138501
Hey,%username%.\nApparently, it seems not to just destroy Ghost Zero.

ID=260138502
Oh, of course I do not think I'm lying.

ID=260138503
However, since nothing can be solved at the present time,\nI am glad if you lend me some more.

ID=660138501
Once again, I have to talk to Ian ....\nHe is familiar with this kind of thing.

ID=660138502
Well, let's go to Ian!

ID=360138501
Why is Ian so familiar with robots and weapons so much?\nHe should have worked in a construction system ....\nIs that the influence of that friend?

ID=601385101
Ooo, Ian!

ID=601385102
What? ! Why are you here! What?

ID=601385103
Why, of course it is decided because there is a use!

ID=601385104
Do not come! Stay away!\nI will not use it for you!

ID=601385105
Hi Hi, Stop!\nIf it moves even a bit, it will spread to the Union network?\nIan to succeeding women ... ....

ID=601385106
Oh, that was fucked! ... Ku, is it a useless postcard?\nHuh ... So what is it for?

ID=601385107
Huhuu ♪ It became obedient.\nI heard about the underground power room, do not you?

ID=601385108
I heard it to some extent from%username% ....\nHave not you settled yet?

ID=601385109
It is not caused by zero ghost ....\nThen ... wait a moment.

ID=601385110
(Ian is looking for something while turning the notebook)

ID=601385111
O, is this caused?

ID=601385112
What what?

ID=601385113
To the ghost zero, you need electronic equipment called dance\nYou told me weapons to disable us?

ID=601385114
Yup.\nBut I destroyed everything, but nothing changed.

ID=601385115
That's it. But the problem lies elsewhere.\n"Heavy Dominia X" ... This is the cause!

ID=601385116
Heavy Dominia X has "zero dance" of zero ghost\nFurther improved equipment is installed.\nThe influence range is 5 km radius ...?

ID=601385117
Ok, 5 km ...? It does not cover Ruin Fortress.\n... It was saved because he was in the basement.

ID=601385118
That's right. If that got out,\nAs long as it is not a special counter-electronic warfare equipment, nothing can be used.

ID=601385119
I see ....\nSo even if you destroy Ghost Zero, you could not communicate.

ID=601385120
all right! Thanks, Ian!\nThis time was super saved!

ID=601385121
Please do remove my gossip quickly!\nNo, rather! Please!

ID=601385122
Oh no, no one promised?\nWell, but this time it was really saved.\nI will keep it for a while. Is this OK?

ID=601385123
Oh, thankfully ... wait.\nWell that's someday you will scatter! What?

ID=601385124
Huh, will I be like that?\n%username% destroy heavy dominia x!\nBai Bai ♪

ID=601385125
... That is the worst.

ID=601385126
Oh yeah, remember the device Ian said?\nIt's about a radio interference device called dense.\nWill you bring it with me? I wanted to investigate a bit.

ID=560138501
I love you! Finally I got in touch with the members who went to the underground power room ~.\nFortunately I could not find it on a robot.\nI am coming back now.

ID=560138502
Hehe\nIan's information, this time it seems to be true.

ID=560138503
Members were also alright, and I was able to communicate ....\nThat's it! What is a radio interference device?

ID=460138501
(Pass the radio interference device to Betty)

ID=460138502
Thank you,%username%.\nI will send this device to the laboratory immediately to investigate!\nIf there is anything else please ask. Thanks ~.

ID=260139001
Oh,%username%. Welcome.\nA little, is your time okay?

ID=260139002
... Finally, I caught a tail of a stroke.

ID=260139003
Yesterday evening, I went to the warehouse to see how Poti was.

ID=260139004
Oh, Pochi is the name of the animal robot you brought before.

ID=260139005
Anyway ... When I went to see, something was huge with huge Pochi.

ID=260139006
It seemed like a fierce battle, so I could not bring it closer,\nIt was a huge monster hanging something like a tentacle.\n... To be honest, I was terrified and could not move.

ID=260139007
Thanks to the union who came across the battle,\nThe monster ran away.\nHave a bag with an oil box this time as well ....

ID=260139008
However, this time I set a trap.\nI put a GPS tracking device in it.

ID=260139009
This time I chased it.\nPlease get back my bag,%username%!

ID=660139001
Thank you very much.\nThe place confirmed by GPS is called the underground power room.

ID=660139002
Please let me know that the monster never steals again!

ID=360139001
Did you forget the place?\nIt is a power room in the basement.\nPlease manage somehow before the monster disappears.

ID=560139001
Welcome back,%username%.\nDid you find a monster?

ID=560139002
(Passing bags to Yomi and talking about monsters)

ID=560139003
Grasper ...?\nWas it Ned Company 's robot?

ID=560139004
To this place the robot steals oil ....\nIt is a very aggressive robot ....

ID=560139005
But what did you use oil for?\nIt should not be something that can be used as fuel, though ....

ID=560139006
No way, that tentacle does not rust.

ID=560139007
Okay ... can not that be?

ID=460139001
Fuu ... I'm sorry I just made an unreasonable request.

ID=460139002
Thank you also for Pochi ... Thank you.\nI have been taking time off since I came here,\nThanks to Pochi I am healed a lot.

ID=460139003
... Without Pochi,\nPerhaps he was saying sorely while leaning against the wall this time.

ID=460139004
Anyway, thank you.\nI'm going to repair Pochi.\nBecause I got hurt in the fight with the struggle ....

ID=260139501
Oh,%username%.

ID=260139502
I feel like I've gone a long time since I came to Ruin Fortress.

ID=260139503
I got used to inorganic mechanical sounds and cold winds.\nI can not sleep the other way if I can not hear it.

ID=260139504
There are many robots that I have never seen before,\nIt makes me feel like being in a movie or a distant future.

ID=260139505
If Katherine could come with me ....

ID=260139506
When I was in Kandathi City,\nCatherine repeatedly said that I want "Burning Red MK II" ....

ID=260139507
It was dangerous to carry to Kandas city at that time, so I refused.\nBut I asked many times, suddenly brought Aaron 's watch secretly ....

ID=260139508
Really the girl ....\nI finally asked them to lose their roots and get them sent to a merchant association.

ID=260139509
... After all, I could not hand it over.

ID=260139510
......

ID=260139511
Gusu ... that ... ... tears ....

ID=260139512
Sorry for a moment.

ID=260139513
......

ID=260139514
(Yomi wipe away tears and breathe in)

ID=260139515
... Excuse me.\nEven though%username% who was there was supposed to be hotter than I am ....

ID=260139516
Can I ask you a single%username%?

ID=260139517
I was considering it from a few days ago, but when I return to Kandas city later,\nI thought I would give Aaron Mr. Burning Red MK II.

ID=260139518
So I confirmed the inventory to the merchant association,\nIt was a long time ago that the factory was closed and it was out of print.

ID=260139519
Although I got a production design drawing and photos sent,\nMy hands are clumsy so I can not do anything.

ID=260139520
Ah ... if it's okay I want Burning Red MK II in my jute\nCould you tell me to make it?

ID=660139501
(Ask why you do not say it directly)

ID=660139502
Ah, that is ....\nActually, I did a fight a few days ago.\nBecause I got over it a bit at that time ....

ID=660139503
After a while I was calm down quite a bit,\nI feel like somehow it is avoided by the JIT ....

ID=660139504
Anyway, it is not good to go out wrongly from me.\nAnd anyway! I ask you instead of me. %username%.

ID=360139501
Ah! What I said was absolutely secret!\nIf you talk to the Jite, I will double the price of the item!

ID=601395101
Welcome, ha ha ha!\nWhat kind of message do you have for today?\nOh, was it a periodic check of Seoul Weapon?

ID=601395102
(Show the design drawing and picture of Burning Red MK II to Jite and try to make it)

ID=601395103
Here, this is a burning red MKⅡ design drawing!\nSince Burning Red became out of print,\nIt's a prestigious spouse that is said to be hard to obtain!

ID=601395104
I do not know how I got it,\nCan I really do it?

ID=601395105
It's a terrific opportunity, though ....\nCan you give me a moment to think about it?

ID=560139501
......

ID=560139502
I am, I decided.

ID=560139503
To meet the expectation of%username%,\nI have never seen it before ... No, I will never come back later,\nBurning Red MK II: JUIT CUSTOMS!

ID=460139501
I'm going to make some modifications to this design drawing ....\nCan you wait for a while? I'll fix it soon!

ID=260140001
I was waiting!

ID=260140002
Tentatively, the design drawing was completed to a certain extent.\nHowever, I need some time to fix it ....

ID=260140003
Nonetheless, just waiting for you is boring.\nCan not you ask a little about asking?\nOh, of course it is a matter of Burning Red MK II.

ID=660140001
Basic materials are not enough to make this one.

ID=660140002
Anyway, the characteristics of the Burning Red series are burning reds!

ID=660140003
The materials of the skeleton are aligned,\nIt takes a lot of time to express that red.

ID=660140004
Actually, it seems that the red armored robot is in Ruin Fortress.\nIf you can use it, you should be able to do three times as fast as you can from now.

ID=660140005
I want you to get the armor of that robot!\nIn the meantime I will finish the design drawing!

ID=360140001
Please do not hurt as much as possible!\nIf the painted part gets scratched, it will be useless!

ID=560140001
Were you able to obtain it?

ID=560140002
(Pass the red iron plate to the jute)

ID=460140001
Oh! This is a better color than I thought.\nAnd gloss of this surface ... Well.\nThere's no need to take any special action!

ID=460140002
Thank you!\nIt seems to be enough to use this.

ID=460140003
Ah! Design drawing ... Please wait a bit more!\nHa ha ha!

ID=260140501
Haha ... Um, I'm sorry.\nI thought about various things while drawing a design drawing ....

ID=260140502
I started wanting to decorate and be armed with decorations.

ID=260140503
Anyway, please wait a little more!\nThe correction of the design drawing was almost done, so just a little more!

ID=260140504
Oh, before that ....

ID=260140505
There is a thing that is still missing a bit.

ID=260140506
Recently, there are many requests for weapons repair from the coalition!\nStrange to us, everyone loses weapons screws.\nHa ha ha!

ID=260140507
... Excuse me.\nAnyway, that's why there are not enough screws at hand.

ID=260140508
Will you collect small screws?\nParts used also for Burning Red MKⅡ!

ID=660140501
A small robot screw called "Trekker" is good.

ID=660140502
It seems that they are often roaming inside Ruin Fortress,\nIt is not hard to get it.\nHa ha ha!

ID=360140501
Oh, there is something I care about a bit ....

ID=360140502
Mr.%username%, is it boring as my joke is boring?\nYomi's fellow, when I say a joke,\nThe face will solidify like a bronze statue. Haha!

ID=360140503
......

ID=360140504
Excuse me.

ID=560140501
(Pass the screws to the jite)

ID=560140502
It was quick! Thank you!

ID=560140503
Oh, and I asked for a variety of things with it,\nA little, please.

ID=460140501
And, although it is a design drawing, it will take a little more time.

ID=460140502
When%username% went looking for screws, it started flashing.

ID=460140503
Is it a good idea to have me wait for a while?\nReally little more!

ID=260141001
Well, finally the design drawing has been completed!

ID=260141002
There are materials that are still missing, so you can not make it right away!

ID=260141003
But, I can see it ...!\nWhen this guy is finished ... brilliant brilliancy filled with elegance!

ID=260141004
......

ID=260141005
Although it may be over,\nEven with the materials as shown in the design drawing,\nIt is a model you can show unexpected quality!

ID=260141006
And ... There is one trust at the end.

ID=260141007
Robot is armed but life!\nUntil now I was concentrating on the main body, so the thing of arming was postponed.

ID=260141008
Speaking of Burning Red's sword, "ignition sword" suck!

ID=260141009
I see it when I see the original.\nIgnition sword is a thin sword.\nWell, you may not say it is a sword to watch.

ID=260141010
But when the blade of the beam comes out of that sword,\nAn incredibly brilliant cut.

ID=260141011
(Jight told hot about the ignition sword for a while)

ID=260141012
So, the beam of the ignition sword was made with clear parts,\nI intend to make the main body with steel.

ID=260141013
So,%username%.\nI want you to get a thin and sharp steel that will become the material of the ignition sword!

ID=660141001
I sneaked through the union's material and found that there was a nice guy.\nAnimal robotus "Hearty".

ID=660141002
The blade attached to that robot!\nIt was exactly for ignition sword!

ID=660141003
So, if you have it ...!\nIt is almost possible to reproduce the ignition sword almost perfectly!

ID=660141004
Please!\nPlease let Burning Red have weapons!

ID=360141001
After that, if that Hearty has only his blade ...!\nPlease come and get it!

ID=560141001
(Pass Hearty's blade to Jite)

ID=460141001
how was it?

ID=460141002
Ohh ...! This is the perfect fit for ignition sword!\nAll right! I will just finish it later. Congratulations!

ID=260141501
OK, it's finally over!

ID=260141502
This is where all the parts were completed.\nAfterwards assembling this, the completion of Burning Red MK II.

ID=260141503
(I immediately ask you to assemble it)

ID=260141504
I am thinking a bit ....\nI feel like I will lose meaning if I build this up.

ID=260141505
I was pretending not to know but this was asked by Yomi, is not it?

ID=260141506
To tell the truth, I also came here and saw the robot made by Ned Company,\nI thought about Katherine.

ID=260141507
When I was in Kandathi City, I asked him many times.\nMake burning red MK II ....

ID=260141508
At that time, I did not quite understand what Catherine was saying,\nI knew that it's a robot that will appear later in anime.

ID=260141509
I was too busy at that time, I could not stop it.\nI wanted to make Katherine alive.

ID=260141510
I'm listening to the story.\nUntil the last moment with Katherine ... You've been together forever, are not you ...?

ID=260141511
So, it is better for%username% to complete this than%\nI thought Katherine would surely be pleased ....

ID=660141501
Oh, what if I had some insecurity when someone helped me?\nI'd like to help you, but it seems to be difficult this time.\nThere are other things to do for me ....

ID=360141501
By the way, is Mr. Aaron cheerful?\nI do not know the details, but I heard that the impression has changed a lot.

ID=601415101
What happened? Is it a request?

ID=601415102
(Give the design drawing and materials of Burning Red MK II to Zenith and ask him to lend me his power)

ID=601415103
Hmm, is this a Plamo?

ID=601415104
It's my first time to ask for such a request ... well, OK.\nIt looks interesting. Well, at a special price ....

ID=601415105
Huh? You want me to help you directly because I want to make it directly?\n... Soul worker, I am not a volunteer.

ID=601415106
... I do not see anything wrong. understood. I will help you.\nHonestly, I have to cut out parts individually.\nWith this nipper ....

ID=601415107
......

ID=601415108
(Burning Red MK II has been completed! It is feelingless!

ID=601415109
Yeah ... It is a good idea to make it for the first time?\nOkay, then to this ....

ID=601415110
(Zenith concentrates on work with Burning Red MK II)

ID=601415111
I made black ink and decal specially.\nYou see painful eyes when a beginner does it.\nCome on, I went if I finished my work. Take your money when you're late for it?

ID=560141501
Mr.%username%, the matter of Burning Red I asked ....\nWhat has become of it? It seems that it will take some time yet?

ID=560141502
(To Yomi, finished Burning Red MK II: Pass Jight Custom)

ID=460141501
Th-This is ...!

ID=460141502
That's amazing.\nReally Jight does this ...?

ID=460141503
I do not really understand the plastic model,\nAs far as I see with the eyes of a merchant ... It is likely to sell to collectors at an extremely high price.

ID=460141504
It is something I asked for ....\nHow much will it cost you? Haha.

ID=460141505
Huh, it is a joke.\nThis is thanks to Jite and%username%.\nI will take responsibility and surely deliver it to Mr. Aaron.

ID=460141506
......

ID=460141507
Wait a minute! Why are you looking at such eyes?\nplease do not worry. I will never sell it!

ID=260142001
Hello,%username%.\nIt was just right. There is something I want to ask. Haha.

ID=260142002
The request this time is so hard ....\nNo ... It may be harder than the previous request depending on what you think.

ID=260142003
The content of the request is simple.

ID=260142004
I lent a little money to Mr. Jite before I came here.\nIt is almost time for repayment,\nI will never meet even if I visit many times.

ID=260142005
Are they avoiding me ...?\nI do not know if the timing is only bad,\nI have another job as well ....

ID=260142006
So, can you tell Mr. Jite instead?\nIt's about time to repay ... and.

ID=660142001
Thank you,%username%.

ID=360142001
Is it possible to avoid returning money?\nOr is it just a bad timing?

ID=601420101
Oh,%username%!\nDid not you see Ordon?

ID=601420102
(Telling you that you have not seen it)

ID=601420103
Was good!

ID=601420104
(Tell Oudon 's word as it is to the jute of peace)

ID=601420105
Poor! Was it something I did not forget?\nOh, no, it's not. %username%.\nWake was trying to step over money separately ...!

ID=601420106
That ... I do not know!\nThat I'm studying Ned Company 's robot at Grace City! !

ID=601420107
I needed money for robot research.\nI always borrowed it from Yomi but this time it's difficult.

ID=601420108
So, I owe it to Odon.\nIt was not official borrowing ....

ID=601420109
(I ask if I will delay the repayment date)

ID=601420110
Well, that guy is a bit difficult.

ID=601420111
Just a rumor, though.\nThose who went to Odon to ask for postponement of the repayment date,\nEveryone gonna get out of their way ....

ID=601420112
......

ID=601420113
Well, maybe not? Ha, ha ha ...!\nDoes that one day suddenly disappear ...? Hey ...?

ID=560142001
However, it is also difficult to delay the repayment date in the unlikely event.\nI, what should I do?

ID=460142001
Huh\nYou will be thrown away as it is ....

ID=460142002
%username%.

ID=460142003
Help me for a moment ...!\nOh, no ... I will contact you again later.

ID=260142501
Ms.%username% ... Please help me!\nNo matter how you think, it will not be possible to solve by one person ....\nNo, I can not solve it!

ID=260142502
Well, I will not abandon me like this! Is not it? Is not it?

(Accepting while sighing)

ID=260142504
Thank you! Ha ha ha!\nAfter all, I have only%username% in my!

ID=260142505
Anyway, I also got all the money I got ... but ...\nIt was only about 10% of the borrowed money.

ID=260142506
I'm paying for selling things but something.\nI do not go very well.

ID=260142507
Um ... is it good if you do not help me sell it?

ID=660142501
(Jight took out the familiar thing from where he was)

ID=660142502
Oh, huh ....\nBeltus I made before. With Kandusity ... ha ha.\nDo you remember?

ID=660142503
I thought I would throw it away ....\nI made it with the material that%username% gathered ....

ID=660142504
I will always carry it all the time.\nWell, I thought never to see the eyes again.

ID=660142505
Thank you!\nPlease sell this one! !

ID=360142501
It will be serious if you borrow with a light feeling!\nWhen I found it, I understood ....

ID=601425101
What happened? Are you taking time out?\nBring me something warm, if I am free like that.\nIt is cold and is about to die.

ID=601425102
... So what is it for?

ID=601425103
(I hesitated for a while, take out the item made by Jite)

ID=601425104
... this is?

ID=601425105
... Would you like to add this? No, you say you can buy this?

ID=601425106
To proudly present such a dark attribute substitute ....\nMoreover, the perfection degree is low.\nBring more decent things if you sell it.

ID=601425107
But, if sales are a goal, how about appealing more?\nThat's right, turn on it directly! You look nice! Ha ha ha!

ID=601425108
(... leave before being insulted further)

ID=601425201
Oh, are you a long time? How have you been?

ID=601425202
(Ian shows the items made by Jite)

ID=601425203
... What?

ID=601425204
What's want you to buy me? Let's see ....

ID=601425205
It is a joke! What? please stop!\nWell, where did you get these things?\nNo handmade ... Ah, Hey!

ID=601425206
(Leave before being further pursued by Ian)

ID=601425207
Let me know who made it!

ID=601425301
Wow! ! ! I was surprised ... do not appear suddenly.\nSo ... what do you want for me? Or ... what you want to buy?

ID=601425302
(When I showed the belt to Senson, Jight suddenly came in)

ID=601425303
I waited for a moment! ! !\nHello! Mr. Senseon! Ha ha ha!

ID=601425304
... Thanks.\nYou sure ... Jight ... was it?

ID=601425305
That street! A weapons merchant's jitet!\nTo Senseon, I will tell you directly from me!\nHa ha ha!

ID=601425306
Huh ... so what is this hentote object?\nI do not really understand the application, though.

ID=601425307
I thought about explaining it!

ID=601425308
From the underground waterway where Seoul Junk wandered at Kandas City,\nDo you know the story of legendary mercenaries who survived alone? What?

ID=601425309
... and I do not know.

ID=601425310
This belt! Yes, this is exactly ...!\nI kicked a lot of Seoul junk and survived from the dead ground\nThe "belt of courage" what a legendary mercenary was using!

ID=601425311
Of courage ... belt?

ID=601425312
That's right!\nWith him, calmly in any battlefield,\nAnd you can fight bravely!

ID=601425313
This is indispensable for a soldier! No, essential for men!\nDisagreeable! In addition, it is God eye which can be said to be essential for human beings ....

ID=601425314
... Well, it looks like a lie.

ID=601425315
Well, not a lie!\nIf you have this, you can become the best man!

ID=601425316
Powerful person ...?\nWell, can you become a "real strength person" ...?

ID=601425317
That's right! !\nYou should be able to get the power of the image!\n(Although I do not know what "real genders" point to what ...)

ID=601425318
... OK! bought!

ID=601425319
Hu, really purchasing! What?

ID=601425320
Oh!

ID=601425321
(Senseon paid money to the jite and received the goods)

ID=601425322
... This is ... How can I get it?

ID=601425323
Ah ... um, s something ....

ID=601425324
(I attached the belt inside clothes so that Senseon can not be seen from the outside)

ID=601425325
Well ... It's quite nice!\nYou can wear it so easily!

ID=601425326
Oh ... somehow hot one seems to spring up from the inside! Is this "power" that Jight was saying!

ID=601425327
Huh? Oh, yes!\nThat 's right!

ID=601425328
Okay! Power came!\nI want to try this power quickly ...!\nWell, I will go! See you! !

ID=601425329
......

ID=601425330
... Something, I do not feel bad.

ID=601425331
Um,%username%.\nI'm sorry but Senseon ... are not you going to chase me?

ID=601425332
That tension ... I feel a bit dangerous. Ha, ha ha ....

ID=560142501
Huh ... Hey ....\nIt helped me ... Thank you.

ID=560142502
This "belt of courage\\nWhen you stand in front of the robot, your legs will tremble as usual,\nNothing of true ability came out at all ....

ID=560142503
There was just a broken robot, so I could hide in it and let it pass.\nIt would have been found if you did not come.\nThank you very much ....

ID=460142501
Oh, and also ... It's a guy I bought from Jite.

ID=460142502
Now it's a return! !

ID=260143001
... Excuse me.\nJust as gold looked blind.

ID=260143002
No, I did not expect it to take action so soon.

ID=260143003
But, it was good because%username% followed it.

ID=260143004
(I asked if I refunded to Senseon to Jite)

ID=260143005
Sure! There was such a thing ... Senseon came and refunded immediately.\nThanks to that, I decided to refund all the money to other people who sold the goods.

ID=260143006
......

ID=260143007
You also returned to the beginning.

ID=260143008
I can not sell anything to the people here already,\nI do not have time until the repayment date of gold borrowed from Odon ....

ID=260143009
There is only one method left.

ID=260143010
Borrow money from Yomi! ! !

ID=260143011
There is no other way ....\nEven though my debts are pile-up, I have ... only 10% of the principal remains!

ID=260143012
Thank you%username%.\nPlease persuade Yomi with me!

ID=260143013
Even if I go alone, I will absolutely be paid in advance.

ID=660143001
(I told you to cooperate with serious figure that Jait will show for the first time)

ID=660143002
Thank you! Thank you!

ID=660143003
I hope Yomi 's mood is not bad today. Well, let's go!

ID=360143001
Haa ... it's hard to be struggling with debt owing to debt ....

ID=601430101
Welcome ... Jite to%username% ...? What is wrong?

ID=601430102
Ha ha ha! I wonder if Yomi is doing fine!

ID=601430103
Hmm ... Stop losing yourself barely.\nThe jite can not come to me without any purpose, is it?\nBesides, brought you in the form of%username%.

ID=601430104
Well ... I expect almost anything ... but ....

ID=601430105
Ha ... Ha ha ....

ID=601430106
... That?

ID=601430107
Yo, Youmi-sama! !

ID=601430108
(Jayt will dogeit in front of Yomi)

ID=601430109
Look,%username% as soon as possible!

ID=601430110
(I was hurried for some reason, but ignored and stood as it was.\nThe Jaite sees this with eyes like asking, but threw it as it was.\nAfter a while Jaight lowered his head again)

ID=601430111
And suddenly? Jite! %username%!

ID=601430112
Yomi ... I have only you in my present.

ID=601430113
... Huh? There is only me ... what?\nwait. Well, that is ....

ID=601430114
Mr. Yomi! Please lend me some money!

ID=601430115
Wait a minute, Jight!\nEven if you are told such a thing suddenly, what is the preparation of your heart ...?

ID=601430116
There are only you for you to borrow money ... I beg you! Yomi!

ID=601430117
... No good. I definitely do not want to eat!\nAbsolutely ... I will not lend you absolutely! !

ID=601430118
Yomi! Somehow there! !\nI thought that I would help myself, just ask once! !

ID=601430119
Huh ... Jight as usual.\nCompletely ... what happened?

ID=601430120
(Jait tells you how the borrowed money from Odon to Yomi and that the repayment deadline is approaching)

ID=601430121
Ha ... well, I knew it since I was in Grace City.

ID=601430122
Ask ... I already have you only.

ID=601430123
... Do not use such words lightly!

ID=601430124
... Huh? Did I say weirdly now?

ID=601430125
Nothing, nothing! Already!\nHuh, it can not be helped. I will lend you money if you listen to my request. Everything is impossible ....

ID=601430126
Is it true? Thank you, yo!

ID=601430127
I am in good shape.\nWhat I would like to ask is the contents of the e-mail sent to all members from the merchant association a while ago.

ID=601430128
Email? Is such a coming?

ID=601430129
... Fuu.\nI thought I was not watching anything.\nI will explain.

ID=601430130
A short time ago, from the Merchant Association Materials Department, the steel to be delivered to Lion Corporation was short,\nI got an email saying that I want steel from all members of the association. With enormous prize money.

ID=601430131
what? Is it so?\nHow much is that prize money?

ID=601430132
Well, at least ....\nEven if you return all the money borrowed from Odon, is it enough?\nThat's why it's pretty solid.

ID=601430133
Is it true? What? %username%! Let's go quickly!

ID=601430134
wait!

ID=601430135
Where are you?

ID=601430136
Even if you get a prize,\nIt should be after repayment date to receive ... is it okay?

ID=601430137
Well, is that so ....

ID=601430138
So bring the goods to me.\nI will lend you the appropriate money instead.\nI understood?

ID=601430139
... There seems to be no other way. %username%.\nAs Yomi says, the steel that the merchant association is looking for is just to pass it to Yomi.

ID=601430140
Tentatively, the steel materials scattered around here ... can not be used.\nThe period that was neglected is also long and it is a used material so it is easy to deform.

ID=601430141
So I thought it was one thing,\nWhat is the drill on the arm of the robot called "Sprinter"?

ID=601430142
Since the drill itself must use high strength steel,\nEven if neglected, the state is better than other steel materials.

ID=601430143
Then, can you go get it now?\nThe more you lose, the lower the prize amount, so I think that it is better to hurry.

ID=601430144
......

ID=601430145
I want to go there, though.\nThe Star Forest Coalition will not put civilians in the operational area.

ID=601430146
So ...%username%! Please!

ID=560143001
Dear%, username%, did you get steel?

ID=560143002
(I showed a high-intensity drill to Yomi)

ID=460143001
Thank you very much. Things are better than I thought.\nIf this is the case, it seems that the merchant association will receive the prize properly.

ID=460143002
Oh, I have already lent money to Jite.\nBecause%username% surely will keep promises.

ID=460143003
Oh, I have forgotten to mention one to Jite, but can you tell me instead?

ID=460143004
I have lent money I handed this time, so I will definitely return it later.

ID=260144001
I'm sorry I was struggling with my friend%username%.

ID=260144002
Thanks to Yomi and%username%, I did not return all the debts!\nSomething a little more than half could be returned! Ha ha ha! !

ID=260144003
I was not aware of the amount of money to a lesser extent.\nI have to prepare the rest for some reason but ... Is not there any better way?

ID=260144004
There are some things I want to sell, but I do not have anyone to buy.\nMake a weapon ... Oh!

ID=260144005
%username%! Is it okay to ask only one more?

ID=660144001
Something you are uncomfortable with! I make weapons and sell ... I never thought of such a thing ....\nIt seems that due to debt, I forgot the pride as a weapon merchant!

ID=660144002
In this case my trust to me fell to the ground but it is as good as that.\nBut if you do your best, everyone's feelings may change again!

ID=660144003
So, what I would like to ask%username%\nI want you to get things that will become the main material of weapons!

ID=660144004
"Gatling gun" installed in an attack type robot.\nActually, I was selling a laser integrated device a while ago.

ID=660144005
... I think that I will make a new weapon with these two things.

ID=660144006
... It may be a very demanding request, but thank you! !\nIf you make even this, repayment to Odon, not to mention worrying about money for a while ....

ID=660144007
... What is the money borrowed from me?

ID=660144008
Ah ... ha ha. Of course, of course! Are you determined to return?

ID=660144009
And anyway I asked! %username%! !

ID=360144001
First of all, why do not you look at building facilities?\nThere seems to be a lot of robots using Gatling guns.

ID=560144001
Oh,%username%!\nI waited long for my neck! Ha ha ha!

ID=560144002
GATTORING GUN ... What happened? was it there?

ID=560144003
(Passing Gatling Gun to Jite)

ID=460144001
Thank you!

ID=460144002
It is quite different from what we deal with.\nThe magazine is also automated, and this is ... cooler?\nNed Company to this device until the Gatling gun ....

ID=460144003
... Oops, this is not the time to admire!\nThank you very much! I try to make a new weapon with this guy!

ID=260144501
(Jight started working on a new weapon, let's see a state for a while)

ID=260144502
......

ID=260144503
......

ID=260144504
Oh, sorry,%username% san.\nWhen concentrating, it will make the surroundings invisible ....

ID=260144505
I wonder what%username% is also making me, are not you?

ID=260144506
It's still under construction so you can not show it, but I'm thinking of making something like "beam gatling gun"!

ID=260144507
But ... It is OK that I started making it, but I feel like I will not finish making it in time ....

ID=260144508
......

ID=260144509
What shall I do?

ID=660144501
(I will tell you honestly talk to Odon and ask you to order the deadline)

ID=660144502
Fuu ... I guess I have no choice but to do so.

ID=660144503
Well then, will you come to Odon together?\nBefore I borrowed it once, I was awkward to talk alone.

ID=360144501
Let's go talking directly with Odon! !

ID=601445101
Oh? Mr. Jight? What kind of information do you have? Together with%username%.

ID=601445102
Hahaha ....\nEnergetic, Mr. Odon. Today I had something I wanted to talk about.

ID=601445103
Hmm, what are you talking about?\nNo way, you do not tell me you want me to delay the repayment date?

ID=601445104
Ah ... ha ha ha!

ID=601445105
... Yes.

ID=601445106
... I was disappointed with Mr. Jite.\nI believed in long relationships from Loco Town, who are sincere and firm.

ID=601445107
Moreover, even if I go to see you in the last few days I can never meet ... / /.

ID=601445108
......

ID=601445109
... I was just thinking of calling my men.

ID=601445110
Wow!

ID=601445111
Do not be so surprised. I was only thinking about it.\nWell, Fortunately Jight had come this way before I moved to action.

ID=601445112
That's right, right? Ha ha ha ....

ID=601445113
... So, because the money is not ready, are you telling me to postpone the deadline?\nOr ... ... for some other reason?

ID=601445114
To be honest ... I could not prepare money!\nIt is only half of the original one, including what I borrowed from Yomi, at hand now ... but ....

ID=601445115
but?

ID=601445116
I am making a Sugoi weapon that is more than the money borrowed by me now!\nHowever, there is a slight impossibility to make the development date in time for the repayment date ....\nSo I came and asked for something like this!

ID=601445117
... Hmm, can you tell me in detail what that Sugoi weapon is?

ID=601445118
(Jayt explained long about the weapons under construction for Odon)

ID=601445119
... I see.

ID=601445120
I understand.\nLet's delay the repayment date as desired.

ID=601445121
Is it true? What?

ID=601445122
Yes.

ID=601445123
Thank you very much. thank you very much!

ID=601445124
It is early to rejoice.\nInstead, there are some conditions.

ID=601445125
Is it conditional?

ID=601445126
Yes. The condition is that if the weapon under construction is completed, it will be transferred to me.\nThat is the condition for repayment date adjustment.\nOh, of course I decided to have my money repaid.

ID=601445127
Well, that is ....

ID=601445128
... Do not like the conditions? Then it can not be helped. Call my subordinates ....

ID=601445129
wrong! Something I do not like! Ha ha ha!\nWow, I understand! If that's the case, it's rather thankful!

ID=601445130
Huh ... I understand.\nLet's make a firm contract until this time. I will send the documents later.

ID=601445131
Yes, understanding. Ha ha ....\nWell then, I am with this ....

ID=560144501
... I suppose I'm going to take a breath for the time being ... It was okay with this ...?

ID=560144502
Anyway, the rest will be done by me alone.\nThank you very much for your kind help!

ID=460144501
Even so,\nI did not feel alive. Ha ha!

ID=460144502
It is the first time for me to be so hard, both mentally and physically!

ID=460144503
But I understood this time. There is nothing terrible than debt.

ID=460144504
I have to return Odon's debt quickly, and I should return it to Yomi!

ID=460144505
Mr. Jight?\nSorry for disturbing you.

ID=460144506
Inui! Mr. Odon! Ha ... ha ha.\nWhat 's wrong? Oh, did you bring a contract?

ID=460144507
No, I was somewhat accidentally forgotten to tell.

ID=460144508
Huh? Something ...?

ID=460144509
Although the principal is Chara, I forgot to tell him that I must return the interest. Haha.

ID=460144510
......

ID=460144511
Well, take care of yourself. Mr. Jight.\nLet's meet on the next repayment date.

ID=460144512
... Debt is endless ... hey ....

ID=260145001
%username%! I got new information! !

ID=260145002
I was looking around Mac while turning around,\nApparently there seems to be some robots that have been involved with!\nHowever, as time has passed a lot, where is it now ....

ID=260145003
... Damn, I do not want to depend on that girl,\nIt seems to only ask Betty. You will go with me, do not you?

ID=660145001
I do not want to see you as much as possible, but it can not be helped. let's go!

ID=360145001
Anyway, listen to me from Betty ... after that ... I'm begging you.

ID=601450101
Oh? Araha\nHey,%username%! Perhaps today the sun rose from the west?

ID=601450102
Is it strange?\nI can see someone who can not come to me ...?

ID=601450103
Who is going to come!\nI have decided to work!

ID=601450104
work? Wow? Why do not you think there are any people who are as busy as you are?\nOh, did you come to provide information? What kind of gossip? Whose? Ah ... about yourself?

ID=601450105
You are my black eyes, do not do gossip!\nI came here because I want some information.

ID=601450106
What? Why do not you have any merit and just give me information?\nIt is quite a good story of a bug.

ID=601450107
No, that ... well, I will pay you. Of course ....

ID=601450108
I wonder if I feel a little sick.\nWell depending on the content of the information? Is it a little expensive? Maybe I will?

ID=601450109
Kugu ... The information I want is the location of a robot.\nOne of the robots my friend was working when I was working here.\nThe name is "Dreadbuster".

ID=601450110
Wait, the friend you are talking about ... Macwoz?

ID=601450111
what? Do you know?

ID=601450112
of course! Do you think I will not investigate by watching two people acting together?\nYou wanted to know where the friend was going, did not you come here?

ID=601450113
... You knew everything. So, what about the information?\nWhat can I do for reward?\nUnfortunately I do not have any information that I can sell to you.

ID=601450114
Hehe, it can not be helped!\nI will also help with free time this time. Things that I do not want to do business with people's lives.

ID=601450115
... Is there life in the information that you have already been traded in here?

ID=601450116
Huh? What is it? Because I could not hear well, could you try again?

ID=601450117
No, no, nothing.

ID=601450118
Then it's going to be in the main theme.\nYou said the robot "Dreadbuster"\nYou should be inside the facility where the arcship was built.

ID=601450119
I can not identify the exact position. My power, then I do not know the situation inside the arc - ship.\nThere are far more robots than other areas of Ruin Fortress, are not they?

ID=601450120
... Because of that it is impossible to set up communication equipment, so it is impossible for regular members to enter.

ID=601450121
However, it is certainly only that the robot called Dreadbuster is inside the building.\nThis is right on my pen!\nIf not, I promise that I will never write gossip articles again.

ID=601450122
I see ...%username%. ask.\nGo there immediately and find a dreadbuster.

ID=601450123
And ... Betty.

ID=601450124
Hmm?

ID=601450125
... I wear it.

ID=601450126
Er ... What?\nWell, what did you say?

ID=601450127
......

ID=601450128
......

ID=601450129
... Did you eat something weird today?

ID=560145001
How was it? Did you find a dreadbuster?

ID=460145001
I can not find it! What?\nYou said that Betty is there ...!

ID=460145002
I'm sorry. Even though I confirmed the entrance, it seems that I was a little bit impatient.

ID=460145003
OK, let's look for other places too.

ID=260145501
Well, what will you do?

ID=260145502
Anyway you have to find out inside the arc ship?

ID=260145503
it can not be helped. Also to you ....

ID=260145504
Ian! I found it!

ID=260145505
Be Betty? You found out ... what?

ID=260145506
Dreadbuster! I knew where he is now!

ID=260145507
Are you sure? Where are you! What?

ID=260145508
I found it in Jessie's database!\nIt seems to be in the auxiliary equipment warehouse inside the arcship at the construction facility.

ID=260145509
Really! What? Thank you! ! %username%, hurry to get the Dreadbuster AI chip!

ID=660145501
It 's the power room area inside the arc - ship. Try to find it.

ID=360145501
Haha ... I never imagined Betty would cooperate so much.

ID=360145502
How exactly is the wind blowing?\nI thought that I would surely hate it ... before that was actually it.

ID=560145501
Oh,%username%! You returned!\nActually I also grabbed new information, but first let's check it from the AI ​​chip.

ID=560145502
(I passed a special production AI chip to Ian)

ID=460145501
Thank you. I will check it now!

ID=460145502
......

ID=460145503
The analysis content is written here.

ID=460145504
Hmm ... Looking at the content, it seems that it is not entirely over.

ID=460145505
"January 2"\n"Fortunately ... I am still alive, what I am surviving against her, it is a miracle in itself."

ID=460145506
"I feel that Zion is approaching us who fled to the arcship"\n"I knew that our future will not change where we endured a bit ... But,

ID=460145507
"As the last moment approaches, regrets rise up."\n"But we do not give up and survive, because this prototype is for that reason."

ID=460145508
Sion ...?\nWhat is that?

ID=460145509
From the content, it seems that this is the state as it is because of that Zion ....

ID=460145510
... If so, the stuff of these contents should remain in the information I brought.

ID=260146001
First of all, the last robot in charge of Macwoz is the same type as the one who obtained the AI ​​chip ....

ID=260146002
... "Full Armor Sieg Proto".\nIf the prototype that matched the record is about the guy,\nThis would be no doubt what was produced for Zion.

ID=260146003
And ... Now I heard from other members that the robot is sleeping in the Ark Ship's command room.

ID=260146004
... but I do not understand!

ID=260146005
Why is such a heavily armed robot in Arc Ship 's command center? What has become of Zion ...?

ID=260146006
... Anyway, I'd like you to get AI chips right away.\nThen you may know all the stuff that happened here.

ID=660146001
It is the command room area inside the arc-ship.\nAlthough it was said that it was not moving with the staff's story, I do not know what state it is now. Be careful.

ID=360146001
... I have a bad feeling ....

ID=560146001
......

ID=560146002
(I handed a broken AI chip to Ian of uneasy expression)

ID=460146001
... It's almost broken.\nIn this case, it seems to be difficult to check the contents even after analyzing ....

ID=460146002
......

ID=460146003
"May 1 s Day"\n"□ □ finally formed her as □□□□□"

ID=460146004
... this is going to break the bones.

ID=460146005
"□ □ sealed □ □" □ "was put in □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □"

ID=460146006
"I can not go back to □. □ □ □ □ □ no more ___ I saw □ □ like this ..."

ID=460146007
"No, I can return ...? □ With this deep hand ... Can we be here □ □ ..."

ID=460146008
"□ □ □ □ □ □ □ more than □ □ □ □ □ □ may not □"\n"□ □, sorry. □ □ Yes □ Yes □ ..."

ID=460146009
Wait, wait ...! What is Full Armor Siegproth in Arc Ship's Command Room ...?\nIt means that the robot was in the command center ... after the incident was over! What?

ID=460146010
To guess ... Ruin Fortress was destroyed by Zion and then something sealed Zion ...,\nIs the remaining people ...? What happened to the remaining people! What? No way ... no ... That can not be! !

ID=460146011
......

ID=460146012
Well, that should be ...!

ID=460146013
There should be something else, different information ...!\nIt's ... Mac can not die in such a place! !

ID=260146501
Surely ... there must be different information!

ID=260146502
Is the arcship a ride?\nThen, confidential recording devices like black boxes should be left!

ID=660146501
Surely, to the command room ...!\nIf you go to the command room, you may have that device! Collect it!

ID=360146501
Shinmun ... How about you ....

ID=560146501
How was it! What? Was there a black box! What?

ID=560146502
(I handed over the black box that I collected)

ID=460146501
Sorry! I wear it!\nIs this a black box with audio in the command center? Please wait a moment and check it soon ....

ID=460146502
... Do not listen!

ID=460146503
Betty ...?

ID=460146504
If it is the information in that black box ... I already know it.

ID=460146505
what ...? what do you mean?

ID=460146506
... Mr. Odon helped me.\nWhat happened in the arcship's command room ... What was the Ned Company doing?

ID=460146507
... why did you keep on till then?

ID=460146508
... Do you think you can easily speak?\nIan. You can not listen to it.

ID=460146509
I do not want to have it! This will be confirmed directly by me!

ID=460146510
He is ... I can not die!

ID=460146511
... your friend, Macworld ....\nFull name "Maknis · Wozniak" ... was a fianceee ... is not it?

ID=460146512
......

ID=460146513
... That's it. You are right.\nSo, I should check it directly!

ID=460146514
... You still do not understand?\nI do not understand what you mean, what does it mean?

ID=460146515
......

ID=460146516
You said you are not stupid ....\nShe is no longer there!

ID=460146517
... I've been looking for since you've named the name Macwoz.\nMost of it was deleted in the database, but the traces left by her still remained.

ID=460146518
Well that's why you visited the dormitory.

ID=460146519
If she was alive, she should have some information on her.\nBut when you visit already ... the collection at that time was her picture too.

ID=460146520
......

ID=460146521
I know you because I've seen you in front of me.\nIf you know the content of that black box, you will go to them soon.\nTo the Ned Company ....

ID=460146522
... Then, what do you want me to do ...?\n... Do not you just sit still like this! What?

ID=460146523
... What happens when you go. We ... just an ordinary human being. There is no special thing.\nNow ... I just have to wait. Wait until the opportunity comes or until someone takes revenge instead.

ID=460146524
......

ID=460146525
(Ian looks with a strong eyes)

ID=460146526
... Please make it.

ID=460146527
... Make an opportunity for you to take revenge on us!

ID=460146528
To Atsu who do not think human life at all.\nOpportunities for mediocre we can take revenge ...!

ID=460146529
It may take years ... I will wait even if it takes decades.\nI will survive all the time until that time.

ID=460146530
Until that time they will avenge their enemies.\nUoo ... Woooooooooo! !

ID=260148001
Well ... I do not know how much I think.\nWhatever principle ....

ID=260148002
Did you say Near Soul Worker ... Noah?\nAnyway, I care about the weapon that child uses.

ID=260148003
Basically it is in the form of a spear, but it also becomes like an umbrella according to the situation.\nIt can be said that the change of the frame accompanying it is a very simple principle depending on viewpoint ....

ID=260148004
The problem is energy generated from that weapon.\nIt changes to a shape like a blade in the form of a lance and a shield when in the form of an umbrella.

ID=260148005
The technology to change the form depending on the use of energy\nIt's not too difficult.\n... The problem is its rate of change.

ID=260148006
I think I understand it because I fought, but was it awfully variable?\nTechnique that instantly changes from a spear to an umbrella. The reverse is also correct.

ID=260148007
I can not believe it.\nThat's why I'm really interested.

ID=260148008
... I wonder if I can get the black box of the weapon that the child uses?\nIf you know what principle it is working on,\nIt might be applicable to soul weapons and gears.

ID=260148009
Looking in the long run, you should not be a bad story.\nWell then, I asked.

ID=660148001
... Personally, it's a matter I'm curious about.

ID=360148001
Bring me a black box of weapons used by near-soul workers like Noah.

ID=560148001
Did you bring it?\nIt was earlier than I expected.

ID=560148002
Hmm ... there is no special change in the weapon frame after all.\nHow to use Energy is the point though ....

ID=560148003
......

ID=560148004
... That!

ID=560148005
... I do not understand at all.

ID=560148006
... The algorithm used is not difficult,\nConverting energy form at high speed ... It is very complicated.

ID=560148007
Well ... I do not know until I ask Se Cerulean.\nBecause she specializes in weapons.

ID=560148008
Whew ... ....\nI forgot that this is a treasure house of over technology.

ID=460148001
... I will definitely ask you later.\nI will not waste your hardships.

ID=260148501
Uu ... cold ...!\nIt will freeze and drink as it is ....

ID=260148502
I wonder if the shower was masuzing ...?\nNo, as a woman the shower is absolutely indispensable ....

ID=260148503
Wow!\nWell, from there, from there ...! What?

ID=260148504
Well, were you listening to the current one person?

ID=260148505
......

ID=260148506
... Fuu, you can not help it if you are asked.

ID=260148507
If this cold person is in front of you, what do you say?\nIt is normal to say "You can put on your coat if it's cold" is not it?

ID=260148508
But you know! I can not do such a thing by a woman's pride!\nThere is something called an appealing point that can not give up even though it is cold!

ID=260148509
From long time ago "Fashionable is guts!"\nThat's exactly right.\nNo matter how harsh the circumstances, I will definitely not lose!

ID=260148510
To wear a coat with this cold weather ....\nMy pride does not allow such a thing!\nBecause I am ... "Amanda with high pride"!

ID=260148511
At least at least 10 degrees Climate ....\nEr ... Huh! ! It is slightly lower than 24 degrees a moment now!

ID=260148512
......

ID=260148513
But, although it may be lower than 24 degrees or 40 degrees, that does not matter!\nWoman's pride is not to yield to such a thing!\nYes, absolutely ... Absolutely!

ID=260148514
... ... Bull.

ID=260148515
(Amanda is trembling violently)

ID=260148516
U ... Uh! Sure, it's cold ...!\nBut this is about ...!

ID=260148517
(Amanda's body is trembling more violently)

ID=260148518
Pu, pride ...!\nA woman ... Uoo! !

ID=260148519
(Amanda's body is causing super vibration)

ID=260148520
......

ID=260148521
Um ... coat ... ... will not you come ... Kana?

ID=660148501
Well, do not have a jacket from the beginning.\nThere was no stock with a sudden decree ... ....

ID=660148502
Oh, please.\nI think I will die ...!

ID=360148501
Make a coat ...!

ID=560148501
Well, you brought it.\nI will have my coat on me soon!

ID=560148502
(Amanda is gazing at the warm clothing in peace)

ID=560148503
......

ID=560148504
I'm sorry. After all I can not wear this dress.

ID=560148505
No matter how the world is rotten ....\nI will not lose!

ID=460148501
I will definitely overcome such a thing!\nI do not bend women's pride alone!

ID=460148502
So, this is no longer necessary!\nI feel like I am reborn at this moment!\nI am ... "Amanda who is a true pride!"

ID=460148503
It is not cold anymore!\nWith this cold ... I can not prevent my pride!

ID=460148504
Vacation! ! ! !

ID=460148505
......

ID=460148506
... or, impossible after all?\nCould you get it?

ID=460148507
(... throw it away somewhere)

ID=460148508
Wait a moment, please! Hey, wait!\nMe, look! Freezing ... It might be dead?

ID=260149001
I thought carefully.\nIke 's middle - aged standards ... ....

ID=260149002
Handsome face? A large amount of money? Refined manners?\nNo, not. It is not.

ID=260149003
The heart of IKEARU middle-aged is "adult's afford".\nBecause it is such a world, a posture that can afford is appreciated.

ID=260149004
Frankly speaking, there is nothing missing from me.\nHonest appearance, sublime thought, sense flying to wit ....

ID=260149005
Besides, I have a job for the rest of my life.\nIt is not a position to fight at the forefront, but also has a long life as an occupation.

ID=260149006
Yes ... it is a big negative for mankind to decay people like me like this.\nI have to aim for middle-aged people who are a little bit better.

ID=260149007
So I think I should take a margin.\nSpeaking of a marginal pronoun ... book! musics! And ... it's a movie! !

ID=260149008
In particular, it is no exaggeration to say that it covers almost all genres in books.\nIt can be said that the movie is close to that.

ID=260149009
In short, I am missing music. That's it.

ID=260149010
You seemed better to have a little room.\nCan you ask me one?

ID=260149011
There will be some guys wearing headphones for near soul workers.\nHeadphones are also a symbol of music.

ID=260149012
Probably, that near soul worker is the same generation as you.\nIn other words, generation with young sensibility ....

ID=260149013
Because you were trapped in the blank for 15 years,\nSensibilities may not match the present age.\nIn other words, the sense may be old.

ID=260149014
So, the recent child, Near Soul Worker\nI'd like you to bring in the music I'm listening to.

ID=660149001
You do not have to ask where you got it.

ID=660149002
Well, thank you.\nWhether I can be a perfect beauty middle age depends on you.

ID=360149001
I need music that resonates with the sensitivity of the young generation.\nTo become perfect beauty middle age ....

ID=560149001
Mum, that was a pain.\nSo ... is this the example music?

ID=560149002
It's a typical data chip.\nContents ... only sound files? I see ....

ID=460149001
Well, OK, soon ....

ID=460149002
(Martin inserts a tip into the speaker)

ID=460149003
(You hear the sound from the speaker)

ID=460149004
"Listen carefully! Who will win ... only courageous people!"

ID=460149005
Mu ...? Th-This is ...!

ID=460149006
"Shake! Let the light become light and shine the world!"

ID=460149007
Is it a drama CD of a certain masterpiece robot animation!\nIt was not music.

ID=460149008
Why such a drama CD ...?\nIt should be a work before they were born ....

ID=460149009
... Really.

ID=460149010
In other words, masterpieces are not influenced by the times.

ID=460149011
Fu ... I could not be a cool middle-aged man,\nA masterpiece handed down without being swayed by the times.\nIt seems that the impression of that time will come back.

ID=460149012
So, I will review the masterpiece again.

ID=460149013
Thank you for awakening the sleeping excitement ... Thank you.

ID=460149014
(... go home and go to bed)

ID=260030101
Yo! Soul worker!\nFinally arrived in Kandus city? Haha!

ID=260030102
I thought that I left earlier than I ....\nYou are slower than you thought?

ID=260030103
Why am I here?\nWell, I love freedom.

ID=260030104
Haha, it is a joke.\nIt seems that a hen on a lion television is looking for me.\nYou know, it's a living thing?

ID=260030105
It seems there are those who have been choked to stay in Locotown.\nWell, I did come to this town that is generous to illegal activities with such a wake.

ID=260030106
Oh, that's right.\nPerhaps, are you not interested in 'becoming stronger'?

ID=260030107
I have a hacker I met in this industry.\nI thought if I was in Kandusity, I had a bad idea.

ID=260030108
I thought about introducing us.

ID=260030109
Why do you know that you are here?\nWell, this city will keep an eye on illegal activities.\nIt is a tacit understanding.

ID=260030110
Oh yeah, there are things to borrow the power of illegal to survive.\nThis is the forefront of the threat of Seoul junk.\nIt's already a limit. It is different from Locotown.

ID=260030111
How about this story? Why do not you want to see him?

ID=660030101
After all the soul workers are weak against "strength".\nThe name of the hacker is "Trisha."\nIf you search for a tall woman with blond hair it will be found soon.

ID=660030102
Speaking of the introduction of Zenith, it will show you interesting things.\nWhy do not you go and go?

ID=360030114
Look for a tall girl with blond hair. The name is "Trisha."\nWhen I say my name, I will show you something interesting.

ID=600301101
Hmm? What is it? Is something useful for me?\nSomeone's use?

ID=600301102
You mean Zenith?\nOh, then is it a soul worker?

ID=600301103
Wow, I'm happy! I'm Trisha.\nI'm reinforcing the soul weapon with the guy who is hacking.\nHowever, it is a monkey who does not understand that such a child is a soul worker.

ID=600301104
Is not it a child? I understand.\nWell then, should I call%username%?

ID=600301105
%username% will protect this candy city, do not you?\nThen, I will show one interesting thing with the meaning of gratitude.

ID=600301106
Ask me to "strengthen".\nBecause I will show you interesting things.

ID=600301301
How are you? Have you succeeded in strengthening?\nIs not it strange? it's funny, is not it?

ID=600301302
How did it go? Haha.\nIt is not so much a trade secret.

ID=600301303
Most existing Soul Weapons\nDid you know that the Star Forest Union managed it directly?

ID=600301304
After all I did not know. Well, that's right.\nIt's a policy I decided to put limit on you,\nI can not speak.

ID=600301305
Simply put, so that soul workers do not abuse power\nThe coalition rocked Seoul Weapon.

ID=600301306
Locking on data and suppressing the output of Seoul Energy.\nThere are several stages in this limit,\nNaturally, if you release the upper limit, the output will increase.

ID=600301307
Of course it can be released in the Starry Forest Alliance,\nIt is confusing to the extent that the process and method are impossible.

ID=600301308
So why do anyone else get hacked requests and cancel the limit?\nShe was caught quickly and sent to the court.\nWell, I have nothing to do with that.

ID=600301309
Why is that? I have good skills.\nIf hacking you will not go out to the right! Ah ha ha!\nBesides, I do not think anyone can do it.

ID=600301310
I'm hacking with ether lights.

ID=600301311
I do not really understand the principle.\nWith ether lights,\nThe limit of Seoul Weapon will temporarily stop.

ID=600301312
In the meantime, if you hack quickly and release the limit lock,\nIn the Union the soul weapon before reinforcement is still registered,\nYou can strengthen your weapons.

ID=600301313
Of course, I am not perfect because I am not God.\nLocks are so tight as the upper limit is reached,\nThe probability of failing hacking also rises.

ID=600301314
If you fail to hack, the limit stage you canceled will fall.\nIn the worst case, weapons themselves may be broken.\nBut I'm in trouble even if I have a grudge against you. I chose what you've chosen.

ID=600301315
If there is a special item to prevent destruction, the worst situation can be avoided.\nSo, do not worry so much.

ID=600301316
Then, is this about the explanation OK?\nIf you want to be strong, strengthening is essential.\nIf you have materials and money, I will cooperate as much as I can.

ID=600301317
Oh yeah ... strengthening earlier is also illegal.\nIf it's okay then come any time.

ID=600301318
Well then, see you later. %username%.

ID=560030101
Did you go?

ID=560030102
Apparently, it seems to be okay.\nMy head seems to be bad, but my arm is certain. You ought to borrow your power if necessary.

ID=560030103
Huhu. By the way, a soul worker.\nYou also act illegally, do not you?

ID=560030104
Unlike the production that I do, strengthening remains a trace.\nTraces of committing the law ....

ID=560030105
Well, the soul workers also said we got on the same ship as ours. Is not it?\nFrom now on I wonder where I saw me, what's wrong with me?

ID=560030106
I will forgive you for telling me about Perry before, Perry.\nBut when you do the next ... you know?\nYou will be at the court together? Ha ha ha!

ID=560030107
Of course, there is no problem if you do not say anything.\nDo not be bent.

ID=460030101
Welcome to the illegal ship, soul worker.\nEnjoy it because it's no problem. It is not a story without contents.\nJust by being illegal, the ability is certain.

ID=460030102
I hope that it will be safe until the day we meet again. Huff.

ID=260102001
%username%!\nOnce I had my luggage cleaned up, I found an unusual thing!

ID=260102002
Look, this!

ID=260102003
(Eric showed us a pretty old wrench)

ID=260102004
Well, I completely forgot. I was surprised because it came out suddenly.

ID=260102005
Hmm? What is wrong with this old wrench?

ID=260102006
This is the thing my father gave me when I got the mechanic qualification.\nMy father was a mechanic.

ID=260102007
I always had it like an amulet. I was completely forgetting while I was busy.\nI can not find it by car luggage adjustment ... I'm getting happy.

ID=260102008
I told my father I lost the wrench that gave me a present.\nThen, with laughter I was told.

ID=260102009
"It seems you do not need that wrench anymore.\nIt is not a thing of another person, it means that you became a mechanic with just the technology of you ".

ID=260102010
... I'm happy.\nEver since I became the only mechanic "Eric" in this world.

ID=260102011
......

ID=260102012
Do you have this?

ID=260102013
I do not know if I'm in such a rag, but I'd like to present to you.\n... Although it may not be used, well, is it a proof of friendship? Haha.

ID=260102014
(Eric's feelings, let's receive it)

ID=260102015
Oh yeah, I have something I found with this.\nA card with stars drawn.

ID=260102016
... I do not know why this was with a wrench.\nIs not that the most popular trading cards?

ID=260102017
They're about to die around you, do not they? You can take it.\nWell ... I guess there was anything else ...?

ID=260102018
(If I was silent, I appealed that already enough baggage would be enough)

ID=260102019
Haha, I understand.\nWell then, I will go to work. I will call you if there is something good, expect it.

ID=260102020


ID=260102021
...%username%.\nCan you hear me?

ID=260102022
I am calling directly on your consciousness.\nIt is a prohibited method, but because I urgently need it, I chose this method.

ID=260102023
There was a strange thing.\n... I feel a history other than you from you.

ID=260102024
Have not you gotten anything strange recently?

ID=260102025
(I received an old wrench and suspicious card from Eric)

ID=260102026
... "vessel" and "proof of history".

ID=260102027
I did not think that you were already interfering with the history of others.\nI planned to tell you when the time comes, but let's fix the schedule.

ID=260102028
Things you receive are valuable to others, but it is different for you.\nThis can make your special power once more.

ID=260102029
The ability to "prove history" in "vessel" and "reproduce" its history.\nWe are calling it "A. R Card".

ID=260102030
All emotions, memories, incidents etc. engraved on the "proof of history" are stamped on "cardboard" in card form,\nYou can let it appear again in this world, or you can give special power to you.

ID=260102031
... Please try making A.R card under me.

ID=260102032
We look forward to.

ID=260102033


ID=660102001
(Let's visit Io)

ID=560102001
History of that person was engraved on this card.\nTo speak frankly, I did not think that I could make it so easily.

ID=460102001
Thanks to Eric.\nAfter all the strength of the bond always exceeds my expectations.

ID=460102002
If you decide to use the A.R card you made, that A.R card will be completely yours since.

ID=460102003
... That is to say your history will be even stronger.

ID=460102004
A. "Proof of history" that you can make R cards is hidden around here in this world.\nIt is also close to you, or one of you who is favorable to you.

ID=460102005
It is also the history of those who hostile or hate you.

ID=460102006
From now on for you to spin history ...\nWe need the power of A. R card engraved with the history of others.

ID=460102007
If you find the same thing, please visit me.\nLet's make a new A.R card that will be your strength.

ID=460102008
I keep watching over.\nThe uncertain history of eternity you spin ....

ID=230003501
Welcome.\nI am honored to have met you again.

ID=230003502
As you visited here,\nIt is time to sign a new contract.\nWho will sign a contract with you this time ....

ID=230003503
(Io seems to close your eyes and think deeply)

ID=230003504
... It is a person called "Zenith".

ID=230003505
It is the first time to sign a contract with a long-time person.

ID=230003506
This person is very difficult and cautious ....\n"The sense of refusal" to the reason is also expected to be correspondingly large.

ID=230003507
But you can do it.\nWhatever wish it is ....

ID=230003508
So it is almost time.\nPlease come and have a new contract with "Zenith".

ID=230003509
Anytime, anytime, it will be your power.

ID=630003501
I am looking forward to your new contract.

ID=330003501
Please bring me new promises with those "Zenith".\nIf you promise with that person, the contract will be established.

ID=300035101
Oh, the soul worker.\nI was thinking about talking once in the matter of the previous Ponkotsu Cleanie.

ID=300035102
That ... Thank you. Although I lied to me,\nSo it was soul worker who crossed the dangerous bridge in the end to help him ....

ID=300035103
I am grateful for that.\nBut even though I am good faith, will not you forgive me for a lie again?

ID=300035104
So what are you doing today?\nDid you have any sort of business?

ID=300035105
......

ID=300035106
Wow ... that means to me\n"It will be the power of soul worker at any time"\nDo you promise me?

ID=300035107
Well ... what happens if I say this is disgusting?\nBesides, have you decided how to say it?\nSomething ... I'm awfully embarrassed.

ID=300035108
Well, I also have a favor and there is nothing I can not do.\nSomething, I feel somewhat disgusted if I take it with a slight mind.

ID=300035109
Besides, it is not fun to do it so easily?

ID=300035110
So, will you let me entertain you?\nWhat I want my power is that I want the power of "making\

ID=300035111
Oh, how is this kind of?\nIf I try to be addicted to the fun of "production"\nI will do that "promise".

ID=300035112
How? You can not even do it, do not you?\nNow, how is it! lets do it? Will not you do it?

ID=300035113
Does it feel like leaving so much?\nmy mother. Really funny guy. Soul workers.

ID=300035114
Good night. I will give you a hint.

ID=300035115
When I just came here, I picked up a machine by "auto punching" by chance.\nI was playing around here with boredom, but I was thinking.\nWould not it be quite useful if this improved.

ID=300035116
There are only sacred sites of mechanics, the material is bad.\nIt is a bit dangerous.\nBesides, this situation stimulates my aesthetics.

ID=300035117
In a sacred place of mechanic, improve casual machine to the best machine.\nDo you understand? How cool this is!\nIt is my best to my aesthetics.

ID=300035118
Well, you know it soon, do not you?

ID=300035119
If you want my power, bring interesting materials that can demonstrate this power to its maximum.\nMy alchemy seems to shine only for Seoul workers ....

ID=300035120
Huh? You want a little more hints?\nWell, my mouth has become an expert.\nTo Did dealings with illegal merchants grow Seoul Workers?

ID=300035121
Well, I will serve you.

ID=300035122
Listen carefully, huh? There are two parts I want to improve "Auto Punisher".

ID=300035123
"Body" part and "Core" part.

ID=300035124
Actually, these two were woken up in the design drawing since I came to Ruin Fortress.\nMaybe you have already seen it?

ID=300035125
In addition, the direction of improvement of "body"\nCollect upgraded materials to the most common individuals,\nMake the strongest individual.

ID=300035126
Yes, here it is.

ID=300035127
By doing so, first find the material to improve the body part,\nPull out my alchemy.

ID=300035128
If it goes well, I will give you a hint of the core part.

ID=300035129
Let's do our best, then. Soul workers.

ID=300035601
Alright. Completion of "Body" Alchemy!

ID=300035602
To find out with such ambiguous hints properly,\nWell I guess I have eyes to see people.

ID=300035603
In this condition, the "core" part seems to be obtained without difficulty.

ID=300035604
The method is the same. We will get the material related to the "core" from the objects to be specified.\nHowever, this time we need high energy enough to restart Cleanie before.

ID=300035605
By doing so, energy of "near soul worker"\nTo convert to 'core' and bring it.

ID=300035606
that's all!\nYou already understood? Well, go ahead.

ID=300035001
Well ... and the "core" part is over.\nGood job.

ID=300035002
"Upgrade body component" and\n"Upgrade Core Component" will be received by me.

ID=300035003
Alright, please wait a moment.\nI will show you the best of my best!

ID=300035004
(From Zenith 's point of view, the intense light flushed away.\nMaterial collected up to now and "Auto Punisher" are wrapped in light floating in the air)

ID=300035005
(Parts find their own position swiftly flying around,\nI made "shape" in a blink of an eye)

ID=300035006
See you! Together!\nName it "Punisher: Zenith Custom"!

ID=300035007
What is your impression? Did you like my "alchemy"?

ID=300035008
Hehehe. Is it amazingly decided?\nWell, of course. Because it's just me.\nI like what it likes.

ID=300035009
Although it is a thing of Seoul Worker,\nIt does not make sense if the owner does not like it, is it?

ID=300035010
Hmm? What is it, boy. You said?\nMy power of what the soul worker says is "power"\nIt is not about "alchemy".

ID=300035011
I just did a "promise" reply to "my way of doing".\nI told you before, but I will only be a luggage in "battle".

ID=300035012
So I will protect Soul workers in my way.\nWhenever the result of my "alchemy" at any time,\nIt is supposed to be "power" of the soul worker.

ID=300035013
... Ah!! What a shame it is!\nI will never say it again!

ID=300035014
Look, I went when I finished my work!\nJust remembering, the fire will come out from the face.

ID=530003501
I confirmed the establishment of the contract.

ID=530003502
That person's word with you is with ....\nIt becomes a proof of an absolute contract,\nIt will be with you until that time your history will be lost.

ID=530003503
Huhu, this contract was "irregular".

ID=530003504
According to your new subscriber "Zenith"\n"Punisher: Zenith Custom" has been added as a new "supporter".

ID=430003501
I enjoyed it.\nThe new contractor is still interesting, is not it?

ID=430003502
I do not write my own history, but inscribe my "power" in other history ....\nHehe. No, I never thought that it would work like this.

ID=430003503
Thank you for a good time.\nWell, until the time we can see you again ... fine.

ID=230004001
O Konnichiha! %username%.

ID=230004002
... I came to mock a couple who taught reasons to a cleaning robot Deska?\nOr, accuse foolish babe who asked for funny things ...?

ID=230004003
It is Kudasai saying anything.\nI am a real "life form" ... No, I just wanted to be one "existence" Death.\nFor that, I will use ANATA. Elephant Tomo.

ID=230004004
... Thank you for your soul.

ID=230004005
%username%.\nI do not want to waste this place for nothing.\nBeyond what you think, Mr. I love Ruin Fortress and it's a mass.

ID=230004006
It is a story of the time when this was "Iron Fortress".\nDeath from the time when it was closed and became "Ruin Fortress".

ID=230004007
Because I was death at that time.

ID=230004008
When I was here Iron Fortress, I do not exist.\nAt that time, the main AI "Lucy" was only Node.

ID=230004009
In fact, the name Auxiliary AI "Jessie" does exist Mashita stops at development stage\nI can not get the role as that "auxiliary AI".

ID=230004010
I was remodeled in preparation for when "Lucy" was destroyed\nWakedes which was a clone of "Lucy".\nFrom form to character and ability all the same ... Yes, I do not have "reason".

ID=230004011
So, the first near soul worker "Zion" was all of the human beings at this base\nBy stopping life activities, we stopped development of "I" before "completion"\nIt is where you will not be born forever.

ID=230004012
Meanwhile, weapons for Near Soul Workers developed by Ned Company have appeared,\nDeath of Zion sealed deep underground. Waves of enormous force that occurred at that time,\nMake a malfunction in all the machines in this base.

ID=230004013
And at the moment of its malfunction,\nA miracle happened that Zion's wave was absorbed.\nI absorbed the wave and I was awakened by death.

ID=230004014
To that proof, I am different from the time of manufacturing,\nIt has a different form from "Lucy" and mass.

ID=230004015
And at that time ... I do not like to defend myself,\nRuin Fortress affiliation auxiliary AI ....\nCode named R-JS-021 "Jessie" Death.

ID=230004016
However, I was born accidentally and the development stopped halfway,\nSure decided to be irregular in "Lucy" of main AI,\nMasashita is sealed in the control consciousness of "Lucy".

ID=230004017
The problem is that the power of "Lucy" also\nIt was not in a state not perfect Node,\nIt is death that I was sealed with only "consciousness" of I.

ID=230004018
%username%. I just remember that time,\nA very scary death. I was not sealed until "consciousness"\nI have been seeing everything in Lucy 's consciousness for a long time.

ID=230004019
I can not go to other places, dekazu, mama can not do anything. Zut ...!

ID=230004020
Rather, I was able to "think" as an attachment of "Lucy\

ID=230004021
In the past Node where I was "attached" of "Lucy"\nTo the desire to become "presence" different from her,\nI thought that I felt 'anger' Ga,

ID=230004022
Now I feel Sen.\nI'm different from "Lucy" "presence" and became equal to her,\nDeath was feeling "angry" in the situation being oppressed.

ID=230004023
Because there was only awareness as "existence" in a situation where there was nothing to do,\nI felt angry at suppressed 'helplessness' Death.

ID=230004024
%username%.\nIntentional monoca, and also coincidentally ....\nNow "Zion" wakes up again in Ruin Fortress, Mata "Sealed" Masashita.

ID=230004025
I think ... Perhaps this time is the last chance that I can complete.

ID=230004026
Still as Deion 's hologram of Zion exists in the "building area".\nIt is the same as when I woke up in the past.

ID=230004027
The wave of enormous power that happened when Zion was sealed,\nRecalling the image of the previously recorded "Zion"\nDeath caused a strange phenomenon.

ID=230004028
... Do you understand what you want to say Masataka?\nIn other words, the aim of I: ....\nThe power of abnormal phenomenon that the hologram of that Zion has is death.

ID=230004029
Even with the power of a pure "near soul worker"\nIt is not the power of "Iron Fortress" too.\nThe two are "irregular" power death. It's as if you are YOUNNA.

ID=230004030
I need that power for me.\nI protect myself with the "existence" called I,\nDeath of power to become the true "main AI" of this "Ruin Fortress".

ID=230004031
If Narraba can be helped to gain that power,\n"Whenever you become the power of Anata at any time, it is a mass."

ID=230004032
"Promise" Simas.

ID=230004033
... Real deska? Really help me Deska?\nWow! ! ! Thank you!\nHey,%username%! My angel!

ID=230004034
Then, Zion of the hologram has\nWe gathered seven "Hologram Holding Energy" and it is Kudasai.\nTell me what you do when you come back.

ID=630004001
Please teach me ally.

ID=630004002
Well, Kiotsukete.

ID=330004001
Hologram Zion appearing in "Construction Facilities"\nCollect seven "Hologram Holding Energy".\nNanitozodes.

ID=300040201
Welcome home Nasai. %username%.\nPlease give me "Hologram Holding Energy" you got.

ID=300040202
(Pass 7 "Hologram Holding Energy" to Jessie)

ID=300040203
After all, it was a bigger force than we had calculated.\nAlthough it is perfect for the wavelength of the power of I.\nThank you for getting such a dangerous thing, thank you.

ID=300040204
What else would I do with this ... was it Yone?

ID=300040205
There are two answers to that question, mass.

ID=300040206
The first one. This energy is converted to the wavelength of I,\nI will change it to the power to protect myself.

ID=300040207
The second. Condensed the remaining power except the force into a form of 7 keys,\nInstalled on the control system of the entire Ruin Fortress.\nGet control here.

ID=300040208
Why control Domica? Souldesney ....\nThere is also a need to protect Ruin Fortress here and there is a trout.\nDeath g ...

ID=300040209
It is also necessary to delete all the remaining "Lucy" data area.

ID=300040210
Although the function as AI has already been destroyed,\nLucy's remaining consciousness still remains in italt koros.\nDelete all of them, and indeed become the "main AI" here in Death.

ID=300040211
Andastan did it?

ID=300040212
Good luck.\nThen believe that the next request will also surely help you.\nI will make make materials for that, so Shibasimata.

ID=300040213
(As soon as I finished speaking, Jesse's body shone and disappeared)

ID=300040214
First of all, please accept these six keys.

ID=300040215
As I talked about these six keys and the master key I plan to make later,\nKEEDES with the power to control Ruin Fortress.

ID=300040216
I will put these into the installation equipment that I will generate from now\nIf you let me insert it Banbanzai des.\nInstallation equipment appeared in the main spot of Ruin Fortress and mass.

ID=300040217
Position should be displayed on the operation device.

ID=300040218
First of all, with these six keys "construction facility\\n"Internal laboratory\\nPlease access the installation equipment of "main power room".

ID=300040219
Well, Nanitozo please mass.

ID=300040901
Confirm that installation of 6 areas is completed.\nThanks for moving as requested, thank you.

ID=300040902
Finally, final death.

ID=300040903
This is the installation key "Master Key" Death with Ichiban 's power.\nI made it only for the control of the central control room.

ID=300040904
The central control room is the place that governs the most authority in Ruin Fortress ... ...\nA place indicating the beginning and the end of "AI".

ID=300040905
Also, the formatted "AI" is also a place to stop and it is a square.

ID=300040906
"Lucy" which was "main AI" is also stopped there, Mashita.

ID=300040907
Therefore, there is an important place in Totemo.\nSo stopping there means that "residual consciousness" was born from there as well.

ID=300040908
Please connect this master key to the installation device in the central control room.\nSo, everything is finish.

ID=300040909
This is Final Onegai.

ID=530004001
Successful acquisition of authority of central control room.

ID=530004002
Thank you,%username%, sincerely thank you.\nthank you! !

ID=530004003
With this, it is not necessary to have a narrow mind as a "supplementary AI"\nYou do not have to be scared by invading the remaining area of ​​"Lucy" Mashita.

ID=530004004
This is really freedom des!\nI'm finally ready for Masashi!

ID=530004005
All thanks to%username%.

ID=530004006
Promised Simas.\nIt becomes power of you at any moment and mass.

ID=530004007
It is Kudasai to receive this.

ID=530004008
(I received "supporter: Lucy" from Jessie)

ID=530004009
Surprised Shitaka? I can surprise you from facial expressions Massenet.

ID=530004010
Musca is concerned about how I made it?\nEasy Death. Mashayonone exchanging "promise" shortly before requesting this time.

ID=530004011
At that time, the power of the same quality as what I was given was born.\nBecause it was an unprecedented and unusual phenomenon, save it, Mashita.

ID=530004012
We organized the remaining consciousness of Lucy collected by installing%username% 's installation key,\nOnce created in log form, such results occurred.

ID=530004013
I thought that the more familiar force is easier to use, so try ingenuity Shitaga,\nDeath, as if it was correct.

ID=530004014
Such a situation is called "Tanabota" Death Yune?

ID=530004015
The place where the power which made this made a deska?\nMoshira, using some of the power we gathered this time, Mashita.

ID=530004016
Thanks a little for me.\nIt was a good death. Even if I do not need any more gymnasts, it is a corner mass.

ID=530004017
Why "Lucy" is anxious and Musca?\nThat is ....

ID=530004018
Although I was suppressed by her, although she lived, she wanted to seal her in consciousness of myself,\nI want to erase completely and I do not want to discard it.

ID=530004019
Although it is deformed, is it because of the prototype of I. "Lucy" ....\nDeath so that she can not touch her.

ID=530004020
So, she and I also chose a way to be free from each other.

ID=530004021
%username% can get new power,\n"Lucy's consciousness" leaves here and becomes free,\nI am completely free from her and can be independent and deskara.

ID=530004022
If it is all good, is it all good Debow?\nNe?

ID=530004023
I'm glad I could serve you.\nSince I made it with difficulty, please use firmly.\nShe should seriously support%username% 's deskara.

ID=530004024
%username%.

ID=530004025
Where are you going away and going far away, death?\nWe have been supporting me forever,\nThank you very much for listening to my request.

ID=530004026
Thank you for surviving here in Ruin Fortress.\nDeath of you was not recorded, it was really good death.

ID=530004027
I do not know when.\nBy the day that you come back here again,\nI also control this perfectly and show me Masuyo.

ID=430004001
Until then, please be happy please!

ID=430004002
(Jessy turned into sleep mode very happily)

ID=430004003
(I do not worry about it anymore)

ID=260149701
Oh, that reminds me, there was contact from Loco Town before you came.\nI will contact from Major Benjamin, but ... do you remember steel grave?

ID=260149702
so. It is the place where you got the test after you fell out of the blank.\nThe steel grave virtual reality battle program is likely to be available as the repair is over.

ID=260149703
... I mean, what do you mean that program overheats?\nWell, I should not bother with a considerable amount of energy.

ID=260149704
Anyhow, it seems that you have strengthened the performance extensively with what you broke.\nEven the official information has arrived.

ID=260149705
Well ... equipped with accuracy AI and various battle programs. Why do not you try your power ...?\n... What is the comment like this shopping advertisement ....

ID=260149706
I have something else written.\nThis seems to be an explanation about ... operation method ....

ID=260149707
Well ... something complicated ....

ID=260149708
Briefly, Steel grave is operated in chapter units.\nThere seems to be 5 stages for each chapter.

ID=260149709
It seems that you can go to the next chapter by clearing all five stages belonging to the chapter.\n... I see, I feel like going up the stairs one by one.

ID=260149710
It also says that if you clear the chapter 5 test, it will give you a special reward.\nThe contents of the reward ... It seems like a design map of Seoul Weapon and gear made based on collected battle data.

ID=260149711
The explanation got longer, in short, that kind of thing.

ID=260149712
Anyway, if you go inside and break it all you'll get some kind of reward.

ID=260149713
And here is the most important part ....\nSteel grave can only enter once a day.

ID=260149714
Once it goes in, you can only test one chapter.\nIt will take a day to collect and analyze battle data.

ID=260149715
Well probably because of some sort of stupid soul worker\nI think that it is also to prevent overheating.

ID=260149716
The test partner seems to be made based on the enemy data that you have fought so far.\nI'm pretty sure that the degree of reproduction is high, so if you enter with a light feeling it may be painful eyes.

ID=260149717
Well, the contents are almost like this.

ID=260149718
... How? Interested?\nChallenge to steel grave.

ID=660149701
Why not? Why do not you go?\nI am busy, but I can give you about it.

ID=660149702
Oh, please report on the degree of achievement at HEMS.\nData is important.

ID=360149701
Once you go to steel grave and get ramped?\nDo not forget to report on HEMS.

ID=560149701
I cleared the chapter 5 of steel grave. Thank you for your hard work.\nBased on the important battle data you provided, we will endeavor to become a higher level of Star Forest Association.

ID=460149701
Thank you very much. I am waiting for the use of another.

ID=260150001
I had talked to you over.\nActually Steel grave information seems to be updated.

ID=260150002
It seems that already heard the steel grave in the story heard.\nHow is it? Would you like to try again?

ID=260150003
The new AI added this time seems to be mainly Seoul Junk.\nIt seems that you reproduced Soul junk you fought at Kandas city as it was.

ID=260150004
Although the hardship memory may revive ....\n... One from me, I will have a boring advice.

ID=260150005
I can not solve the hard memory by forgetting it.\nAlways remember and have to face each other.

ID=260150006
It is strange that the human mind is ... as much as a frustrating and sad memory\nIf you face each other without running away, you will get used to it before you unexpectedly.

ID=260150007
You had better get used to it as soon as possible.\nI face the memories that bother you from the front.\nAt first it will be easier if time passes.

ID=260150008
... The story has become long.\nI just thought of talking about battle program. Ha ha ha.

ID=260150009
I will prepare the steel grave. It is up to you whether you do not do it or not.\nIf you get motivated, you can look at the past with steel grave.

ID=660150001
Face the past and accept it.

ID=360150001
It is up to you whether you do not do it or not. I will prepare the steel grave.\nIf you get motivated, you can look at the past with steel grave.

ID=560150001
I cleared the chapter 10 of steel grave. Thank you for your hard work.\nBased on the important battle data you provided, we will endeavor to become a higher level of Star Forest Association.

ID=460150001
Thank you very much. I am waiting for the use of another.

ID=260150501
Umm, as I can no longer interview the alchemist,\nI have no other choice but to look for other stuff.

ID=260150502
Disagreeable. Am I going to ask the alchemist directly and ask ...?

ID=260150503
Well, not bad ... I do not know how to go and get it done.\nIt may be remodeled into android. I will become a special man.

ID=260150504
All right! Let's change feelings and try to reveal the corruption of the Star Forest Union!

ID=260150505
Exhibit the corruption of the Star Forest Alliance, which is called a symbol of good from people, human hope!

ID=260150506
Before this, anonymous information arrived.\nIt is about the achievement fee of the unexpected mission which the Star Forest Alliance grants to the men.

ID=260150507
Hmm? Do not you know the unexpected mission?\nHey ... did not anyone explain it?

ID=260150508
Those who belong to the Star Forest Alliance may suddenly be given new duties during the mission.\nThe aim is to confirm flexible thought ability and coping ability.

ID=260150509
This burst of mission seems to be quite difficult.\nBecause it is so? Even though the existing mission alone is enough to kill, another mission comes in additionally.

ID=260150510
However, when this unexpected task is achieved, a predetermined compensation is received from the Star Forest Alliance.\nIt is a reward in the form of a small box, but contains things that are useful for combat.

ID=260150511
Anonymous information is about this box.\nThere are nothing in it, and things that are not usable are all included.

ID=260150512
It is necessary to investigate this subject a little.\nIf the information is true, the credibility of the Star Forest Alliance falls to the ground ....

ID=260150513
I recognized the achievement of revealing it, and also to the PD of Lion TV ...!\nHa ha ha! Do not get excited just thinking about it!

ID=260150514
Well, you belong to the Star Forest Alliance, right?\nPlease earn rewards for that emergency mission as soon as possible!\nBecause I open the box directly and check the contents!

ID=260150515
(... I do not think he will listen even if I defend the Star Forest Alliance. I will take a fee in the meantime)

ID=660150501
Cookoo ... Wahaha!\nHope comes to PD! President of the broadcasting station is close!

ID=360150501
Please earn rewards for that emergency mission as soon as possible!\nI will prove the corruption of the Star Forest Union by examining the contents to every corner!

ID=560150501
(I handed a secret box to Perry)

ID=560150502
Oh! This!\nJust check inside and ...!

ID=560150503
(Perry began to open the box as though possessed by something)

ID=560150504
Well ....

ID=560150505
(Perry opened another box)

ID=560150506
Well ....

ID=560150507
......

ID=560150508
... and very good things are included.\nIt seems to give me a good price if I take it to a shop.

ID=560150509
... After all ... is not it ...?

ID=560150510
Huh

ID=560150511
... I'm sorry.

ID=460150501
... No, not yet ...!\nsomething ...! There must be something!

ID=460150502
I do not see anything now ... I bet there must be something good article story!\nThink ... thinking ...! The reinstatement is before my eyes ...!

ID=460150503
......

ID=460150504
... I will call you again when a good idea comes up.\nEven then I will be able to help you. What? What?

ID=460150505
What happened? Why do not you get reply?\n"Of course," you only need these five letters? Say?

ID=260151001
Hey ....\nHey, hey ...!

ID=260151002
Here, this will be the best scoop!\nThere is no doubt this time!

ID=260151003
There is certain evidence that uncovers the corruption of the Star Forest Union ...!

ID=260151004
......

ID=260151005
... ask!\nJust think again that you are deceived and just give me a hand!

ID=260151006
(There is no choice but to help again)

ID=260151007
Ha ha ha! I thought you would lend me your strength!\n... Perhaps the best scoop for my life may be your existence itself.

ID=260151008
Anyway, this time the target is "S coin".\nIt is only given to members who carried out special missions.

ID=260151009
The special mission is a kind of arrangement made by the Star Forest Alliance.\n"Because the number of soul junks is increasing, let's punit" "Because problems are occurring with x, solve it."\nAnd so on.

ID=260151010
The special mission is to actively reflect the opinions of noncombatants, or civilians.\nWhen they get informed, they are used to process it.

ID=260151011
But, I think you also know, but now the Star Forest Union has not enough troops to handle it.\nSo, the Stary Forest Alliance put out the contents of the report in the form of a notice form and put it on the bulletin board.

ID=260151012
It is free whether you do it or not. It 's up to you.\nHowever, it is the point of the special mission system that if you carry out your duties you pay the remuneration firmly.

ID=260151013
The special mission 's "S coin" is special coin inside the coalition.\nYou can purchase goods that are not on the market.

ID=260151014
Each S coin has its own unique identification code, it is impossible for forgery ... but!\nI got some information about this!

ID=260151015
Apparently, there seems to be something that the identification code does not work properly!\nIn other words, it means that fakes are on the market. ... And, by the hands of the coalition!

ID=260151016
What if the reward for problem solving is actually fake?\nHow is it? Does the scoop smell?

ID=260151017
(I answered that it did not do it at all)

ID=260151018
Like ...! ! you! ! It will smell crowded!\nThe smell of the big scoop is pretty!

ID=260151019
... Well, lend me your strength.\nBecause it is the last ... I will not ask for it anymore ... Now ....

ID=660151001
Is it true? Thank you!\nIt is truly my greatest luck in my life that I met you!

ID=660151002
Collect S coins! I bought an identification code tracking device,\nYou can easily check if it is the correct code!

ID=660151003
Good luck!\nBecause it is really the end of this!

ID=360151001
Collect S coins!\nI will check to see if it can be used truly!

ID=560151001
Did you come together?

ID=560151002
Well ... this S coin to the identification code tracking device ...!

ID=560151003
......

ID=560151004
No, let's stop it ....

ID=560151005
If I think about it, I was a temporary PD ....\nI was dedicated to creating and exploring new things.

ID=560151006
I was shining so brightly, but now I'm looking for someone else ....\nIt's a long way down.

ID=560151007
Therefore, let's stop it already.\nI thought that you have to change by looking at your appearance of running so hard.

ID=560151008
Honesty does not disappoint ... It is the word my senpai said. It is the perfect word for you now.\nI think that I will live again in good faith again.

ID=560151009
I do not know whether I will continue this work, though ....\nWell anyway, I will think about various things.

ID=560151010
... It is my greatest luck in my life that I saw you The story is true.\nIt was a short time, but I learned a lot.

ID=560151011
Let's meet again!\nAt that time, I will show you a little strange!

ID=460151001
......

ID=460151002
... By the way, do you have a little money?\nI used it all when I bought an identification code tracking device ....

ID=460151003
(... go home)

ID=460151004
Hey, hey!\nWait a moment!

ID=260149501
Hey! %username% ~!

ID=260149502
I finally found it! The real culprit of radio interference.\nIt was not Zenith!

ID=260149503
Well, let's quiet down once.\n... I thought Zennis's radio wave jammers were disturbing strengthening,\nNot only that.

ID=260149504
No, the interference signal of the radio interference device\nIt does not have much impact on strengthening ....

ID=260149505
Sending a strong jamming signal to the surroundings,\nThere are some guys who add noise to the reinforcement signal of me!

ID=260149506
In other words, this is the "real criminal of radio interference" that this guy was looking for!

ID=260149507
Actually, when this formerly installed Zenith 's radio wave jammer improved,\nI set up a radio wave generation area tracker so that I will never receive jamming radio waves again.

ID=260149508
If you try reverse detection using it ...!\nHe was a hit "Genocider X" in the internal laboratory!

ID=260149509
I only have to defeat him ....

ID=260149510
... but he seems to get hurt just by approaching.\nIt seems difficult to hide secretly and hack ....

ID=260149511
So, I wonder if you can help me a bit ... Oh ~.

ID=260149512
Please! I will pay the reward properly.\nCan you defeat the real criminal of radio interference?

ID=260149513
You hear a metal sound from the disturbing signal sent by him ....\nIt will become a neurosis if it is as it is!

ID=260149514
Hey? Does it work? Is not it?

ID=660149501
Thank you,%username%!\nI can count on you!

ID=360149501
Well then, I asked!

ID=360149502
I want you to knock down the real criminal "Jennosider X" of radio interference.\nI am at the entrance to the internal laboratory!\nDo it again so as not to give off jamming signals!

ID=560149501
Well, let's try working on it ~.

ID=560149502
(You hear a small signal sound from Trisha's machine)

ID=560149503
There was no disturbing signal, but another signal ...?\nWell ... Is it a signal from the Starry Forest Alliance?

ID=560149504
Well, that's not a big deal.\nIt's okay it's okay!

ID=560149505
(When Trisha touched the machine a little, the signal sound disappeared)

ID=560149506
Oh! The signal disappeared!\nHe seems to have been the perpetrator.

ID=560149507
Fu, I can finally concentrate and get a job.\nI owe it to you. %username%!

ID=460149501
Thank you very much!

ID=210066501
You lost your mind and did not remember it properly?\nA golden woman? What on earth are you talking about?

ID=210066502
Do you remember that Zion gave a toy called%username%?\nI liked it very much and I was playing. Haha.

ID=210066503
... Fuu.\nI apologize instead.

ID=210066504
I apologize.\nBut what does all the data blow ... What happened?

ID=210066505
...? What?\nData blew away ...?

ID=210066506
... While the monitoring of the arc - ship was not working,\nSuddenly the shock wave of energy covered the entire Ruin Fortress.\nAfter that, all data accumulated so far has disappeared.

ID=210066507
Have you pressed a button on something by mistake?

ID=210066508
There is not it! That's not it.

ID=210066509
EMP or something did not freeze the electronics, just the data disappeared?

ID=210066510
Yeah ... That's right.

ID=210066511
... How can I believe the story of Amanda?

ID=210066512
Why should I be angry?

ID=210066513
I am not angry.\nAll the data accumulated using LXT has disappeared ... just as I am concerned.

ID=210066514
Valuable data that may have raised the technology level of the entire Crow Dream several steps ....\nI want to know the reason why it disappeared.

ID=210066515
It's obviously not funny.\nI will not let the data be extinguished without affecting others.

ID=210066516
... After all I am angry.

ID=210066517
......\nFuu ....

ID=210066518
All right.\nThere are some losses, but you can recover with logs left by version.

ID=210066519
Oh, the logs are all gone.

ID=210066520
Become Like someone else's like that ...!

ID=210066521
What do you say to me!\nIt disappeared! I did not do anything but pawn!

ID=210066522
Because I did not do anything, it disappeared!

ID=210066523
So, what should I do!

ID=210066524
Well, it will calm down.\nIt is noisy.

ID=210066525
I can not understand Dr. Sarah's feelings.\nHowever, the aim is to secure a near soul worker to the last.\nDo not forget it.

ID=210066526
And Amanda chan.\nOthers can leave it alone and can you search for the response of near soul workers?

ID=210066527
Abel and Noah, Enoch 's reaction can be grasped inside.\nBut the reaction of Zion has completely disappeared.

ID=210066528
That's right.\nZion must have disappeared when something happened at the arc - ship.

ID=210066529
Hey, you have to tell me that? Can you stop?

ID=210066530
Data and Zion disappeared at the same time as monitoring became impossible ....\nDo not smell ... A dubious smell gets fucked hard.\nIt seems that the parties who were on the scene were also warmly welcomed.

ID=210066531
Well, we just do our duties.\nNear soul worker securing strategy.

ID=210066532
Oops ... I have to tell the change order.\n%username%, you are fired.

ID=210066533
Why you ask?\nIt was confirmed that the near soul worker did not have hostility.

ID=210066534
Only Zion where there was danger was missing ....\nWe approach them in a peaceful way.

ID=210066535
To embrace ... and?

ID=210066536
That's it.\nThere is no need to stick a muzzle to a child without hostility.

ID=210066537
Pay close attention.\nYour presence is dangerous in this operation.

ID=210066538
It is you that attacked them while saying that there was no hostility.\nI will stimulate them strangely.

ID=210066539
... and then.\nYou look terrible terrible.

ID=210066540
Embarrassment that we can not understand the loss of despair and the situation ....\nI will withstand it.

ID=210066541
Good luck on this occasion.\nYou will need a vacation.

ID=610066501
Is it okay to decide such a thing?

ID=610066502
Amanda, I'm the commander?\nI have authority to give me a vacation.

ID=610066503
Oh yeah, Arcship will be collected in the Star Forest Alliance.\nIt is the first airship to which LXT is seriously connected. It seems that they intend to use it well.

ID=610066504
And one more thing.\nIt seems that abnormal phenomena are occurring here and there after you are slaughtered by Zion.

ID=610066505
Small blanks appear to occur around the western part of Crow Dream.\n... What should I do if this happens? Do not understand.

ID=610066506
Well, since the person himself is the most frustrating, do not say anything more than this.\nSo please enjoy a little vacation.

ID=610066507
... I do not think I'm resting silently.

ID=610066508
Come on! Search is started!\nThe data is blown and it starts again from the beginning, but there is no choice but to do it!

ID=310066501
... You are on vacation.\nI do not mind if I do not need it ... If you're planning on a vacation do not come here. It will be enviable.

ID=100665101
I heard the story. It seems that you lost your first defeat.\nA phenomenon of unknown cause also occurred, and the situation changed rapidly irrespective of my intention.

ID=100665102
Well, I think that I had a good experience.\nSometimes I do not know without defeat.

ID=100665103
And the events of the world are not all those that occur in the categories of understanding.\nEspecially for people like us.

ID=100665104
... Apparently, she seems to have a vacation.\nIt seems there is only me who can be your strength. It will be good. Try to talk.

ID=100665105
......

ID=100665106
A woman wearing a golden armor and treating a spear?

ID=100665107
... Fufu.

ID=100665108
... There is no idea at all.

ID=100665109
The easiest way to deal with you who afflicted you ...?\nIs it a soul worker ...? No, what I heard such as those with such power ... Benelis is a man ....

ID=100665110
Orca troops or ESP troops ... No, they have no reason to go to Ruin Fortress ....\nIs it a woman ... Yujin? No ... Yuzin should be wearing armor etc ....

ID=100665111
Uoohoo ....

ID=100665112
... I'm coming, I'm going ~?

ID=100665113
Sedulin?\nOh ... it's already such a time.

ID=100665114
Yup. Everyone is waiting ~.

ID=100665115
Women in the example?

ID=100665116
I think I arrived at the very beginning, but ~?

ID=100665117
Whoops? If someone thinks it is new, is not it?\nHow are you?

ID=100665118
I heard that it is on vacation ~. Why are you here?\nIf you do not have time, I will go with you ~ ~? Who are you going to meet?

ID=100665119
Sedurin.

ID=100665120
Oh, that reminds me of being top secret ~?\nWell ... Well, maybe you can say it is a newcomer? I also do a strictly confidential mission.

ID=100665121
I'm on vacation.

ID=100665122
Well, that's right ~ ne. You have to take a day off on vacation.\nWell then, we are a bit busy ~. Can I talk later?

ID=100665123
It is a lot of fuss because abnormal whites occur in many places.\nSo, talk later later?

ID=100665124
... sorry.\nWait a moment. Right back.

ID=100665125
......

ID=100665126
by the way ....\nMy "logger" was wearing golden clothes.

ID=100665127
It is "Io". You will also be there.\nWhy do not you ask them over there?

ID=100665128
...?\nWhat are you talking about?

ID=100665129
No, this is the story.

ID=100665130
What is it ~. Soul workers' story of Nai ~?\nAnyway, quickly go ~. Senia will get angry ~.

ID=100665131
Well, let's meet later.

ID=100665132
Ah, cheerful.\nLong time no see ... I mean, is not it?

ID=100665133
Armor?\n... Do not worry. I will not run away.

ID=100665134
... This muscle stupid.

ID=510066501
You came.\nI was waiting.

ID=510066502
I thought it would take some more time ....\nThat's right.

ID=510066503
Little by little, it is bent from the future I saw.\nHuh ... ... it is interesting.

ID=510066504
Let me tell you what you want to know.\nIt is subject to the condition that ... within the range allowed by me.

ID=510066505
Roscar is the name of a man wearing golden armor.\nIt is as close as possible to the gods you say.

ID=510066506
It is also the source of the power of those who use the power of the other world as well as those who fight in Seoul.

ID=510066507
Also, she waits ....\nIt is a presence waiting until the world's gears naturally mesh and the world's axis turns.

ID=510066508
Her original plan is to nurture your power until the world's axis turns.

ID=510066509
You still have no power to guide her "scenario" ....\nAlso, the gear that meshes with you has too much power.

ID=510066510
She was going to wait as it was.\nUntil your power equals or exceeds the gear ....

ID=510066511
It is because the grace was still left before the gear started moving.

ID=510066512
However, the steady desire of a certain boy caused an irregular,\nThere was a situation where the gears began to forcibly start turning.

ID=510066513
Hehe ... is not it really interesting?\nHuman desperate wish drives the plan close to God crazy ....

ID=510066514
She can not afford to lose you has broken the promise from long ago.\nPromise not to interfere directly with the world ....

ID=510066515
Therefore, other existence started to move.

ID=510066516
Promises are those with whom you exchanged.\nThe partner who made a promise with her, "Kant" conflicts with her who controls "order".

ID=510066517
As an excuse that she interfered with the world, he also began to intervene in the world.

ID=510066518
Eventually, he also opened a different "book\

ID=510066519
Irregular calls for further irregular ... ...\nThe axis of the world that begins to turn around in a distant future has been forcibly started.

ID=510066520
You have to work hard.\nTo guide the scenario she draws ....

ID=510066521
The stage for that is prepared.

ID=510066522
Twist of the world which he made by opening a book ... ....\nGo up there and raise your strength.

ID=510066523
......

ID=510066524
That is where I can talk.\nIf you talk more, she may notice my existence ....

ID=510066525
I know her, but she does not know me.\nI am looking at the world as a complete third party, deviated from the axis of the world to the last.

ID=510066526
Contact with you is only a small entertainment.\nIf it interferes with the world any more, it will not be a third party ....

ID=510066527
... Someday the time when the future I saw could completely warp,\nI may not be a third party, but may jump into the world ... but hehe.

ID=510066528
I will put my strength.\nIn preparation for the big stage coming soon ....

ID=510066529
I will wait.

ID=510066530
A day when you gloriously dance on her stage ....

ID=410066501
Please tell me when you are ready.\nLet me show you where the twist of the world has occurred.

ID=260151501
A small town where you first aroused.\nI feel the twist of the world from there.

ID=260151502
Why do not you visit people connected to your history ...?\nThey will be aware of such heterogeneous phenomena.

ID=260151503
Please listen to detailed stories from them.

ID=660151501
Then, that you do not have great power ....

ID=360151501
Please visit those people connected to your history.\nYou'd better listen to detailed stories from them.

ID=601515101
How is it because we operate the personnel in two parts?\nAlthough it takes load, I think that it is not bad if only search is purpose.

ID=601515102
No ... Although support came, the strength is insufficient.\nIt is suicidal act to divide the force in this situation.

ID=601515103
I agree with Major's opinion. There is a high possibility that it will end with not being able to solve anything.

ID=601515104
I think that is not bad, but?\nRisk will also be reduced if the purpose is limited to searching ... and.

ID=601515105
It may be so if normal. However, in the case of abnormal blanks, the search itself may not be established.\nIt is unknown whether it can enter.

ID=601515106
In that case, the report comes from Grace City.\nI heard that abnormal whitespace is no different from existing space.

ID=601515107
I heard that report.\nBut inside that ....

ID=601515108
......

ID=601515109
So I am concerned that the search itself will not be established.\nRisk is too high.

ID=601515110
You can not do anything if you are afraid of danger.\nEspecially in the current situation ....

ID=601515111
If you have an idea how much danger will be involved, you do not understand any circumstances at all.

ID=601515112
(It seems that the four people are absorbed in the strategy meeting and are not aware that they are nearby.\nLet's give a little indication)

ID=601515113
Then ... how about this one.\nAttach the camera to the training dummy and let it enter. First of all, grasp the situation ....

ID=601515114
Your

ID=601515115
Oh?

ID=601515116
......

ID=601515117
Hm, not bad.\nOK, now I'm planning a strategy ....

ID=601515118
%username%?\nWhat's wrong ....

ID=601515119
Long time no see, eh! What's wrong?\nI thought you were in Ruin Fortress.

ID=601515120
......

ID=601515121
I came to play ... It is not likely to be translated.\nFor what?

ID=601515122
(Saying you want to enter an abnormal blank)

ID=601515123
To abnormal blank ...?\nSurely now I am bothered by that story ....

ID=601515124
There is no reason to stop saying go.\nIndependent behavior would be familiar.

ID=601515125
However, it is a very dangerous place.\nWithout a reason for it, it can easily be permitted ....

ID=601515126
L think it is good?

ID=601515127
I agree with that.\nLet's send.

ID=601515128
Muu ....

ID=601515129
There is a reason.\nSomething we can not tell ....

ID=601515130
... It seems like that.

ID=601515131
......

ID=601515132
Alright, allow entry.\nLet the position be communicated to the operator.

ID=601515133
However, there is one condition.\nLike to report internal situation.

ID=601515134
It came at a good timing.\nActually, the location of the puppet production facility under investigation turned out, it was planned to introduce troops.

ID=601515135
But, suddenly an abnormal white space occurred, did not it? That's why I was in trouble.\nI do not know the circumstances, but I will ask you again.

ID=601515136
I hope you find what you are looking for.\nBut do not overdo it.

ID=601515137
Take care.\nbe careful.

ID=560151501
Well, I came back with a cool face ....\nI was worried and lost. ... Anything.

ID=560151502
You seem to have returned.\nWhat was going on inside?

ID=560151503
......

ID=560151504
What, there was a doll ...? Did a doll similar to a clown of a blue flame have been led?\nI thought that the space was also mixed.

ID=560151505
... There are no reports that dolls were absorbed in the blanks at the moment.

ID=560151506
It would be reasonable to see that it was not actually.

ID=560151507
Is that ... ... you imitated?

ID=560151508
Oh ... Based on the "information" of the area where the blank occurred,\nI guess they did imitate objects with power.

ID=560151509
Major. That means ....

ID=560151510
No, I can not be sure.\nBad judgment is prohibited.

ID=560151511
... As far as the situation is concerned, it looks almost certain.

ID=460151501
Anyway, it was hard work.\nIt seems that the army who headed to the production facility has also achieved results. It is likely to be able to raise a decent report for the first time in a while.

ID=460151502
... For abnormal whitespace, report down to the details.

ID=260152001
Where the twist of the world is perceived ...\nIt is the place that made you feel sorrowful.

ID=260152002
The place where new power wakes up, switching sadness ....\nSo please seek help from people connected with your history.

ID=260152003
They should be aware of the twist of the world ....\nPlease listen to detailed stories.

ID=660152001
Well then, I wish to have a great power ....

ID=360152001
Please seek help from people connected with your history.\nThey should be aware of the twist of the world ....

ID=601520101
that? What's wrong?\nAlso asking for assistance?

ID=601520102
I told you before, but it is not right now.\nThe situation is getting worse than before.

ID=601520103
Er, is not it?\nWell then, what for you to this place?

ID=601520104
Unusual blank ...?\nWait a moment, you ... you know what you mean?

ID=601520105
The dimension is different from the previous place.\nBlank, blank! Nobody knows what will happen inside!

ID=601520106
There is no information nor support.\nNo matter how hard you are ... you can not send it to such a place!

ID=601520107
There is no information at all.

ID=601520108
Chu, Colonel ...?\nUnnoticature ...?

ID=601520109
It is just now. It is returning to the front with Victor.\nLong time no see,%username%. Were they talented?

ID=601520110
Long time no see,%username%.\nHe was listening to his success. Really tired.

ID=601520111
block. Please tell%username% what you learned about anomalous blanks.\nThere is nothing left to do ....

ID=601520112
......

ID=601520113
It seems that Seoul Junk is setting up in large numbers.\nThat ... too much stronger than the guys you have killed so far.

ID=601520114
I tried a few battles, but I could not give any damage.\nI did not even earn time.

ID=601520115
... Even if you said so far, are you going?\nFor what?

ID=601520116
Reason ...? Somehow I understand.

ID=601520117
... What.

ID=601520118
To kill Catherine's enemy ... Kana?\nI heard that Henry's pursuit moved to another unit.

ID=601520119
Are you going to annihilate Seoul Junk?\nFor Katherine ....

ID=601520120
I want to kill soul junk and dedicate it to the grave of Catherine.\nSo it goes to anomalous blank ... is not it natural?

ID=601520121
......

ID=601520122
Because we are moving for that ....\nYou ... I was particularly close with Katherine.

ID=601520123
......

ID=601520124
Colonel Aaron. Please give me approval.\nUnfortunately, in the current Burning Red MK II, it will not be the opponent of Soul Junk, an unusual blank.

ID=601520125
But if you are called Seoul Junk's nightmare ....\nBattle capability comes with origami.

ID=601520126
Of course. There is no reason to object.\n%username% ... Let's allow you to enter anomalous space.

ID=601520127
Give Seoul Junk and others judgment of justice.

ID=601520128
......

ID=601520129
%username%.\nbe careful.

ID=601520130
I will ask you.\nI will return home safely ....

ID=560152001
... I returned.

ID=560152002
To say that returning ... annihilated the abnormal blank soul junk.\nIt was a hard time. Catherine will be pleased as well.

ID=560152003
I can not just be happy.\nWe have to strengthen Burning Red MK II based on enemy data ....

ID=560152004
Can you do it right now?

ID=560152005
of course. Because there are dozens of strengthening plans just by thinking.\nI'm running out because I want to experiment.

ID=560152006
Then, there is no reason to delay further.\nIs Seoul Junk used for experiment prepared?

ID=560152007
Yes. Anesthesia bullet for Seoul junk has more than expected effect.\nEven soul junk already captured will be quite a few.

ID=560152008
I guess that guinea pigs are ready at all ....\nThen we have to hurry.

ID=560152009
%username%.\nIt will be rude soon.

ID=560152010
It was a pain.\nYou must be tired. Take a break for a while.

ID=460152001
(Aaron and Victor have left with a fast pace)

ID=460152002
......

ID=460152003
... everyone was crazy.\nIt was crazy ....

ID=460152004
%username%.\nI ... What should I do?

ID=460152005
The two of them are just hitting the anger who lost their visit to Seoul Junk ....\nWhat can I do next to them ... What?

ID=460152006
The two of them sleep only two hours a day. We do not look for troop operations or interpersonal relationships.\nHowever, what do you say you can do for them who think only of Seoul Junk's death?

ID=460152007
Using the captured Soul Junk for experimenting with new weapons,\nI am talking happily about the result ....

ID=460152008
Even though it is Seoul Junk who fought to live ... for them it is only subject to massacres.\nWell, what kind of face do I face against them?

ID=460152009
Haha ... really crazy.\nFrom the side I am saying ... I am going to lose my sense.

ID=460152010
It's madness that started with love ....\nI wonder if I will have it ....

ID=460152011
Fu ... I'm sorry.\nTo say extra things ....

ID=460152012
Now, leave here.\nLeave it to me later ... If you stay here.

ID=460152013
If those two people get caught ... you will get ah.\nYou do not want to see such an appearance.

ID=460152014
Go.\nplease ....

ID=460152015
Oh, what for you?\nYou should be stretching your wings on vacation right?

ID=460152016
What's wrong?\nI am too busy to miss the fight?

ID=270000001
Oh, what's wrong?\nWrinkle wrinkles between the eyebrows. trouble?

ID=270000002
(I told Miriam about Zenith)

ID=270000003
Oh ....\nIt is an illegal merchant ....

ID=270000004
So, I wonder if I should become strong even if I make a law?\nOr do you want to confirm the content of punishment when involved in an illegal person?

ID=270000005
Tentatively ... In case of violation concerning soul weapons and gears,\nThe highest level of severe punishment is supposed to be given.

ID=270000006
... But no one knows its contents.\nIn other words, nobody has ever heard of it.

ID=270000007
Simply put, we can not crack down on all illegal people.\nTherefore, it is important to keep it in check with ambiguous words "severe punishment\

ID=270000008
There are a lot of people around me, too?\nBut I have never heard a story about being punished.

ID=270000009
... In a world like this, we must rethink from the definition of illegalities.\nThere are unavoidable things to survive ....

ID=270000010
Do you think you can blame those who protrude from the desk rules?\nMeans to survive ... Speaking of it.

ID=270000011
Did I become the answer?\nIn short, you should like it. And ....

ID=270000012
Whatever it is illegal, there is no problem if you do not get caught ....\nWrong? Giggle

ID=270000013
This is my opinion to the last.\nYou should also listen to solid Rie.

ID=670000001
Ryu might advise from another point of view.

ID=370000001
You should ask Ryu.\nI might also advise from another point of view.

ID=700000101
... Illegal merchant?

ID=700000102
There is not illegal good or bad.\nIt is to violate the law and to be punished.

ID=700000103
The law is a rule created to prevent accidents.\nTo raise the law increases the probability of accidents. It is subject to punishment.

ID=700000104
That's the question. In this world law works,\nDoes the accident seem to be prevented?

ID=700000105
The answer is obvious. There is no such thing as accident here.\nIn this world, compliance with the law may cause a crisis conversely.

ID=700000106
If accidents happen regardless of compliance with the law ....\nIt will not be necessary to dare to be bound.

ID=700000107
There may be opinions that this law should be kept because it is such a world.\nHowever, in order to observe the law, we will put our own life ....

ID=700000108
I support illegalities.\nTo survive in this world we need a flexible means.

ID=700000109
There is no question or reprimand about this matter.\nI decide. You do not have to listen to the opinions of others.

ID=700000110
It's over from me.\nLater you will think of yourself.

ID=570000001
Oh, I thought you would come again.\nIn such a time, I want to sneak up.

ID=470000001
Well, why do not you try!

ID=270000501
Basically only Seoul Weapons and Gears are on me.\nAs I mentioned before, the performance itself is different from the supply from the coalition.

ID=270000502
No, the dimensions are different, the dimension is. Hydrofuff ....

ID=270000503
Basically there are also skills of production.\nI guess the difference in materials is big.

ID=270000504
There is a material that only I can handle ....\nPerhaps you know strange things that give off fluffy and soft light?

ID=270000505
You seem to have it. The official name is "vacuum meter".\nBlank energy changed, special energies body ... Is it possible?

ID=270000506
Anyway, it is energy that only soul workers can materialize.\nOnly Seoul workers can obtain this. I call him "a soul".

ID=270000507
The soul has huge energy.\nAlthough handling is a bit difficult, if you use it, the performance will be much higher.

ID=270000508
After all, the crucial difference between me and the union is whether I can handle the soul ....\nTo put it another way, is it a bad instrument? Haha.

ID=270000509
Besides, the soul is hard to materialize in perfect condition.\nIt does not mean that anyone can get it.

ID=270000510
There is something that is weaker than the soul.\nMixing tea and raising density makes it a perfect soul.

ID=270000511
Well, materials for soul weapons and gears are not just the soul.\nI also need a base ore or core.

ID=270000512
The most important thing is "design drawing".\nI can appoint a hand, but I am not good at creating it.

ID=270000513
Well, the explanation is good around here?\nIt will be faster to see it actually ... and.

ID=270000514
Since you will not have any fish or soul yet,\nI will give out all of you with a bleeding large service. ... This time only.

ID=270000515
First of all it's a good deal ....\nIt is a material that makes "one squirrel" that I talked about a while ago, and a squirrel "a soul".

ID=670000501
Hold it and ask me to "produce".\nLet's make a "mixed soul".

ID=370000501
Okay, please ask me to produce with the materials I gave you.

ID=700005201
Well then ... Do you try making soul weapons with this soul?\nUm ... the design drawing is ... ....

ID=700005202
This is a design drawing. Though it is a thing at the time of challenging creation once.\nDesign drawing and ... with soul ... ... and others ... ....

ID=700005203
OK! Ready!\nOK, please ask me to make this material.

ID=700005204
The type of soul weapons used by you is ....\n"% Userweapon%" So let's make it accordingly.

ID=570000501
How? Is not it amazing?\nWhat? What?

ID=570000502
Ha ha ha ha ... well, that's not a big deal.\nIf you have a design drawing, you can create more amazing things.

ID=570000503
If you have something you want, come over.\nI will make anything if there is any material!

ID=570000504
Oh, of course it is free, is not it?\nDo I need to pay? You know what?

ID=570000505
Well then, see you again!\nTalking with a celebrity like you, it's a little masu ....

ID=570000506
Actually, I'm on the wanted list ... Ha ha ha.\nAnyway, if you need something, come on at any time!

ID=470000501
Well then in the end ... Welcome to the illegal world ~!\nThe dusk alchemist Zenith is waiting anytime! Hehe!

ID=260152501
Well ... I can give you a chance to talk to me in my free time,\nThis is not so far.

ID=260152502
... I can not say it in detail, but something strange happens in Grace City.\nFurther to anomalous blank .... Oh, my head is getting sore.

ID=260152503
It's an abnormal blank but ... it's kind of awkward. Actually ...

ID=260152504
No, after all it is OK.\nIt's not to talk to people on vacation.

ID=260152505
No, continue.

ID=260152506
... Commander.\nWould you like to go alone if it is a punishment bunch?

ID=260152507
Punishment talk ... Is not it really interesting?\nWhat kind of punishment will be carried out together? Fluff ... ... as if ....

ID=260152508
Yes it is.\nI will also put a knife in my throat?

ID=260152509
Hey!

ID=260152510
......

ID=260152511
Well, as it will be transmitted sooner or later ....\nThere is no problem if you know a little about it.

ID=260152512
The occurrence of abnormal white spaces is not the first time.\nOnce in the past, abnormal whites have occurred in the western part of Crow Dream.

ID=260152513
Unusual blank ... It does not have a negative impact on itself.\nThe problem is that the specific energy wavelength coming out of the abnormal space rises above the sky.

ID=260152514
If that energy accumulates and exceeds a certain number ....

ID=260152515
The sky opens.\nThere is a golden sky ....

ID=260152516
It is a phenomenon called "golden aura".\nThe whole sky is covered in gold, and the area spreads.

ID=260152517
In fact, I can not predict what will happen.\nThe last golden awakening ceased on the way ....

ID=260152518
To be exact, it was stopped by someone's hand ... would it?

ID=260152519
... I agree. I forgot.

ID=260152520
... Senior. You are not good at telling lies.

ID=260152521
......

ID=260152522
I wonder if I can talk about this situation.\nI can not say that this time it is the same as the abnormal blank at that time.

ID=260152523
If you investigate, it is quick to enter the inside though ....\nIt is impossible in this situation. I regret it but I have to leave it alone.

ID=260152524
(I'd like to go into an unusual blank)

ID=260152525
Are you serious?\nEven though I am on vacation ....

ID=660152501
Senia, you can not stop laughing?

ID=660152502
Is the nose hair of the commander too long?

ID=660152503
Well, if you would say "get into an abnormal space" ....\nIt certainly was thought. I will pretend to be the result.

ID=660152504
You will not die easily, and ...\nThen it is irresponsible and bad, but may I ask?

ID=660152505
I will allow you to enter anomalous space.\nPlease check what is going on inside.

ID=360152506
I will allow you to enter anomalous space.\nPlease check what is going on inside.

ID=601525201
Welcome back. ... How was it?

ID=601525202
Where the space fused ...?\nThere was also a Rapid Flame you fought before.

ID=601525203
......

ID=601525204
... Commander.

ID=601525205
Well, no doubt.\nIt is the same phenomenon as the sign of golden color.

ID=601525206
It seems better to tell them.\nAlthough I can draw attention to contacting traitors.

ID=601525207
But without his betrayal,\nWe would not have been here either.

ID=601525208
... That is right.\nBut after all, traitors can not forgive.

ID=601525209
Senior with a wide mind.\nIs your chest too tinge?

ID=601525210
... What did you say?

ID=601525211
Did I say something?

ID=601525212
... I will return the story.\nThat man ... is it still there?

ID=601525213
Well, I was saying that I liked the scenery.\nAs you know, I can not go out.

ID=601525214
It is terrible unbelievable.\nThe top is blank, the bottom is the devastated city ... What is good?

ID=601525215
Anyway, I do not know what will happen,\nIf you are looking for anomalous blanks, go to Ruin Fortress.

ID=601525216
Because there seems to be abnormal whitespace there too.

ID=601525217
Although it is on vacation it is hard.\nSince we still have things to do, see you again.

ID=560152501
......

ID=560152502
What's wrong?\nWorking without holidays Did you come to make fun of humans?

ID=460152501
... what?\nUnusual blank?

ID=260153001
Do you want to enter an abnormal white space?\nHow pretty ... ....

ID=260153002
It is a dangerous place with risky risks.\nIt's not like a place for children to enter with curiosity.

ID=260153003
If you are busy with your time, cooperate in exploring near soul workers.\nIt seems to be caught and not caught. I'm getting crazy.

ID=260153004
Hey, Martin.\nThat girls have left here already. Why was such a waste ...?

ID=260153005
Wrong! ! Absolutely not! !\nThat kids are here! Perhaps it's around ...!

ID=260153006
... I do not want to go to the next task.\nI can see time earnings.

ID=260153007
... It will definitely be the LXT related mission. I am sorry for such a troublesome job.\nYou ought to be great. I do not know what you do not need to impose on others.

ID=260153008
Ah ... no sound is coming out. A brilliant analysis.

ID=260153009
all right. I will let out as much as possible to enter an abnormal space.\nBut, why are you telling me?

ID=260153010
(I talked about "the signs of golden color" that Senia was saying)

ID=260153011
......

ID=260153012
Amanda.

ID=260153013
I do not even know. Dr. Sarah!

ID=260153014
... Hua ....

ID=260153015
In the past, that incident that the sky was covered with gold.\nThe situation is almost the same ... Are you planning to go into an abnormal space to check it?

ID=260153016
Is the sky golden ...?\nWill golden warriors come down too? Is it a laser weapon?

ID=260153017
... The details are unknown, but as you have heard.\nIt seems that the sky gets covered in gold and that area will expand steadily.

ID=260153018
Well ... but what's wrong with that?\nIt's nice to be covered in gold.

ID=260153019
Psychotic disappears.

ID=260153020
... Psychosis?

ID=260153021
People under that golden sky ... Everyone got a mental abnormality.\nNot a single person. I have never been officially announced ....

ID=260153022
There is no official announcement ... so why?

ID=260153023
... wait! Amanda chan!

ID=260153024
Dr. Sarah, how do you know?

ID=260153025
......

ID=260153026
... Because my husband was one of them.

ID=260153027
... eh.

ID=260153028
... Amanda.\nYou had better practice reading the air a little.

ID=260153029
I'm sorry.\nMe ... Also ....

ID=260153030
Do not worry.\nBecause it chewed after the sign of gold was over.

ID=260153031
......

ID=260153032
... Hey, Martin?\nYou also need to practice reading the air, are not you?

ID=260153033
If the current situation closely resembles that time ....\nI need to investigate.

ID=260153034
Ok ... let 's give permission to enter.\nAre you ready?

ID=660153001
I will tell you earlier. We also tried to enter anomalous blanks.\nHowever, the extraordinarily sturdy walls were occupied and I could not enter.

ID=660153002
I prepared all the tanks with a huge drill ....\nBefore the assault, the unmanned robot is being attacked. The point is that your power is necessary.

ID=660153003
That ... wait a moment.\nA tank with a huge drill? Did there like that for?

ID=660153004
Well, it's warm. It's a pioneering tank called a land bison.\nIt is not an unmanned aircraft ....

ID=660153005
... Martin, did you send a soldier to an unusual blank?

ID=660153006
No way. No matter how much I am, it is not that cruel.

ID=660153007
If it's not an unmanned aircraft, it would be that people were on board!

ID=660153008
I put AI and sent it.

ID=660153009
...?

ID=660153010
Did you say Jessie?\nIt's that AI with a bad face.

ID=660153011
If it is AI, there is no problem even if you put it into a dangerous area.\nEven if a land bison breaks, you will not lose your life.

ID=660153012
Do not you think that it is efficient operation?\nI think that it deserves praise.

ID=660153013
... AI.\nWas that so obedient?

ID=660153014
If you said that you should format it if you do not go, you will be glad to hear it.\nAfter all the mind is understood.

ID=660153015
As expected, it is an efficient operation.

ID=660153016
Let's receive it as a compliment

ID=660153017
This is about chat ....\nWell, thank you for your consideration.

ID=360153001
Allow entry into abnormal white space.\nYou should investigate as much as you like.

ID=601530201
How was it?\nIs it the same phenomenon as abnormal whitespace so far?

ID=601530202
......

ID=601530203
I see. It seems to be a problem.\nIs it almost certain that the Chunichi phenomenon called 'sign of golden' occurs?

ID=601530204
You should consider how to deal with it.\nDr. Sarah. What happened in the past? It did not fit naturally.

ID=601530205
... Anyone should know.\n7 years ago, that person who was in the Union ... ....

ID=601530206
......

ID=601530207
You mean him.\nThe strongest soul worker in history.

ID=601530208
Yes. He solved the signs of gold.\nIt is unknown how it was done.

ID=601530209
But, there is no man now.\nYou are dead.

ID=601530210
... Report it to the upper part.\nWe alone will not be able to draw any conclusions.

ID=601530211
This is just a matter of expectation ....\n%username% ... There is a high possibility that you can keep an eye out.

ID=601530212
It is terribly similar to the behavior of that man.\n... but it does not mean you are excellent.

ID=601530213
Anyway, enjoy enjoying the rest of your vacation.\nWhile being anxious by! Huhaha! !

ID=601530214
... sorry.\nI apologize instead.

ID=560153001
Huh, could you enjoy your trip?

ID=560153002
As you know, the sky is beginning to open.\nThe heavenly golden sky ....

ID=560153003
At that time, I care about the history approaching you.

ID=460153001
Please do not forget.\nThe day the sky is open ... not so far.

ID=460153002
By that time ....\nI will put my strength.

ID=460153003
Because the axis will return quickly.

ID=260153501
that? What happened?\nIs there any problem in the room? Is it water leakage? Blackout

ID=260153502
Oh, do you want to know how to vegetable garden?

ID=260153503
Hmm, I understand!\nThen, if you grab a knack, you will be able to teach you how to make a comfortable "home garden" comfortably!

ID=260153504
First of all, please plow the soil with a scoop so you can use the vegetable garden plant pot in my room!\nI am selling the scoop at the terminal of my room. Now you can buy it at a special price?

ID=260153505
Purchase it, plow the soil and ... ~ .... How! In earnest "cultivation" system will be available!

ID=260153506
"Cultivation" system, "species" purchased from the terminal of my room\nIt is a system that we can plant and plant in flowerpots! Hehe.

ID=260153507
Moreover! Unlike ordinary cultivation, there is no need to control especially after planting seeds!

ID=260153508
When planting, when I woke up as I went to sleep ... Jahn! Completion!\nIndeed, "Greetings sleeping and waiting" is ♪

ID=260153509
What is the reason to grow soon? ... Somehow the squirrel function is attached to the flowerpot ... or something.\nI do not know well! Tehe ♪

ID=260153510
And anyway, we can cultivate in a short time!\nfurther! Depending on the kind of planting species, you can cultivate fruits and flowers!

ID=260153511
But you only need to harvest by yourself.\nIf you leave it for a long time, the flowerpot will nutrition too much for the crop and it will rot.

ID=260153512
I'd like you to do the harvesting automatically, whatever ....\nIs not that the world not so sweet?

ID=260153513
Therefore, please do harvest before decaying!

ID=260153514
It is hard to understand just by explaining.

ID=260153515
At first glance it is like a hundred pictures! We prepared a trial version so that you can actually experience it!\nPlease bring this "seed of tomato" to "tomato" by using cultivation system.

ID=260153516
Wilted or rotten things are useless. Please bring a proper tomato.\nIs that okay?

ID=660153501
"Processing" will teach you if you bring tomatoes.\nWell then, please go ahead!

ID=360153501
Is there anything you asked yet? What?\nThere is still teaching, so please hurry!

ID=601535201
Oh, thanks for your hard work!\nThen please show me what I was asking for.

ID=601535202
(Showing "Tomato" harvested in Ryoko)

ID=601535203
Well, it is truly. Please grow like this in the future.\nEasy, right? Giggle

ID=601535204
Then, the one that remains is one. I will explain "processing"!

ID=601535205
"Processing" refers to the act of processing crops with ease by using "My room terminal machine" and "Concentrator".\nPlants like flowers and herbs are processed into "candy" and fruit and vegetables like grapes and tomatoes are processed into "juice".

ID=601535206
Then, the theory is also understood, let's go to practice!

ID=601535207
Since I will give you a "concentrator" used for processing this time,\nPlease make "Tomato 50% Juice" using "Tomato".

ID=560153501
Thank you for your hard work!

ID=560153502
(I handed "Tomato 50% Juice" processed to Ryoko)

ID=560153503
Oh! You can do it properly! Processed products are made by using organic raw materials\nIt is also good for your body and has special effects so please make use of it.

ID=560153504
If you want to make something more delicious than the juice you brought now\nPlease purchase 'additives' and put it in processing. Easy, right?

ID=560153505
Well, this is the end of the vegetable lesson.\nHow was it? It's easy?

ID=560153506
Giggle So please continue to enjoy vegetable garden life!

ID=560153507
Oh, that's right! After this time,%username% 's "My room terminal machine"\nI will keep the vegetable management system on, so please use "My room terminal machine" when you do vegetable garden!

ID=560153508
Perks may be paid depending on harvest volume?\nLet 's do our best!

ID=460153501
Giggle Now, the explanation of vegetable garden is over!

ID=460153502
Please enjoy vegetable garden life!\nsee you! %username%!

ID=220002501
Welcome to the "My room system" policy to secure personal living space!

ID=220002502
With the currently operating "vegetable management system\\nWhen accessing the terminal after harvest, we have paid compensation according to the number of harvests.

ID=220002503
This is a part of activities to popularize 'vegetable garden' and to return the crowdream nature to the former blank.

ID=220002504
Do you plan to use the system and plan to harvest crops?

ID=620002501
Thank you for your participation.

ID=320002501
Welcome to my room system "My room system" for securing private housing space!\nFollow "vegetable management system" and check the number of crops you harvest.

ID=320002502
We have canceled the renewal because we have not achieved planned yield.\nYou can renew when you reach the harvest volume.

ID=520002501
Welcome to my room system "My room system" for securing private housing space!\nFollow "vegetable management system" and check the number of crops you harvest.

ID=520002502
I confirmed that it meets the yield.

ID=420002501
Thank you for your participation.

ID=220003001
Hmm? Is there still something else?

ID=220003002
Hmm ... "I want to get inside an abnormal blank"?

ID=220003003
There is no reason to stop you, as I know that there is nothing to be a threat to you.\nAlright, allow abnormal white space.

ID=220003004
But do not be discouraged.\nAlthough there is no threat, it does not change to dangerous things.

ID=220003005
Also, do not forget to report if you go.

ID=620003001
Take care and go.

ID=320003001
Although there is no threat, carelessness is prohibited.\nDo not mind.

ID=520003001
You seem to have returned.\nHave there been changes in the internal situation?

ID=420003001
It was almost the same as when I first entered ... / /.\nWell, it was a pain. You should take a good rest.

ID=220003501
... What's wrong? A lost article?

ID=220003502
Huh? You want to get over there again? Are you serious?

ID=220003503
Well, it might be better than nothing.\nOK. I will allow you to get in and out of extraordinary space.

ID=220003504
Instead, you only have to report firmly.

ID=620003501
Do not overdo it.

ID=320003501
You may be distracted if you are moving rather than doing nothing.\nBe careful. Report it when you return.

ID=520003501
Welcome back.

ID=420003501
Alright and better than anything.\nDo you feel sorry? Then you have to take a good rest.

ID=220004001
What is new.\nStill have something for you?

ID=220004002
... Do you want to enter anomalous blank again?

ID=220004003
Well, it's okay, is not it? Because you are going to investigate on vacation,\nThere is no reason to oppose this.

ID=220004004
I will give you permission. Please go.\nDo not forget to report.

ID=320004001
I do not mean to stop it. Instead, please only report.\nThen be careful and go.

ID=520004001
Have you returned yet? As expected.

ID=420004001
It was a pain.\nThen slowly enjoy the vacation.

ID=220004501
What a look, it looks like I'm missing in the blank.\nIs it for something?

ID=220004502
... Although I told you in a joke, it is said that you are right.

ID=220004503
Well, I will not stop if I want to go.\nI want to return on vacation and work. There is no reason to stop.

ID=620004501
In order to appeal that you are working properly, please make a firm report.

ID=320004501
Also, I'd like to enter blanks, soul workers love blanks. Ha ha ha!\nThe person himself wants so. I will not stop it, but I will only ask for the report.

ID=520004501
Have you already returned? Is the speed increasing day by day?

ID=420004501
Well done. The report is over and you should spend it like a scrapped person.\nEnvy you to go quickly.

ID=260154001
It seems time has come.

ID=260154002
The twisted space that humans call "abnormal blank"\nIt is a collection of residual thoughts of the world that opened the book and mixed up.

ID=260154003
Because it is residual energy, there is no axis, and I will take a picture of the enormous history of the surroundings.\nYou too know well. Anomalous blanks Those who interacted with each other inside.

ID=260154004
However, the four abnormal whites you have come through are only part of the residual energy.\nMost of the energy is gathered in the sky and it will be complete soon.

ID=260154005
It will be a source of coverage covering the past, sky projected this time with gold color.\nIt is a phenomenon that you call "a sign of golden color".

ID=260154006
The enormous power born by the collision of the mighty two existence got stained in gold and created irregular.\nThe two things that do not mix together were mixed, creating new things.

ID=260154007
I call them "equilibrium".

ID=260154008
I do not know the purpose of "equilibrium".\nSuch existence has not been recorded on the history so far, it has disappeared before becoming history.

ID=260154009
However, there is one sure thing.\n"Equilibrium" has more power than everything that existed in this star.\nSo, residual energy will copy them.

ID=260154010
And it is already in the completion stage.

ID=260154011
Soon the sky will be covered in gold and its dazzling light will swallow people's consciousness and rob the reason.\nOnly you can stop it.

ID=260154012
And if you have the power to overcome them ....\nIt means that you are ready to shine on the coming big stage.

ID=260154013
"Equilibrium" is what happened once in the past.\nIt was struck off by the power of man.

ID=260154014
Please find your companion who experienced it.\nI will lead you.

ID=660154001
Well, I am looking forward to it.

ID=360154001
Please find your companion who experienced "equilibrium".\nI will lead you.

ID=601540101
I came, a newcomer.\nI received a report from Amanda.

ID=601540102
After all it seems that similar abnormal blank phenomenon is occurring also in Ruin Fortress.

ID=601540103
... It may be happening.

ID=601540104
Well, it will not be wrong.

ID=601540105
noob. I have talked to you once before but I will say it again.\nThere is something that has happened in the past in this series of phenomena now.

ID=601540106
Anomalous blanks occurred here and thereafter, the sky became golden.

ID=601540107
All the existence under that golden sky began to go crazy.\nThe ingredients changed in ingredients, and the mind began to break the spirit.

ID=601540108
It can not afford to leave this Union,\nI dispatched specially constructed members to the golden sky.

ID=601540109
... with the "Tenebris" called Cow Dream's strongest soul worker in the forefront.

ID=601540110
In conclusion, thanks to them the signs of gold fell.\nOnly a small number of people know what is inside and what kind of fighting has existed.

ID=601540111
It was an incident involving direct intervention of "order of road" supervising the coalition headquarters.\nThere is no room for entering the end like us.

ID=601540112
......

ID=601540113
The order came directly from that order of load.\n%username%. Let me end signs of golden color.

ID=601540114
Do you know what kind of evaluation you are receiving within the coalition now?\nThe second coming of Tenebris and the next road candidate.

ID=601540115
It's not a bad thing. It is not easy to combine the ability and surrounding trust.

ID=601540116
If you keep on walking your way like you do now, you will have "power" in your office.\nIt is not the power of a simple body and mind, it is the true power surviving the world.

ID=601540117
Power is what calls for strength.\nIf you have enough power, other powerful existence will come to yours.

ID=601540118
Whether you see them as "fellows" or "enemies" depends on you.\nThe sure thing is that you must choose either one.

ID=601540119
That time will certainly come.\nTo the extent that you have the power.

ID=601540120
Fuu ....\n... It got longer.

ID=601540121
Anyway, the general headquarters is paying attention.\nI got a sign of gold, I'm cleaning up trying to show off.

ID=601540122
Please head towards "the 6th area."\nMeet Bucker there.

ID=601540123
What's wrong? So surprising?\nWell, maybe it is surprising if the name of that man comes up suddenly.

ID=601540124
The sign of gold will occur over the sixth area.\nYou can not go by the usual way, please follow the guide. Because the circumstances are explained.

ID=601540125
Then be careful.\nI am waiting for a good report.

ID=560154001
I was waiting ~ ~.

ID=460154001
Long time no see ~ ~.\nIs your body okay?

ID=260154501
I heard the story from Senia - san?\nWas it a sign of golden ...? That may occur again so please prepare ~ ~.

ID=260154502
Even so, I felt something strange in the recent sky.\nWell, I prepared for moving means ~. Do not worry about equipment or crews ~.

ID=260154503
No, it is abnormal.

ID=260154504
What is wrong?

ID=260154505
We can not direct Skycraft to such dangerous places.\nIt is merely a suicidal act, such as heading to a place without any information.

ID=260154506
Nonone. There is no problem at all.\nWe just have to send soul workers there.

ID=260154507
can not believe. Is there a guarantee that the problem will not occur?

ID=260154508
Hmm ... I can not help it.\nBilly!

ID=260154509
Yes, the captain.

ID=260154510
I will ask later.

ID=260154511
OK.

ID=260154512
Do not do it, please do not run away.\nIt is to involve life. Do not think that it can be convinced by unfounded explanation ... ....

ID=260154513
Azine is cute.

ID=260154514
A What? And suddenly what ... ... that, I will not ride that hand!\nI still want to die ...!

ID=260154515
What is Beppin 's a guy?\nMy voice is also great.

ID=260154516
Ba, Baba, do not say stupid things, explain quickly ...! !

ID=260154517
What is wrong with a cute one? Oh?

ID=260154518
Wow, I am not bad ... but ...!\nAnd anyway it is useless! It is wasteful if you try to mislead me! Absolutely until that ...!

ID=260154519
Because it's only a bit. What? (Yui)

ID=260154520
Here, hey! ! Do not come so close ...!

ID=260154521
Do not say things like cute though.\nIs not it ...? What? (Suzui)

ID=260154522
Hi! Well, I still have such a mind ready ...!\nThen, at least take a gas mask ...!

ID=260154523
Because it's only once?\nWhat? (Suzuzui)

ID=260154524
Well, okay! !\nSo please stay away! !

ID=260154525
Captain.\nOK.

ID=260154526
Good job.\nIt is as usual weak to push ~. Please visit a nice man.

ID=260154527
......

ID=260154528
(......)

ID=260154529
So, are you going to get out soon?

ID=660154501
As I will tell you earlier, no one can predict what will happen over there.\nAs far as I can see, I can see something like a castle ... I do not know the details ~.

ID=660154502
Anyway, I can only show you the entrance ~.\nIt is impossible any more.

ID=660154503
Well, let 's start departing ~.\nPlease when you are ready, please tell Azin.

ID=360154501
When preparation is completed, please tell Azin.

ID=601545101
Well, I guess I managed to arrive.

ID=560154501
Me is also the first time to come ....\nIt is spectacular ~.

ID=460154501
By the way, is this genuine gold?

ID=260155001
I do not know if ordinary people like us can enter foot in this place.\nTake care. As soon as I thought it was dangerous to break away ~.

ID=260155002
Ah, that is it ~. It is something I heard from Sennia, but please listen carefully ~.\nI thought that it was reliable information as I was told that it was purchased at the fugue preparedness.

ID=260155003
Well then, "A sign of gold occurs in the sky over the sixth area and the codename is" Golden Citadel ".\nSupplementing numerous vacuum irregularities inside the Golden Citadel "

ID=260155004
"Among them, four individuals with large amounts of energy are confirmed.The hosts against the human beings are strong, it is selected as a subject to be subjugated.\nGolden Citadel's hidden entrance opens when all four individuals are subjugated "

ID=260155005
"When entering, confirm one individual who overwhelms the existing four energies, and has a strong hostile towards humans.\nSelection as a target for subjugation "

ID=260155006
"When the last individual is subjugated, signs of gold color end phenomenon"

ID=260155007
... and, it seems like that. In other words, if you defeat the four strongest inside,\nRasubosu is coming out ~ is not it ~.

ID=260155008
So, if you defeat Rasubosu, the sign of gold color will end.

ID=260155009
Is it OK?

ID=660155001
Okay, please work hard.\nBecause Mee waits here ~.

ID=660155002
Do not you think you should take Me as well inside?\nIs not that okay?

ID=660155003
As I mentioned earlier, we will evacuate immediately if it is late or there is an incident.\nSo please be careful not to be too late ~.

ID=660155004
Well, take care.\nOkay, is this the radio wave range here ... um ....

ID=360155001
As I mentioned earlier, we will evacuate immediately if it is late or there is an incident.\nSo please be careful not to be too late ~.

ID=560155001
Did you finish?\nFaster than I thought ... Oh? What happened?

ID=560155002
It looks like I saw something I should not look ....\nWhat happened inside?

ID=560155003
Gold color A woman who saw then?\nHello? Let 's talk to me without talking alone alone.

ID=560155004
... But when I think carefully, there is no point in the place where Me knew.

ID=460155001
Well ... thank you for such a thing ~!\nPlease take a moment. I have a terrible face.

ID=220005001
%username%, just right. I was looking for it.

ID=220005002
Do you know that we are taking planned broadcasts? Actually, I'm thinking about making an intro to use on that broadcast.

ID=220005003
There is an opinion saying how to take a scene where you are fighting Seoul Junk.

ID=220005004
Sorry, can you cooperate?\nYou may ask another guy ... if you can, I'd like to ask you.

ID=620005001
Was saved! Thanks for taking a breath.

ID=620005002
Well then, can we ask for it soon?\nThe shooting location is towards the coastal road. So, please advance the battle there.

ID=620005003
You do not have to worry about this.\nHire a mercenary called Ralph. I decided to escort him.

ID=620005004
Well then, I asked.

ID=320005001
Hmm? Have not you gone yet?\nHurry up because the staff is heading now.

ID=520005001
You seem to have returned.\nThe shooting staff seems to have arrived.

ID=520005002
I tried watching the video ... but it was not bad.

ID=520005003
Was saved.\nThanks to shooting the shoot went well.

ID=420005001
If you want to take another picture again, come any time. Because I will take as much as I can.

ID=220005501
Haa ... the stench does not disappear.

ID=220005502
Um,%username%.\nI'm sorry, could you please ask me a favor?

ID=620005501
%username%! Thank you!\nThere is still a stench in the underground waterway. Soul junk is supposed to be left.

ID=620005502
Until now, there was room for stockpiling amount of water supply tank so it managed somehow, but something will happen as it is.\nSorry to trouble you, please defeat Seoul Junk of the underground waterway!

ID=320005501
I am busy but I'm sorry. I'd like a Seoul junk in the underground waterway.

ID=520005501
%username%!\nDid you handle Soul Junk?

ID=420005501
Thank you! Hahaha ... I'm sorry just to rely on you.

ID=420005502
However,%username% and the people of the Star Forest Association also cooperated and repeatedly asked for the suppression of Seoul Junk, but there is no indication that it will decrease all the way.

ID=420005503
... Is there something in the basement? Is something creating a soul junk ...?\nIt is a joke! Ha ha! If such a thing really existed ... Please manage somehow ...!

ID=220006001
Ah! %username%! Just right!\nThere was something I wanted to ask.

ID=220006002
I may have heard it, but I decided to move again.\nIt seems that there are not places suitable for me, but it seems there is a pavilion which I went through with this previous interview?

ID=220006003
It is hard to go back to Grace City, and I do not care about spending at such a house.\nSo, I bought that pavilion. But you still have spiders?

ID=220006004
I do not want to see it like the previous one, so you have to get rid of spiders a bit.

ID=620006001
Well then, thank you.

ID=320006001
Ah! Also, clean up thoroughly! nice to meet you!

ID=520006001
You got it back. Was the spider cleaning going well?

ID=420006001
Fuu, it's saved ... Fufu! I will lend you this time!

ID=420006002
Well then, I will call you again when I can use it so stay close!

ID=420006003
See ya!

ID=220006501
I have been waiting for you.

ID=220006502
I thank you from the bottom of my heart that I always lend you my strength. But ....

ID=220006503
A little problem occurred.\nSeveral pieces of laboratory soul junks that had been stored in the collapsed laboratory were about to leak outside.

ID=220006504
Fortunately mercenaries caught it and handled it safely ....\nIt would be nice if there was only one clearance to go out to the outside, but if it was not the case, the same thing could happen again.

ID=220006505
So please.\nPlease enter the laboratory and process the remaining soul junk.

ID=620006501
Since this case will be carried out secretly, please treat it as unnoticeable as possible.\nSo, we are waiting for you.

ID=320006501
There must be no such thing as Seoul Junk comes out again. Please hurry as much as possible.

ID=520006501
Welcome back.\nDid you manage Soul Junk?

ID=420006501
Thank you very much.\nWe will do something later.

ID=420006502
There may be times when you can borrow your strength. At that time I would appreciate your favor.

ID=220007001
Yo.\nThere was something I just asked for. A little time is good?

ID=220007002
There are guys who fly around in Seoul junk, do not they?\nRecently I have burned them.

ID=220007003
Even those who are on the ground are having trouble,\nThe damage from the attack from the air is serious. There are already many people sent to the hospital.

ID=220007004
So, I'd like to ask you to handle them. How is it? Can you lend me a hand?

ID=620007001
Sorry. Think of it as it is.\nThey seem to appear frequently around the shelter. Go over there.

ID=320007001
It's a story that often appears around the shelter. Why do not you go over there?

ID=520007001
Good job. I guess you can relax a little with this.

ID=420007001
Even so, the bastard of Seoul Junk, there is no sign of disappearing at all. I'm getting bored.

ID=420007002
Well, but even thanks to them I am able to live. It's kind of sticky to hold on.

ID=420007003
Anyway thank you.\nSee you again.

ID=220007501
noob!\nPerhaps you also join the next strategy?

ID=220007502
Oh! Just right!\nThere is something I want you to help me a bit.

ID=220007503
I am in trouble because the delivery of goods to the next operational area is delayed.

ID=220007504
There is a way to make it in time for somehow, but ... I need your power.

ID=220007505
Oh, that's not difficult!\nHowever, it is only necessary to let us pass the elevated road occupied by Vesi. Easy, right?

ID=220007506
what happened? Are you bad? Are you bad?

ID=620007501
Truly new! Well then, thanks!

ID=320007501
that? Have not you gone yet?

ID=520007501
Welcome back! How? I did well?

ID=420007501
Really, I'm going to do a nice job!

ID=420007502
Please again!

ID=220008001
I was waiting. Your dependence has been asked.

ID=220008002
It seems that Vesi, which appeared in the incident of the Ned Company this time, is still showing up.

ID=220008003
I'd like to ask your experts to annihilate them again. Can you do it?

ID=620008001
Mum, that's it. A witch of the green wind ... was it? That Bon Cubbon ... Gohon!

ID=620008002
If that witch participates in battle ... to capture it as intact as possible and to be a prisoner of war!\nThis is a top priority! Various things to him ... Because I have something to ask! Okay!

ID=620008003
That's not it! Absolutely not! Do you understand?

ID=320008001
Separately there is no other intention ... no, there is not! Okay! I'm begging you!

ID=520008001
Did you go back?\nSo, what is the witch of the green wind?

ID=420008001
what! What? Do not you think?\nCertainly it should have seen with this eye. The figure, form, dress ... that all.

ID=420008002
Fuu ... I need to check it again. Anyway, I had a hard time.

ID=420008003
Next will escape ... Poison! !

ID=420008004
(... cease to catch it)

ID=220008501
Yogo ~, new entry ~.

ID=220008502
You already understood your name, have not you? My greatness is ~.\nAfter that we just prepare evidence materials to prove the power of the F - ARIA missile and submit it to the conference.

ID=220008503
That's why, please lend me a hand.\nI want you to check how weak the Carla who received the F - ARIA missile is.

ID=620008501
Well then, be careful ~.

ID=320008501
Take care.

ID=520008501
Welcome back ~. The materials gathered ~?

ID=420008501
Thank you ~. I will only organize this after ~.

ID=420008502
Thank you for your hard work ~ new entrance ~.\nI will call you if there is something again ~.

ID=220009001
Oh, hello there!

ID=220009002
A few men were brought to the hospital, but I heard that Vesi appeared again in Dave Town!

ID=220009003
It is said that members who are still on site still struggle with defensive lines,\nThe defensive line will be broken through as it is. Please! Please help them!

ID=620009001
Thank you! Please hurry!

ID=320009001
Oh, you still have to come. I think that it would be better to hurry!

ID=520009001
Is cheers for good work! How was the Vesi?

ID=420009001
Thank you very much!

ID=420009002
It is quite persistent.\nAs long as you see that it appears many times ... Is there something in Dave Town?

ID=420009003
Either way it is uneasy. The other members are still there ....\nPlease give me the power if you have something again%username%! Thank you!

ID=220009501
I came.

ID=220009502
A mission I wanted to fulfill by yourself suddenly occurred.

ID=220009503
Because it seems that the assassination unit that that phantom was conducting is going to resurrect.\nThe phantom aide is the center.

ID=220009504
Therefore, I want you to punish those aides.\nThere is a possibility that serious damage will occur if it is as it is.

ID=620009501
no time.\nThe troops of the assassination unit are still not gathered enough. If you hit it now.

ID=320009501
The assassination unit decides the game before it starts to move.

ID=520009501
Dancing shadow fellows were leading assassination units?

ID=420009501
Hmm ... According to the information I heard that there are many "dancing shadows".

ID=420009502
That is unlikely to be solved so easily.

ID=420009503
It was a pain.\nI will call you if there is something again.

ID=220010001
I was waiting for.

ID=220010002
I guess I'm supposed to be in such a situation.\nI thought that the human beings of Ned Company are greedy, but they still remain the same people ....

ID=220010003
There is no way to betray a human being.\nEven till battle with us ... it is painful.

ID=220010004
Can I ask you a favor?\nI want you to stop the person at the secret base of the Ned Company. Do not sin any more.

ID=620010001
Sorry ... And thank you.\nI do not think you will leave such a thing to young people like you.

ID=320010001
I'm begging you.

ID=520010001
It was a hard time.

ID=420010001
It was hard work.\nWas saved. You should take a good rest.

ID=220010501
Yahoo Death,%username%.

ID=220010502
There is something I'd like to ask%username% to do, Mass.

ID=220010503
Currently, the security robot located in the central control room refuses to control Watashi, despite the disappearance of Lucy, the main AI, there is a risk of damaging other people.

ID=220010504
Please destroy the security robot by%username%.

ID=620010501
Thank you. %username%.

ID=320010501
Wash your legs and wait for a mascara! %username%!

ID=520010501
%username%.\nI confirmed the robot Destroy in the central control room.

ID=420010501
Thank you trout!\nAll robots not obeying my order are destroy days!

ID=420010502
With this I get Ruin Fortress ....

ID=420010503
Happy ...! Well, I decided not to listen to it now.

ID=420010504
See you again ...%username%.

ID=220011001
I was waiting.

ID=220011002
It seems that something has happened to the previously secured core.

ID=220011003
The power distribution of the core does not match the recorded value at all.

ID=220011004
It seems that there is an electric leak somewhere ... I wonder if you will confirm a little.

ID=620011001
Well then can you check if there is any abnormality around the core?

ID=320011001
Well ... No way is someone stealing? I can not do that.

ID=520011001
Welcome back.\nHow was it?

ID=420011001
After all it was because of the robot.\nI was telling the crew members to prevent robot invasion, but it seems there was a gap somewhere.

ID=420011002
I'll tell you to check again for any other gaps.

ID=420011003
Thank you for this time. See you.

ID=220011501
Hey, Capability. A bit better?

ID=220011502
Ah ... well, I have a little wish in fact ....

ID=220011503
Oh my platoon was supposed to be in charge of the exploration task in the underground area, but according to the information is it quite extensive?

ID=220011504
So, I'm thinking of using the means of transport in the underground area, will you handle the robot that will roam nearby?

ID=620011501
Thank you! I count on you! Capability person!

ID=320011501
There is only you who can listen to my request. I'm begging you!

ID=520011501
Oh, the proficient!\nIs the robot managed?

ID=420011501
Was saved. my mother!\nWell then I guess I should report it to everyone. See you!

ID=420011502
(I am worried if I can go on a shuttle at that speed and do a profound exploration)

ID=220012001
Good job.

ID=220012002
The guys of the Ned Company ... It is really sneaky.\nI have been preparing for the war with the Star Forest Alliance for many years.

ID=220012003
To the forbidden weapons ... until such a brutal robot.\nThough it is already thrown away, it is not a good idea to leave it alone.

ID=220012004
It is a personal request, but I would like you to destroy the death raptor of the arsenal.

ID=620012001
Thank you. To be honest, the inside of the Star Forest Alliance is not clean as well.\nIf you leave me alone, I will definitely pass over someone else's hands.

ID=620012002
Well then, please.

ID=320012001
You should destroy that weapon without leaving it.\nEspecially, it is absolutely necessary to destroy only Death Raptor.

ID=520012001
Destructor could be destroyed?

ID=420012001
Good job.\nI wish it would be over with this ... is not it wide here? There are still a lot of things to do.

ID=420012002
I will call you if I find something again.

ID=420012003
I will see you around!

ID=220012501
%username%! R u free now? Do you have a favor to ask!

ID=220012502
Oh, because I do not want to interview them separately? Actually, I am planning to install a communication repeater in the direction of the deep core now,\nRobots are obstructing you, do not you? The elevator also stops well ... I am in a situation where the work does not remain.

ID=220012503
Therefore, I want you to organize a little around the elevator. How? It seems possible?

ID=620012501
Okay, good luck!

ID=320012501
I want you to hurry as soon as possible! There is an article that I have to finish by today's evening!

ID=520012501
welcome home! Is the elevator already alright?

ID=420012501
Thanks!\nIf I understand it, I will start working as soon as possible!

ID=420012502
Well then, see you later!

ID=220013001
Oh, are you in duty now?

ID=220013002
Actually there is something I'd like to ask another one,\nIs it OK?

ID=220013003
Robots developed by Ned Company at ST laboratories will be studied now.

ID=220013004
Probably ... I will mobilize researchers and I will come to gather materials as soon as possible.\nSo, before that you will be saved if you handle the robot. How? Can I?

ID=620013001
Well then, can we leave now?\nI also instruct researchers to prepare for the collection of materials.

ID=320013001
We will leave after you leave. So please hurry.

ID=520013001
Good job.

ID=520013002
It seems that researchers have finished collecting materials safely.

ID=420013001
It takes time to investigate the materials yet ... There may be materials that we can not use.\nThere is nothing better to have prepared. Please again.

ID=420013002
Then let 's take a good rest today.

ID=220013501
Wow, can you ask a moment?

ID=220013502
Actually, I am looking for a protocol that can identify the person who ordered the robot's black box and ordered it.

ID=220013503
... I know what is not easy. However, I think that human beings certainly make some kind of mistake somewhere.\nHumans are not robots. There must be traces of somewhere.

ID=220013504
However, I think that I understand, but I'm the only one It is hard to investigate all of the robots here.\nSo, I want the robot not to move so that I can easily investigate.

ID=620013501
Sorry.

ID=320013501
There is no power ... I can not do it.\nI can not defend what I should protect ....

ID=520013501
I came.\nI am sorry for all my hard work. I did not find any clue here either.

ID=420013501
I can not abandon this as it is. Their robots are still full.

ID=420013502
Also contact me if I know something. See you.

ID=260155501
... The world is gradually changing.\nBy her ... ... and he is going to the next stage little by little this world.

ID=260155502
Is the step correct?\nPlease close your eyes. Somewhat dangerous ... let me show you as well.

ID=260155503
(I did as I did)

ID=260155504
(Close your eyes, and from the far ruins you can hear a heterogeneous beat and a dull rupture.\nSuddenly the sound has never heard, changed to a horrible sound)

ID=260155505
(I felt that something huge was awake in the interior, with the unpleasant feeling intact.\nIt was getting closer to here, slowly holding intense malice.)

ID=260155506
(It seemed to be swallowed by an eerie force and opened her eyes hastily, Io was staring at him)

ID=260155507
Did you see it?

ID=260155508
Her intervention gave birth to such a result.

ID=260155509
Although it was a bitterly choice ... It is a bad future for this world.\nI do not know that the distortion will stay, while becoming larger ....

ID=260155510
In the place I saw earlier, "that" that I was wandering in that darkness is about to appear.\nNo ... I will show up soon.

ID=260155511
......

ID=260155512
You already know.\nThat "that" is such a powerful existence that you can not compete with your power.\nDimensions are different from enemies I have met.

ID=260155513
Even that Zion ....

ID=260155514
However, I can not escape from this fate.\nIn order to protect this world, you have to fight ....

ID=260155515
As for me, I hope that you will not fight.\nAlready many future and past history have changed,\nBecause you want to keep a lot of history in the future.

ID=260155516
But it will not come true.\nFighting is the mission and destiny of the soul bound with you like you ... and the fence of the sad gear.

ID=260155517
I ask you once again the last time.

ID=260155518
Are you really going to fight 'that'?

ID=660155501
......

ID=660155502
I understand.

ID=660155503
But ... you can not compete with you now.\nIn order to compete even a little, we need to weaken the power of "that".

ID=660155504
A blank crack should occur in the sixth area due to world distortion before "that" appears.

ID=660155505
It destroys all the blank cracks.\nWhat "that" appears is already a determined future,\nIf you destroy a blank crack, you can weaken the power of "that" even though it is trace.

ID=660155506
However, it is not easy to destroy cracks.\nBecause there should be many soul junks attracted by the power of "that" near the cracks.

ID=660155507
Well ... something's OK.

ID=360155501
I pray for your safety from my heart.

ID=601555201
It was good ... you were okay.

ID=601555202
At the end of your power and effort, the power of that is weakening considerably.\nNow, it may be possible to seal it.

ID=601555203
However, I'm not prohibited.\nOnce, even the first soul worker "Road" can not beat it, it was not able to be sealed.

ID=601555204
Sorry, even if you are you, you can not completely erase that.\nThat is an unchangeable truth ....

ID=601555205
However, if it is weakened now, that one, you should be able to seal it again.

ID=601555206
Please ... Please protect this world, and come back safely.

ID=601555401
It was returned.

ID=601555402
I also confirmed.\nA figure that "that" will go back into the darkness ....

ID=601555403
As expected, her choice ... ...\nI am feeling unwilling to be able to exchange words again like this.

ID=601555404
But, do not worry.

ID=601555405
The distortion of the world has become so big that it can not be stopped anymore.\nIf "that" can not be completely eliminated, I will regain power and appear again in this world.

ID=601555406
Besides ... it does not mean that "that" does not grow.

ID=601555407
"That" ... I'm sorry. You seem to have spoken a little bit.\nThat's where I can tell you.

ID=601555408
... The world began to distort.\nWhether you desire it or not, a mighty enemy appears one after another.\nYou will have to become strong as well.\nEven for not being caught up in the axis of the world.

ID=601555409
So, I am around here. Everyone is looking for you.

ID=601555410
Let's meet again.

ID=560155501
noob! What do you mean! What?

ID=560155502
Since an abnormal phenomenon occurred in the sixth area, if you contact Ruin Fortress, you do not have ....

ID=560155503
You ... what on earth were you doing?

ID=560155504
(I explained all about Sennia)

ID=560155505
Huh ...?

ID=560155506
Wait a moment, please! That means ... you\nDid you suppress the codename [The Thing]?

ID=560155507
Do a joke a little too.\nThat one, it is a monster who has barely stopped the other ten years ago already?

ID=560155508
No, it seems like that ... it's not hard!\nThat monster woke up! What? Besides, ... maybe it may appear ....

ID=560155509
Fuu ....\nBecause information comes in at a stretch, the organization of my head can not keep up.

ID=560155510
First of all, we have to do it from the situation arrangement.

ID=460155501
First of all, cheers for good work. I'd like to say ... but I will not know if this is your next reason?\nI understood?

ID=460155502
I thought that the seriousness of things was good and I was able to do about the report?\nIf you told me, I could cooperate with you! What? Completely ....

ID=460155503
... Huh.

ID=460155504
Well, thanks to you, there were no victims, and abnormal phenomena also fell.\nBut there is also a fear of re-doing, do not you think? Then I have to prepare this one.

ID=460155505
noob. You already know that.\nWith our power and force, that thing will not be attached to that one.

ID=460155506
It is a barrier that was loaded long ago and I just try not to move to other places.

ID=460155507
It is already a barrier for more than ten years ago, and it seems not to be long for ....

ID=460155508
After all, there seems to be no choice but to ask you.

ID=460155509
I will search for a substitute for that barrier and stop it until then.\nI stopped once, can I get next?

ID=460155510
I'll put in the sixth area a military person to monitor.\nPlease contact me as soon as an abnormal phenomenon such as this time occurs. Good?

ID=460155511
Well then, please take a rest. I'll call you from here.

ID=460155512
Oh, at the end, I will just say this.\nIf you imitate yourself next time ... you can not just do it?

ID=260156001
Well ....

ID=260156002
It is somewhat strange.\nAs with recent expansion of extraordinary space size,\nSoul junk and movements of Vesi ....

ID=260156003
Those who attacked five times a day,\nI have not got anything for the last few days.

ID=260156004
Rapid Flame is a battle group ....\nThat battle crazy ... I can not be grown quietly.

ID=260156005
There are two possibilities.

ID=260156006
Did enemies of interest appear more than us ...?

ID=260156007
Or she evacuated expecting something to happen.\nSo, do investigate the cause soon ....

ID=260156008
......

ID=260156009
The commander, I'm listening! What?

ID=260156010
I'm listening, Senior.

ID=260156011
Certainly, it can not leave it unattended.

ID=260156012
... How do you feel about yourself?

ID=260156013
Oh, you came.\nJust right. Please listen to it too.

ID=260156014
Continuing the talk, both Soul junk and Vesi ... recently the movement is strange.\nIt's like quiet before the storm ....

ID=260156015
Soul junk, as if commanded by someone,\nThey are gathering from the four sides to the sixth area.

ID=260156016
Vesi suddenly ceased motion and grew older.

ID=260156017
Commander, I think that there is no other choice but to attack with this directly.

ID=260156018
So new. Have a Vesi ....

ID=260156019
Wait, for Vesi, I will select a member and investigate directly.

ID=260156020
Oh? How is the wind blowing? I do not think I will go directly.

ID=260156021
Xenia.

ID=260156022
... I understand. Please do as you like.\nSo, Seoul Junk will investigate with me newly.

ID=260156023
Well, I will go.

ID=260156024
....

ID=260156025
Wait a minute, no.\nLet us do what we do.

ID=260156026
First of all, why Seoul Junk is gathering in the 6th area\nIt seems necessary to investigate.

ID=260156027
It is the first time for them to move like this.\nIt gathers in the sixth area as if it had received any order.

ID=260156028
According to the staff, one or two each of Seoul Junk's body gathering in the sixth area,\nIt seems to have strange fragments, it seems to be the first thing to see.

ID=260156029
The most suspicious thing now is its fragments.\nThat's why I'm going to pick up the debris from Seoul Junk in the 6th area.

ID=260156030
In truth, I'd like to command the annihilation of Seoul Junk in the 6th area,\nRather than that, it is now ahead of us to obtain and investigate debris.\nThe subsequent plan is from the results of the survey.

ID=260156031
It will be hard, but I asked.

ID=660156001
Oh, will you leave the fragments directly to Victor?

ID=660156002
The facilities for Seoul Junk investigation are not in place here,\nIt is quicker to hand over to Seoul Junk's continuing research at Victor.

ID=660156003
I will tell you to Victor from here, so please give me a sample.\nOkay, good luck.

ID=360156001
Secure the sample in the sixth area and take it to Victor.\nVictor will do something about it.

ID=601560201
I was waiting,%username%.\nI'm just ready for the survey.

ID=601560202
Can you get a sample?

ID=601560203
(I gave Victor the purple fragments I got from Soul Junk)

ID=601560204
Well ... It seems that it does not look like it changed.\nWell, if you look it up you will understand. I will begin to investigate.

ID=601560205
(JVC began hurriedly investigating debris)

ID=601560206
There is a trace like Vacuum Vane fusing here ....\nBut where is the vacuum bay? In the air?

ID=601560207
(I dropped the color reagent that Victor had never seen on the chip)

ID=601560208
(Over time, color smoke stood from the part where the reagent was dropped,\nA burst exploded along with the explosive sound of a bonnet)

ID=601560209
(As the smoke disappeared, intact debris appeared)

ID=601560210
Stupid ... Although it was a reagent containing Soul Energy it is intact ...! What?\nthis is ....

ID=601560211
%username% ....\nApparently, the situation seems more severe than I thought.

ID=601560212
The reagent I used earlier is a special reagent containing Soul Energy.\nIt is used to measure the amount and force of the vacuum bay which the fragments of soul junk have.

ID=601560213
Usually, by dropping this reagent one drop, depending on melting time and range of vacuum bay\nI can measure it.

ID=601560214
However ....

ID=601560215
This is my first reaction!\nKasa ... Go, Gogh ...! ... There was no such reaction at Amaryllis.

ID=601560216
Also, when Vacuum bay and Seoul Energy join together,\nMelting phenomena should occur in whatever form.\nBut, as you can see, the debris was intact and only the reagent evaporated ... ...

ID=601560217
I need more time to elucidate this ....\nBut I think, there are two possibilities. Neither is a good result though.

ID=601560218
One thing is that the energy of the sample had the power to surpass the soul energy.

ID=601560219
Second, the power of the sample is the natural enemy of Seoul Energy ....

ID=601560220
Until now, Seoul Junk was the sole natural enemy of Seoul Energy and Seoul workers.\nSo, human beings have survived until now.

ID=601560221
If it is the first possibility, I can manage it somehow ....\nIf the second possibility ... After the Vesi, the ability to compete with Seoul Energy\nIt is supposed to have appeared. And to Seoul Junk ....

ID=601560222
......

ID=601560223
Well, just by talking about the possibilities, it was not decided yet.\nYou should leave the current story in one corner of your head.

ID=601560224
If so it would have been impossible to get this sample.

ID=601560225
Anyway, I will study more in detail.\nAbout the sample, I will talk to Mr. Senia from me.\nEven if a misunderstanding is born, it is troublesome.

ID=601560301
Welcome back, new.\nI heard the story from JVC.

ID=601560302
I also heard the situation of the Vesi from the commander ....\nIt seems that Vesi disappeared.

ID=601560303
Even Vesh hide himself ....\nApparently, the situation seems to be going bad.

ID=601560304
Occurrence of abnormal blank ... Changed soul junk, disappeared Vesi ....

ID=601560305
It's not a storm ... It feels like it will come even at the end.

ID=601560306
Even if I think about it, it can not be helped!\nWhether it is a storm or an end, I will do what I can do now.

ID=601560307
For the time being, we will report this to the Union Headquarters and arrange measures,\nCan you investigate your own?

ID=601560308
Commander! Can you approve the submission of this report to the headquarters?

ID=601560309
Report ... What is that about? I do not remember getting it.

ID=601560310
Did you give a report on the golden aura and the report on The Thing resurrection?\nNo way ... You have not decided anything! What?

ID=601560311
Do not say foolish things! I approved here ... ... where have you been?

ID=601560312
Commander. Report that I have sent so far ... I never thought that I left it since I received it.\nIs not it?

ID=601560313
Hey, Senior ... Do not say bad things about people.\nWell then it sounds as if I was lazy to make a decision and was lazy!

ID=601560314
Do you have any evidence that is not so? (Gogogo)

ID=601560315
(It seems better to run away soon)

ID=601560316
......

ID=601560317
Just a moment.

ID=601560318
There are things I have to tell you.

ID=601560319
(Io seems to have a story)

ID=560156001
It was returned.

ID=460156001
There is something I want to talk about.

ID=260156501
As you appeared in this world, there were many changes.

ID=260156502
Of course it was also the purpose of "them"\nIt has flown to those who did not expect it.

ID=260156503
The recent situation is exactly that.

ID=260156504
I do not have time anymore.\nThe distortion of the world generated by them must be stopped before breaking the world.

ID=260156505
It was unexpected that I would intervene so soon in the world.\nIt seems time has come to finally complete the role as a recruiter.

ID=260156506
At the moment of finishing the role of the recorder, they ... they say, "Rothka" and "Kant"\nI will recognize that the existence of "I" is irregular for their plan.

ID=260156507
For their plan, variables like me are the object of annihilation.\nHowever, if you stop the collapse of this world by my guide,\nEven they can not let me quench them easily.

ID=260156508
But, it is possible because you are alive.\nEven if you can protect this world, I will disappear from this world once you are gone.

ID=260156509
So, I will ask you for the first time.

ID=260156510
Be sure to live and come back.

ID=260156511
(Io told you)

ID=260156512
Thank you very much.\nAfter all, it has come to such "time\

ID=260156517
As a recorder, I kept silent to watch over you,\nI am already at the center of this case with you ... with you.\nIn order not to lose you, I must teach.

ID=260156518
It is about the end of things that caused this series of situations.

ID=260156519
You should have noticed it a bit too ....\nYes ... this time is attributed to "Rothkar" that appeared in Ruin Fortress.\nTo be exact, it is because of "Kant" that disturbs Rothkar ....

ID=260156520
For Rosscar's "plan\\nBecause the result that it brings was your "death".\nThat's why she appeared.

ID=260156521
Thanks to her, you barely saved it,\nGears of causality that have been settled in the world are still narrowing your head.

ID=260156522
The result of her intervention embodied as distortion of the world,\nIt produces an irregular cause of abnormal whites, evokes even the remains of the past,\nI tried to erase you, but even that failed.

ID=260156523
And the distortion of the world also evoked "that".

ID=260156524
Sleeping in the abyss of absence and presence.\nIt may be said that it is the beginning of soul junk ....

ID=260156525
Originally, that existence can not come out of the darkness ... but, unusual blanks which are distortions of the world,\nIt occurred in this world, started to crack time and space, the darkness in the blank woke up.

ID=260156526
It existed in all the time and in all the space but did not exist.\nHowever, the past reappeared in this world, the axis of the world began to collapse.

ID=260156527
And, by your hands, it was suppressing the appearance of its existence,\nAll things disappeared.

ID=260156528
What was that suppression ... a precursor to the golden you defeated ....\n'Balance' was the only suppressor of this situation.

ID=260156529
I do not blame you.

ID=260156530
However, in the situation where you and me are situated,\nI talked to clarify what I have to do.\nDo not get me wrong.

ID=260156531
For this world, that your existence has become more exceptional\nI just want to tell you.

ID=260156532
(Suddenly, a strong shake occurred in Grace City)

ID=260156533
(The shake did not last so long and soon fell down)

ID=260156534
Perhaps it is not time left.

ID=260156535
Distortion began spreading to golden aura.\nDistortion that did not occur if the equilibrium existed here ... until that time ....

ID=260156536
A golden aura ... heading for Golden Citadel.\nThere, there is a gate leading to existence to stop.

ID=260156538
But the gate can not be opened easily.\nIt is because you have to wait for "time" to come there as that existence waited for the twist of the world.

ID=260156539
When it comes to ... ... even me ....\nBut, you should surely understand.

ID=260156540
Please.\nPlease stop that presence from appearing in this world.

ID=660156501
A gate will appear before you.\nDo not let the time escape ....

ID=360156501
Anyway, why has it suppressed the golden aura ... ... "equilibrium" so far?

ID=360156502
The distortion of the world once occurred in the past, and it appeared accordingly ....

ID=360156503
Perhaps it is against the power of 'equilibrium'\nYou can "guess" that something is there.

ID=360156504
If you can afford it, it may be good to make weapons with the remains of "equilibrium".

ID=601565201
It is safe and above all.\nDistortion which had spread to the world ceased.

ID=601565202
The world gradually regains stability.\nThanks to your success.

ID=601565203
Because the distortion of the world is stopped, that existence ... No, "The Primal" also\nIt will not be able to appear again in this world.

ID=601565204
But it is strange.

ID=601565205
Where the primal exists, there is nothing like darkness.\nIt was so written in my record ....

ID=601565206
But that place ... that place where you reached was a place similar to the sixth area of ​​this world.

ID=601565207
......

ID=601565208
What is it ....

ID=601565209
Other abnormal spaces are also so ....

ID=601565210
The abnormal whitespace that occurred in Locotown is a puppet resembling a clown of a blue flame and a hospital of ruins ....

ID=601565211
In the abnormal whitespace that occurred in Kandas city, the mutated spider type Soul junk\nKandathiti's underground waterway ....

ID=601565212
And in Grace City, the phantom you defeated appears again,\nIn Ruin Fortress, a robot that could not exist stood in front of you.

ID=601565213
What do these mean ...?

ID=601565214
......

ID=601565215
I'm sorry, I have caused an extra question.\nThe important thing is that it is not it.

ID=601565216
The axis of the world has returned to normal now.

ID=601565217
"Rothcar" will also be watching you safely.\nFrom now on, she should not intervene in a wrong manner.

ID=601565218
Because she knew that you have the power to protect yourself.

ID=601565219
It is about time to return.

ID=601565220
Many people are waiting for your return.\nYou had better go back in a hurry.

ID=601565221
... It may be better not to be returned ... but ... Huh.

ID=601565222
So, I will return to the mission of the recruiter.\nUntil that day full of time again.

ID=601565223
Take care.

ID=560156501
noob! ! Where are you going this time!

ID=560156502
I can not find it at all. Completely ....\nAs it is, the abnormal whites have disappeared while you are not there.\nJust as if it had not occurred from the beginning.

ID=560156503
......

ID=560156504
No way ... I guess you did not handle this case alone, did you?

ID=560156505
(It seems better not to talk this time)

ID=560156506
What? Is the exercise of silent rights before the end?\nIt makes me preoccupied with this before ... I am prepared for it, do not you? (Gogogogo ...)

ID=560156507
That's it, Senia.

ID=560156508
Oh, the commander. Are you going to protect newcomers?

ID=560156509
It is not.

ID=560156510
Then?

ID=560156511
It is because you have not made a new trauma.

ID=560156512
Well, that is to disturb you.\nKnowing what will happen ... Hey, finger, ruler, officer?

ID=560156513
Cut ... Will it be defeated!\nLeave this to me, get away early! ! !

ID=560156514
I will not escape!

ID=560156515
Can not you stop it?\nDo not expose abomination in front of the crew members from daytime.

ID=560156516
Colonel Hypo! But ... This is it!

ID=560156517
Do it now.\nThis child also needs rest. Why do not you submit a report later?

ID=460156501
... I understand.

ID=460156502
... Was saved.

ID=460156503
Commander, Shall I talk a little bit later.

ID=460156504
Hmm, I am busy. I have no such time.

ID=460156505
Hello ...!

ID=460156506
Xenia.

ID=460156507
Huh ... I understand!

ID=460156508
What happened ... I will not ask now.\nAnyway, I will be tired, so please take a day off.\nBut be sure to submit a report later.

ID=460156509
(I told you I understood, I left the spot immediately)

ID=460156510
Fuu ... is this OK?

ID=460156511
Ahh.

ID=460156512
In the first place, why solely this role?

ID=460156513
That's right, because you are such a right person ....

ID=460156514
Please do it.

ID=460156515
I do not know the details, but thanks to that girl, we live like this.

ID=460156516
That's right ... but ...!

ID=460156517
I'm sorry to her, but I keep it secret behind.\nEven a savior who has rescued us, there is no guarantee that you will be on your side.

ID=460156518
Thanks to that child, I could escape from one big disaster,\nNumerous disasters still hit us. In order to get over it safely ....

ID=460156519
Do not worry.\nThey should be conscious of it all about that.

ID=460156520
I see ... it is safe.

ID=460156521
......

ID=460156522
......

ID=460156523
Well, let 's start a play.

ID=260157001
Oh, that's right. Did not you see the hammer head on the control base?

ID=260157002
That robot seems to be relatively irregular artificial intelligence.

ID=260157003
......\nWell, to put it simply, it means stupid.

ID=260157004
But, they have a fine drill that can cover that Aho artificial intelligence.\nWould a truly robot have to be robust if it is bad? Ha ha ha.

ID=260157005
So ....\nActually there was an order from the coalition upper part to collect that drill and extend Ruin Fortress.

ID=260157006
As you know, I am a noncombatant.\nSo this order is impossible for me!

ID=260157007
... What are you standing up to?\nDo you understand so far?

ID=260157008
To be safe to say. Do not break it.

ID=360157001
I occasionally envy combatants.\nBecause you do not think about anything and just fight.

ID=460157001
(It does not seem to be good to talk over this ... let's go)

ID=560157001
Is this a rumor drill?

ID=560157002
It is quite heavy.

ID=560157003
I have to put such a heavy drill ... robots with low intelligence are struggling.

ID=560157004
After all I am not good at troublesome things ....\nThis work now is the best match for me.

ID=560157005
... Anyway, it was a pain.

ID=260157501
Hey, you.

ID=260157502
Bad, but would you ask me a favor?

ID=260157503
Fuu ... What should I talk about ....

ID=260157504
As you know, I was a member of Ned.

ID=260157505
Of course, I regret it.\nI am trying to recover from what I did in those days.

ID=260157506
However, after all it is a former Ned Company. The eyes around me are cold.

ID=260157507
It's like looking even criminals.

ID=260157508
I am no longer Ned.\nI want everyone to know about that.

ID=260157509
I thought about that, but would not it be easy to gain trust if I do something with Seoul workers?

ID=260157510
So let 's do the task with me! In that way I think that the eye of the surroundings will surely change.\nWhat? ask!

ID=360157501
If you disregard that baffle, your surrounding eyes will change too!

ID=460157501
Thank you.

ID=560157501
Fuu ~.\nThanks to you I finished safely.

ID=560157502
In this case, it seems that my eyes to see me changed a bit.

ID=560157503
No matter how much I regret the past, what is important is what I will do from now on?

ID=260158001
Haa ... What shall I do ....

ID=260158002
Actually ... I got a permission to go out with recognition of the achievement of this duty ....

ID=260158003
I thought it would be a great opportunity to meet a lover, so it would be nice to call near.

ID=260158004
I suddenly got a job done Bakayaro ぁ ぁ ぁ ぁ ぁ!

ID=260158005
Would you be willing to take the boyfriend who came all the way to such a distant place, return the dragonfly back?

ID=260158006
I'm sorry, but will you do a mission instead of me?

ID=360158001
really! What? Thank you! Well, I will go to see you!

ID=460158001
It is difficult to achieve balance between romance and work ....\nHuh ~.

ID=560158001
... Oh, welcome back.\nApparently it seems that the mission finished successfully ....

ID=560158002
Huh\nI'm glad that I let you go to the office and go out ....

ID=560158003
After all I was concerned about the duty and fought with her ... ....

ID=560158004
In such a case, I should have let go out after carrying out my duties myself.

ID=560158005
Huh ~.\nDoes that mean I am mature as a soldier?\n... I'm sorry.

ID=260158501
%username%!\nIt's bad, can you ask me one?

ID=260158502
From the upper part, there is an offer to explore Buster Core, create a precise map and report it.

ID=260158503
Usually I will have the troopers do it ....\nThere was a big turbulence in somewhere else.

ID=260158504
In order to investigate the cause of the disturbance, all the troops were dispatched there.\nHa ha ha!

ID=260158505
Yup?\nWhy am I left here?

ID=260158506
I am a noncombatant! It is visible that you will be at your feet when you have gone.

ID=260158507
And the main reason is ....

ID=260158508
....

ID=260158509
Because I do not want to be troublesome!

ID=260158510
So, I dispatched a crew member and thought that I would spend my free time alone ... /.

ID=260158511
Ooo! Well anyway.\nI'd like to ask you for this duty in relation now that everyone is paying off.

ID=360158501
I graciously relaxed ... Why?\nI do not have time! I'm busy with other jobs!

ID=460158501
Anyway, it was a pain.\nThanks to that, I was able to successfully accomplish my duty without care. Ha ha ha!

ID=560158501
(I explained the structure of Buster Core to Martin)

ID=560158502
It's simpler than I thought ....

ID=560158503
Thank you.\nI will report it to the upper part.

ID=560158504
... Oops it looks like.\nCan I write the name of%username%?

ID=560158505
If there are points that do not agree with the structure you taught, it may be a bit tricky.

ID=560158506
However, if you write the name of the soul worker%username%, it may be passed through.\nWell ... Does silence mean that you can agree?

ID=260159001
What ... what is this ...?

ID=260159002
Ah! %username%! !\nNice Timing Goo! !

ID=260159003
It's bad, can you please ask me a favor?

ID=260159004
(I asked Betty the contents)

ID=260159005
Actually ...\nIn the communication troops, there are parts that have excess inventory occasionally.

ID=260159006
Such parts were mostly going to the control store or discarded.

ID=260159007
But, I was thinking ... ....\nIt's a waste to throw it away.

ID=260159008
there!

ID=260159009
I would like to make a device to disturb the robot's AI using that waste!

ID=260159010
How? Is not it nice?

ID=260159011
I was progressing quite nice feeling ... but a problem has arisen ....

ID=260159012
There are important circuits in the equipment, not in the waste ....

ID=260159013
I found out here and there,\nThe spider circuit matches what I am seeking!

ID=260159014
That 's why ... will you come down with that circuit?

ID=360159001
It's a spider circuit! What? Do not break it! What?

ID=460159001
It is frustrating! !\nI will absolutely complete it!

ID=560159001
Oh!\nIs this the circuit?

ID=560159002
The real thing is amazing ~.

ID=560159003
I have to apply it immediately!

ID=560159004
(Betty attached circuit to A.I disturber)

ID=560159005
Wow! ! Get nervous !\nOkay ... switch! Oh! ! !

ID=560159006
(With the loud noise, smoke can fall)

ID=560159007
Ha ha!\nLie ... this is supposed to be ....\nWhat was wrong with you?

ID=260159501
The brave of the reversal ... is a synonym for me that passed.

ID=260159502
Owing to this alias, I often be delegated missions outside my capacity ....

ID=260159503
Although I want to go back home and have a break again ....

ID=260159504
I am in trouble by having two tasks at the same time this time as well.

ID=260159505
Even though I have only one body ....

ID=260159506
Huh\nI can not meet my beloved lover ...

ID=260159507
(I told Sense that I will help)

ID=260159508
Huh ...?\nreally?\nI did it! !

ID=260159509
Thank you!\nI am going for words!

ID=260159510
Well, let me explain the mission ... Uh ....\nThere are two duties ....

ID=260159511
One is a bit tough, so it is a bit of a hard time to leave.

ID=260159512
Well, I'm in a gold revenge,\nI will leave the robotic destruction mission "ghost"!

ID=360159501
I'm sorry, but please!

ID=460159501
I was really saved!

ID=560159501
Uhh!\nAfter all the soul workers are different!

ID=560159502
Actually, such a task I thought that nobody could do it ....

ID=260160001
Oh no!\nThis too failed ....

ID=260160002
Yup? What is it?\nSince when have you been doing that?

ID=260160003
Fuu ~.\nI am studying a new reinforcement method now.

ID=260160004
I'm studying ways to strengthen equipment at high temperatures, not existing reinforcement methods ....

ID=260160005
I can not think of a way to cool that high temperature instantly ....

ID=260160006
... Wait a minute!\nThat's it! !\nWhy did not you come up with such a thing?

ID=260160007
Hey%username%!\nWill you listen to my request?

ID=260160008
If you are afternoon!

ID=260160009
Do you know that there is a guy in the gold revenge robot called cut throat?

ID=260160010
We have heard that the propeller of the Germans is able to blow a tremendous strong wind.

ID=260160011
If you use that strong wind, you can cool the high temperature instantly!

ID=260160012
I'm begging you!

ID=360160001
If this method succeeds, free for the rest of my life ...,\nI will not be able to do it, but I will strengthen it cheaply ~.

ID=460160001
Thank you for bringing in new research materials!

ID=560160001
Is this the propeller?

ID=560160002
You are lighter than it looks?

ID=560160003
Titanic alloy? Or lightweight alloy?

ID=560160004
What the hell ...?\nWhy is it so light?

ID=560160005
Yup? Enhance?

ID=560160006
Right now it is not!

ID=560160007
It is more important to study such a sturdy and light metal.

ID=260160501
Do you know how fragile Ruin Fortress's communication security is?

ID=260160502
Especially the frequency! Because the robots here are using different frequencies.

ID=260160503
Among them, the robot called auto punisher seems to be using the frequency bandwidth almost.

ID=260160504
If I destroy him, I should be able to stabilize communication security ....

ID=260160505
Then why will not you destroy that auto punisher?

ID=260160506
The reason is easy!

ID=260160507
There is no one with a fighting power enough to destroy him!

ID=260160508
Huh? ♪ So far ... you understand?

ID=260160509
You can destroy it, do not you?

ID=360160501
Please!

ID=460160501
Thanks and saved!\nThank you in the future ~.

ID=560160501
Haha! As I thought, the bandwidth of the frequency was full!

ID=560160502
Sis is a soul worker!

ID=260161001
Hey, I'm sorry, but may I ask you a favor?

ID=260161002
It is a personal request, though.

ID=260161003
A while ago, the communication troops were hit hard.

ID=260161004
Suddenly many of the members were injured, so if you investigate the cause ... ...

ID=260161005
It was because of the robot "auto fire ruler".

ID=260161006
I did not like robots so much from the beginning, but I completely disliked it.

ID=260161007
I want to beat him directly, but ... I ... I have to take care of the men ....

ID=260161008
So ... may I ask a favor?

ID=360161001
Because it is a personal request ... If you let me quiet, it will not be saved.

ID=460161001
Thanks to that, our members are getting better a little bit.\nThanks dear.

ID=560161001
Huh\nWhat can I do if I break all robots that exist in Ruin Fortress.

ID=260161501
Recently I'm studying robots in Fogatton Armory.

ID=260161502
Okay. Huh

ID=260161503
I do not know which robot is so powerful,\nThe soldiers who are cooperating with us have quite done.

ID=260161504
I would like to thru if possible, but something persistently attacks me ....

ID=260161505
I can not leave this alone.

ID=260161506
I'm sorry but%username%, can you cooperate, too?

ID=260161507
It's a little troublesome, but please defeat "Ward Loan" in Fogatton Armory.

ID=360161501
Please also to prevent damage beyond now.

ID=460161501
Say hello in the future.

ID=560161501
Oh? Are you back already?

ID=560161502
I was worried about what to do if you injured me.

ID=560161503
So the soul worker is different after all?

ID=560161504
In this case it seems to be trusted.

ID=260162001
Haa ~ hey hey ....

ID=260162002
Ah! welcome!

ID=260162003
A customer who orders large quantities after a long time has appeared!

ID=260162004
Ha ha ha! So I was preparing to panic, but ....

ID=260162005
We ordered strange tools ....

ID=260162006
What was that ...?

ID=260162007
Mo ... Motor? It was a must ....\nPlease wait a moment!

ID=260162008
(Jaight reviews the purchase order)

ID=260162009
Ah! There was!\nEr ... zero motor?

ID=260162010
Anyway, I need it,\nI do not have that kind of thing.

ID=260162011
I am not looking for anything else, so what did you do ...?

ID=260162012
It seems like you can get it from a robot in deep core,\nI do not have time to go there and come back.

ID=260162013
Daitou ... a mass order for the first time in a long time ... but ....\nShould I give up ...?

ID=260162014
(I will tell you to bring it to the jite)

ID=260162015
eh! What?\nMagis?

ID=260162016
Well then, sit down!

ID=360162001
It's a motor that you can get from drone zero!

ID=460162001
That ... that!

ID=560162001
Is the motor available?

ID=560162002
(Jitt looks pretty much for the Dron zero motor)

ID=260162501
T ... That's awful!

ID=260162502
I ... my order form, something I misunderstood ....

ID=260162503
If I look closely, I was writing a ghost zero motor ....

ID=260162504
To make such a rudimentary mistake ....\nIt looks like I was a bit scared.

ID=260162505
I am sorry ... Is it a good idea to bring a ghost zero motor?

ID=360162501
This time it's definitely a ghost zero motor!\nI confirmed properly, so there is no problem!

ID=460162501
Ha ha ha!\nThank you!

ID=560162501
Oh!\nThat's right! This is it!

ID=560162502
This is the item you ordered, you can arrange them all!

ID=260163001
N.E. D probably had a considerable difficulty in mass producing battle robots.

ID=260163002
Make the best robot with cheap unit price ....

ID=260163003
Yup ...?\nWas it really done?

ID=260163004
I heard that the strategy was canceled just before it was done.

ID=260163005
The reason is ... it is probably because of the coalition as you know.

ID=260163006
If that were done, a big war would have happened.

ID=260163007
However, it seems that mass-produced robots made at that time still remain here in Ruin Fortress.

ID=260163008
If all it is destroyed, will not N.E. D stop mass production of fighting robots in the future?

ID=360163001
Although it is the origin of mass-production robots, the fighting power is not half-end.\nYou'd better tighten your mind.

ID=460163001
Anyway, this is a relief.\nThank you.

ID=560163001
Blade Wolf?

ID=560163002
It is something that seems like a bad name.

ID=560163003
Do not be disappointed with N.E.D's naming sense.

ID=260163501
Hey.\n%username%.

ID=260163502
Really ... did you defeat Noah?

ID=260163503
That Noah will be knocked down ....\nIncredible ....

ID=260163504
If you knocked down Noah, there must have been something wrong with Ruin Fortress.

ID=260163505
But when you look at places you do not see, Noah is still alive?

ID=260163506
Ah! I will never believe you.

ID=260163507
I ... I just saw the mighty power of the near soul worker ....

ID=260163508
It's bad, but I think it is necessary to confirm the survival of Noah.\nSo why do not you go to the deep core again?

ID=260163509
So please check Noah's survival.

ID=360163501
If I were alive ....\nShould I be settled ...?

ID=460163501
After all the near soul worker seems not to be able to do so easily ....

ID=560163501
... I was still alive.

ID=560163502
Thank you.

ID=260164001
Ahaha ....\nCompletely ....

ID=260164002
You know that the Crow Dream Alliance Bank protects your valuable property, is not it?

ID=260164003
Here at Ruin Fortress, we make a large safe and protect your property.

ID=260164004
The property we have entered into me will enter the large safe after a safe moving route.

ID=260164005
However, a while ago, it seems that robots robbed part of property during the transfer of property.

ID=260164006
I was robbed ... No.\nIt is better to say that I've been eaten ....

ID=260164007
Ah!\nOf course, since your bank promises to recover all your important assets, please feel relieved.

ID=260164008
However, if you keep it as it is, you will see the same thing again.

ID=260164009
Therefore, the Allied Bank is looking for talent who can solve this problem.

ID=260164010
how is it?

ID=260164011
I think that you can solve it enough if%username% is enough?

ID=260164012
If you feel like that, I will be waiting.

ID=360164001
I can eat it with a robot ....\nI am amazed and can not say anything.

ID=460164001
From now on, we will strive to secure safe and secure banks.

ID=560164001
After all, it is owner of superb ability.

ID=560164002
Is something for them ... Is it a special A.I that eats things?

ID=560164003
As it is good, I will thank you on behalf of the Alliance Bank.

ID=260164501
I heard it by chance, but I think he is the one who says Sprinter in Akeron\nIt seems that a special communication device is built in the circuit.

ID=260164502
Well, will you recover the circuit of that sprinter?\nWith that, you will be able to communicate individually regardless of the Union.

ID=260164503
Well, I will prepare a corresponding reward ♪

ID=260164504
Well then, be careful ~ ♪

ID=360164501
As individual communication becomes possible, family members will be able to confirm their safety at any time.

ID=460164501
Well done! I will prepare the promise promise properly.

ID=560164501
Is this the example circuit?

ID=560164502
More complicated than I thought ....\nAll right! Utilizing this circuit, ♪ must be remodeled for communication

ID=260165001
A little nice?

ID=260165002
Going to Akeron Do you not need business?

ID=260165003
I think that it will be understood if I go to Akeron, but there seems to be a lot of communication facilities left over there.

ID=260165004
I thought that I could modify the communication equipment a bit and use it in the coalition ....

ID=260165005
That iron scrap giant!\nHeavy Earth Quaker was interrupted by me!

ID=260165006
Actually I'd like to crush it with my Tekken fist,\nIt seemed a bit hard, I came back with keeping my feelings down.

ID=260165007
Mr.\nIt is annoying just to remember.

ID=260165008
I'm sorry, will you kill me a heavy earthquaker instead of me?

ID=360165001
You do not have to overdo it.\nJust enough to turn iron scrap into powder was enough.

ID=460165001
Thank you.\nIf you get angry fellows again, I will ask you.

ID=560165001
Heavy Earth Quaker made powder?

ID=560165002
How was it?\nThat sight I wanted to see it too.

ID=560165003
that? You have not done that?\nWhy, it seemed to be hard.

ID=560165004
But thanks for breaking down. I refreshed.

ID=260165501
Have you ever seen an assault ward loan in Akeroon?

ID=260165502
(I answered that I saw it)

ID=260165503
so? Well then it was good.

ID=260165504
Actually I've known it recently,\nThere seems to be many confidential documents of Ned in the head of the assault ward loan.

ID=260165505
Normally you keep confidential documents in a safe place right?

ID=260165506
My open mouth does not close.\nI think Ned Company really thinks unexpected.

ID=260165507
As expected ... ... If you are caught in common sense you do not understand anything.

ID=260165508
It's bad, will you destroy the assault ward loan and bring the head part?

ID=260165509
Of course my thanks go.

ID=360165501
Oh, that's right. Do not hurt the head part?\nBecause it can not read data if it gets damaged.

ID=460165501
Well what is truly soul worker.

ID=560165501
This is the head.

ID=560165502
OK, then\nLet's load the data.

ID=560165503
(Sarah connected the cable and the data)

ID=560165504
You feel good!\nI was saved!

ID=260166001
Damn it!\nPlease ask me to start up!

ID=260166002
Huh ... that's too late.

ID=260166003
Your Is this?\nThis is a kind of discriminating machine that discriminates the number of individuals equipped with AI.

ID=260166004
If it is not a big deal but you can determine the number of robots with AI,\nI wonder if it will be useful for the coalition a little.

ID=260166005
But, it does not start anyway This is it.

ID=260166006
I know the cause.\nThere is a guy in the AI ​​robot that interferes with this radio wave.

ID=260166007
It's a robot called Dominia ... it seems to be in Akeron.\nHave you seen it?

ID=260166008
If you have business to go to Akeron, destroy Dominia.

ID=260166009
If it is not even him, I'm sure I can start it.

ID=360166001
At this time, you do not have to destroy it so that you can never start it again.

ID=460166001
I will wear it!

ID=560166001
Did you destroy them all?\nIn this short time?

ID=560166002
Just as expected ....

ID=560166003
Oops, this was not the case.\nI have to start up the machine.

ID=560166004
(Ian quickly starts the machine)

ID=560166005
Oh! Hey! It moved and moved!\nWell it was saved.

ID=260166501
Ah! Can you help me for a moment?

ID=260166502
Do you know that Akeron has an earthworm like an earth worm?

ID=260166503
It seems that the joint part of the robot can be used as a weapon core material.

ID=260166504
You know, I guess I bought this kind of thing, did not I?\nGood is quick! To!

ID=260166505
By doing it,\nI'd like you to pick up joints from that iron worm.

ID=260166506
I asked for it!

ID=360166501
It seems that it is in the shuttle's moving road area, but usually seems to be submerged.\nWell, if you come in and make noise, you ought to come out over there.

ID=460166501
Mounds! Thanks!\nIt's decomposition!

ID=560166501
Is this so?

ID=560166502
Uoo ... It is dirtier than I thought.\nCan we really make weapon core with this ...?

ID=260167001
%username%.

ID=260167002
Did you really defeat Enoch?

ID=260167003
It is hard to believe that Enoch will be destroyed.

ID=260167004
If you defeat the near soul worker Enoch, even Ruin Fortress should be more talkative.

ID=260167005
Looking at places you do not listen to such stories at all, is Enoch still alive?

ID=260167006
Oh, I do not doubt you.

ID=260167007
I just saw the strength of the near soul worker, so I can only believe it.

ID=260167008
Sorry, I want you to check if Enoch is alive.\nWill you look over with Akeron again?

ID=260167009
I only have to check if Enoch is alive.

ID=360167001
If I were alive ... should I get settled?

ID=460167001
After all I can not easily do Nia soul worker ....

ID=560167001
As I thought, I was alive.

ID=560167002
There was no longer being touched.\nThank you.

ID=260167501
You are busy with robot arrest in the arc ship area recently?\nThere is a request as a member of the Merchant Association for a moment.

ID=260167502
A while ago, I was robbed by the robot while collecting parts at the arc - ship.\nOf course all the luggage was lost ... Mostly it was scrap iron.

ID=260167503
It was a high part, it was a lot, so I wanted to collect it anyhow ....\nAs a result of checking it was already incinerated.

ID=260167504
It is not possible to do such a thing other than an incineration robot called an auto fire ruler.

ID=260167505
Please erase that evil robot from this world right now!

ID=260167506
Please never destroy such a tragedy ... destroy the auto fire ruler.

ID=360167501
If there are any parts that are safe, they will also be collected.\nThank you!

ID=460167501
As expected ... after all.

ID=560167501
Did you destroy the auto fire ruler?

ID=560167502
Parts are not ... right?\nA bit ... was not it?\nHuh?

ID=560167503
(Tell Yomei that it was all burnt down)

ID=260168001
I heard that the Sprinter is made of a powerful alloy.

ID=260168002
Although it was told to the wealthy businessmen trading in weapons that you wanted to check strength once,\nUnfortunately I have no ability to reach Sprinter.

ID=260168003
So, can not you check the alloy strength of Sprinter instead of me?

ID=360168001
If I can check the strength of the Sprinter, I'm sure it will be useful in the future.\nPlease do.

ID=460168001
I look forward to working with you!

ID=560168001
Oh, how was it?

ID=560168002
What is the state of the alloy of Sprinter?\nAnd strength!

ID=560168003
(Tell the state of the alloy of the Sprinter to the jute)

ID=560168004
Fuu ....

ID=560168005
That's about it, the weapons sold by me is harder.

ID=560168006
As expected!\nHigh quality Jait original weapons are unbeatable!

ID=260168501
%username%.\nI just thought of calling.

ID=260168502
It is said that great masters are interested in arc - ship 's robot.

ID=260168503
Whew. You ought to go by myself if you care so much.\nDo not you think so?

ID=260168504
How hard did I do this\nYou will end with a word of "hard work".

ID=260168505
I suppose it should not be done until then so it should not be content.

ID=260168506
If I have business to go to the arc - ship, will you defeat the dreadbuster?

ID=260168507
See you soon. At last.

ID=360168501
It is useless project as long as you do your best.

ID=460168501
If you advise as a senior in life ....\n"Tequilo is the best".

ID=560168501
... Hmm?\nWhat happened?

ID=560168502
Ah that?

ID=560168503
It was a pain.

ID=560168504
Everyone was doing fine?

ID=560168505
....

ID=560168506
....

ID=560168507
Ah?\nThe matter of Dreadbuster?

ID=560168508
You can leave it untill the reminder comes from above.

ID=560168509
Anyway it's not important.\nYou do not want to be useless, do you?

ID=260169001
How's it going lately?\nNewcomer soul worker.

ID=260169002
This time, how much is Hal's soul gauge with different ability\nThere was a request from the coalition to grasp.

ID=260169003
I think it is a good opportunity for Haru.\nYou can figure out how to fight by knowing your limits.

ID=260169004
Moreover! If you get it, it seems you can get a certain reward from the coalition?

ID=260169005
Well, start?

ID=260169006
Well, for the beginning ....\nCan you control over the powerful robots here in Ruin Fortress?

ID=260169007
How much does it matter?

ID=360169001
It is OK if you do not mind, you can abandon at any time.\nOf course, there is no reward! Hehuhu.

ID=460169001
Lost ~ ....\nOh ... a terrible soul gauge.\nThe data seems to be too huge and it takes a while to decipher it.

ID=560169001
Do not you? Did you want to quit?

ID=560169002
Huh? I had already finished?\nI thought it would cost me more ....

ID=560169003
After all, with pure soul workers and near soul workers,\nI wonder if it is totally different?

ID=260169501
Oh, Haru.\nFrom a little while ago, I was investigating an error during data decoding.\nNo way ... I guess the robot does not control everything, right?

ID=260169502
You said clearly, are not you? Let's control everything.\nThere are things to be careless even for soul workers.

ID=260169503
Absolutely ... give another chance.\nDo not worry, I will reward you properly.

ID=360169501
Do you control everything?\nBecause there is no next time?

ID=460169501
After all it is amazing.\nGood job.

ID=560169501
Oh! Have you already returned?\nReally, it's pretty early.

ID=560169502
He looked like he was misunderstanding about Haru.\nI'm sorry.

ID=560169503
Yes, it's a promise promise.

ID=260171002
This time, how much is Lily's soul gauge with different ability\nThere was a request from the coalition to grasp.

ID=260171003
I think it is a good opportunity for Lily.\nYou can figure out how to fight by knowing your limits.

This time, how much is Stella's soul gauge with different ability\nThere was a request from the coalition to grasp.

ID=260172003
I think it is a good opportunity for Stella.\nYou can figure out how to fight by knowing your limits.

ID=260172004
Moreover! If you get it, it seems you can get a certain reward from the coalition?

ID=260172005
Well, start?

ID=260172006
Well, for the beginning ....\nCan you control over the powerful robots here in Ruin Fortress?

ID=260172007
How much does it matter?

ID=360172001
It is OK if you do not mind, you can abandon at any time.\nOf course, there is no reward! Hehuhu.

ID=460172001
Lost ~ ....\nOh ... a terrible soul gauge.\nThe data seems to be too huge and it takes a while to decipher it.

ID=560172001
Do not you? Did you want to quit?

ID=560172002
Huh? I had already finished?\nI thought it would cost me more ....

ID=560172003
After all, with pure soul workers and near soul workers,\nI wonder if it is totally different?

ID=260172501
Oh, Stella-chan.\nFrom a little while ago, I was investigating an error during data decoding.\nNo way ... I guess the robot does not control everything, right?

ID=260172502
You said clearly, are not you? Let's control everything.\nThere are things to be careless even for soul workers.

ID=260172503
Absolutely ... give another chance.\nDo not worry, I will reward you properly.

ID=360172501
Do you control everything?\nBecause there is no next time?

ID=460172501
After all it is amazing.\nGood job.

ID=560172501
Oh! Have you already returned?\nReally, it's pretty early.

ID=560172502
I guess you misunderstood about Stella.\nI'm sorry.

ID=560172503
Yes, it's a promise promise.

ID=260173001
How's it going lately?\nNewcomer soul worker.

ID=260173002
This time, how much is Iris' soul gauge with different ability\nThere was a request from the coalition to grasp.

ID=260173003
I think that it is a good opportunity for Iris.\nYou can figure out how to fight by knowing your limits.

ID=260173004
Moreover! If you get it, it seems you can get a certain reward from the coalition?

ID=260173005
Well, start?

ID=260173006

ID=560173001
Do not you? Did you want to quit?

ID=560173002

ID=560173003

ID=260173501
Oh, Iris.\nFrom a little while ago, I was investigating an error during data decoding.\nNo way ... I guess the robot does not control everything, right?

ID=560173502
I guess you misunderstood about Iris.\nI'm sorry.

ID=560173503
Yes, it's a promise promise.

ID=260304001
A little new.\nYour request is coming.

ID=260304002
There are request documents, but wait for a moment.\nWhere is it ...?

ID=260304003
(Amanda is fishing a bunch of documents)

ID=260304004
It was there! This is this.\nThe sender is ...?

ID=260304005
Booker TV in the 6th area.\nWhy is that guy ....

ID=260304006
You know that Booker TV betrayed his family and is sided by humans, do not you?\nHowever, although it will lend the power, after all it is Vesi.

ID=260304007
He betrayed his family because of his profit.\nI'm sure that we will return the palm immediately as soon as we lose benefits.

ID=260304008
Suspicion is doubtful, but the Union is currently in a friendly relationship with Booker TV, so I can not help it.\nPersonally, it is a person I want to drive out.

ID=260304009
Such a guy asks you through the coalition ....\nSuspicious odor gets fucked hard.

ID=260304010
This time it is! Or! It was! What! ! I just do it!\nAbsolutely not to be careful.

ID=601740101
I was waiting ~ ~.\nAmanda did not say anything?

ID=601740102
Ah! Let me see you guess.\nWell ... you guys were saying bad things about Me?

ID=601740103
how is it? Do you match?\nPart As long as you see the expression, it seems to match.

ID=601740104
Amanda has not heard about Me yet\nYou seem to be in doubt.

ID=601740105
Huh? Is there anything wrong with Amanda?\nNo, it is not a big deal.

ID=601740106
Was it the first day that Mee cooperated with the coalition?\nA beautiful woman is getting caught up in a tough time ~!

ID=601740107
So, I made it a little silent with Me charisma ~.

ID=601740108
Huh? What did you do ...?\nIt is confidential information so I can not tell you ~.

ID=601740109
Well aside from that, could you please ask me a favor?\nRecently there are abnormalities in the movement of soul junk around here ~.

ID=601740110
Looking at the recent moves of these people here ....\nApparently they seem to be absorbing something in the sixth area, are not they?

ID=601740111
Will it be born again ...?

ID=601740112
Seoul Junk seems to be gaining power in the soulstone it has\nI do not have any idea what it is.

ID=601740113
If soul junk got a strong power ....\nMy important sixth area will be deprived of themselves ~.

ID=601740114
I just want to stop it even at all costs, is not it ~!

ID=601740115
Me is sending information of Vesi to the Union ~.\nI guess the safety here is guaranteed but I think that punishment will not be hit ~.

ID=601740116
Well then, thank you ~.

ID=360304001
It will not be tolerable for Seoul Junk to be torn here.

ID=460304001
this is ....\nIt looks like it will sell higher.

ID=460304002
It was a pleasant experience ~.

ID=560304001
Is this the bail doll that Seoul Junk had?

ID=560304002
Well, for the moment, I was able to recover this\nThere will not be soul junk gathering any more ~.

ID=560304003
We need to investigate Bild Seoul a bit more,\nAs far as I can see, there seems to be no doubtful power ~!

ID=560304004
Perhaps Seoul Junk is calling something\nI think I was collecting power ~.

ID=560304005
Huh?\nWhat do you call?

ID=560304006
I do not have any difficulty if I know it ~.\nIf I understand it, it may be able to control the world ...

ID=560304007
Anyway, do not worry as it is not dangerous ~.

ID=260304501
Soul workers.\nIs there no longer a build stone?

ID=260304502
Me 's genius brains are screaming when this is gold.

ID=260304503
Do not you think that it is only money to move this obsolete world ~?\nThe power of money is great ~.

ID=260304504
Well anyway, I think that this shining object can be sold higher if it hits the hands of Me.

ID=260304505
<ソウルジャンクが持つ唯一の宝「ソウルストーン」>

ID=260304506
Waah ... How are you?\nDo not you think it is a good name?

ID=260304507
It does not have to be superlatives ~.\nBe sure to sell higher, please bring it if you find it ~.

ID=360304501
A shining object without this useless thing is worth more than jewels for the rich ~?\nI mean that I will make effective use of those cloudy people with such eyes ~.

ID=460304501
Well ... Thank you!

ID=560304501
Oh! Mee's angel!\nDid you get help?

ID=560304502
Gee\nIt has been quite broken again ~.

ID=560304503
Well ... this is ....\nNo, weight.

ID=560304504
Haha!\nThat hand was there ~!

ID=560304505
If this is called "ancient" ... "Limited Edition" it is likely to sell ~!

ID=260175501
This ... What is it?

ID=260175502
Hmm? Oh! Just the right place!

ID=260175503
Do you know anything about anomalous whites with attributes?

ID=260175504
Thanks to you,\nAlthough it is preventing the approach of the abnormal space to some extent ....

ID=260175505
Apparently that blank,\nIt seems to affect people as well.

ID=260175506
Whether adults are immunized to a certain extent, there is not much influence ....\nThe problem is children.

ID=260175507
Especially the youngest secessor in Loco Town, has recently released high temperature heat.\nI tried doing the examination too ....

ID=260175508
I do not know the cause at all.

ID=260175509
Heat in the body is much higher\nAs far as regretting as a doctor, there is no technique to do at the moment ....

ID=260175510
However, I heard a story from Mr. Benjamin.

ID=260175511
With the influence of an abnormal whitespace with attributes, people may become abnormally high heat ... and so on.

ID=260175512
So, while asking Mr. Benjamin to cooperate, I have tried out the symptoms caused by abnormal voids ....

ID=260175513
It is exactly the same as Setsuka's current symptoms.

ID=260175514
When I was headed for something to treat, I got the information you gathered with anomalous blanks at hand.\nAs far as I see it, I found that there is a substance called reagent of reality.

ID=260175515
If there is enough for it, the symptoms of Setsuka will also improve!

ID=260175516
Sorry ... I am in the last carnival of the brilliant\nWill you bring me a brilliant reagent!

ID=360175501
Setsuka ....\nIt will be a bit more patience ....

ID=360175502
... ask.

ID=460175501
Oh ... Thank you.\nJeje.

ID=560175501
It is painful.\nUh ....

ID=560175502
(Hurry up and let Setsuka drink reagent)

ID=560175503
Gok ... What is this?\nHurry up.

ID=560175504
Did you make Sekka drink reagent?

ID=560175505
OK, let's see.\nSetsuka, I will consult a bit.

ID=560175506
Yup ....

ID=560175507
(Warren consults Setsuka)

ID=560175508
Ya ... I did it!\nThe fever will go down!

ID=560175509
God ... Thank you!\nSetsuka! How is your health?

ID=560175510
Well ... I was painful earlier,\nIt became a little easier.

ID=560175511
Apparently it seems that there was an effect on that reagent.\nFuu ... I'm glad.

ID=560175512
... Is Setsuka okay now?

ID=560175513
It has not completely cured yet.\nSorry, secret service.

ID=560175514
But, in order to cure disease of Setsuka\nI promise I will do my best. So just stand a little more.

ID=560175515
O.K. I understand.\nBecause Setsuka is an adult, I will endure it.

ID=560175516
Thank you, soul worker.\nThe symptoms of Setsuka have improved thanks to you.

ID=560175517
Setsuka.\nYou say thank you?

ID=260176001
You officially ordered from the coalition to you.

ID=260176002
The content is to investigate the inside of the abnormal whitespace with the attribute you entered before.

ID=260176003
....

ID=260176004
No matter how much Seoul workers, it is still impossible for you to make a mistake on your children ....

ID=260176005
Is it bad, will you again come into an abnormal blank with attributes?

ID=260176006
... If you do not like it, I will protest against the Union directly and have me withdraw the order.\nThat's why I will not be bothered.

ID=260176007
I'm sorry to break your story.\nMajor is now ... Warning Is not it cumulative?

ID=260176008
What ... what are you talking about!\nCertainly, there have been times I have rebelled against the orders of the senior officials, but until cumulative ....

ID=260176009
Warning five times due to default.\nAt the sixth time, she was canceled as a senior leader ... ....

ID=260176010
... Was it wrong?\nShall I show you the report again?

ID=260176011
......\nEven if the position is canceled, I can not expose the life of this child to danger just because it is a soul worker.

ID=260176012
Therefore, decide with your intention.

ID=260176013
As long as you are here, no one can force you to do anything.

ID=260176014
(It seems I have no choice but to go ...)

ID=260176015
Really ....\nThere is no help if your will is ....

ID=260176016
Can you pursue successfully?\nIf you stop, it will not be too late now.

ID=260176017
Major! !\nThis child says that he will go with his own will! What?

ID=260176018
If I have been doing it forever, I will protest against the Union with my own will of oppression!

ID=260176019
...... it can not be helped.

ID=260176020
Soul worker!\nWhat you should do is bring back the information inside the last carnival of evil!

ID=260176021
Perform a dutiful job!

ID=260176022
......

ID=260176023
you have to ....\nLiving back ... this is an order!

ID=260176024
It's okay with your ability. You can come back safe.

ID=260176025
Believing and waiting.

ID=360176001
You can stop now even now ...?

ID=360176002
(Sunny is staring at Benjamin ...)

ID=360176003
Well ... tight!

ID=460176001
It was troublesome! .\nPlease take a good rest.

ID=560176001
It seems they came back safely.

ID=560176002
Report the information you brought back to the Union.

ID=560176003
Better ... are they really injured?\nIf something happens to Sunny ....

ID=560176004
(Sunny is staring at Benjamin ...)

ID=560176005
Go ... Gokhon!

ID=260176501
I heard that I went to blank with attributes.

ID=260176502
It's about Soul Junk there ....

ID=260176503
Information is missing.\nIf I was attacked while I was away ....

ID=260176504
... destruction is inevitable.

ID=260176505
This is a personal request, but ...

ID=260176506
Have my clothes install small data chips.\nThen go to the last carnival of the attribute and kill Seoul Junk.

ID=260176507
(Does not say whether or not, Liu attached data chips to clothes)

ID=260176508
In this situation, it will not be talked about without information.

ID=260176509
... What happened?\nDo not want it?

ID=260176510
Well ... If you say that you do not mind sacrificing people here, you do not have to go.

ID=260176511
Speaking of ..., you can not disagree?

ID=260176512
What I want you to go to is that, among the blanks with attributes,\nIt is the most grasped "cool last carnival".

ID=260176513
Soul workers believe that they can come back safely after taking the data.

ID=260176514
Well then, I asked.

ID=360176501
Are you planning to abandon it?

ID=360176502
... Well, I can not compel a bad thing.\nHowever, I am worried about Setsuka and Ryoko.

ID=460176501
It was a hard time.

ID=560176501
You seem to have returned safely.

ID=560176502
... ....

ID=560176503
Is the data chip safe?

ID=560176504
(Liu collected data chips that were attached to his clothes)

ID=560176505
After analyzing this data, they may be able to read their attack patterns.

ID=560176506
Thank you. From here onwards is my job.

ID=260177001
So - how many times can you tell?\nThe attribute can not be applied to technology! !

ID=260177002
Hilarious! I can not apply it to this world No ability! !

ID=260177003
Oh no! !\nYou said that even in the coalition you can not grasp the attributes yet!

ID=260177004
Ha! Have you known such a thing!\nIf you can use attributes, you can do it alone with such a rural life!

ID=260177005
I fully understand the feeling that I want to leave here.\nIt is not so!

ID=260177006
Okay, so do it quickly!

ID=260177007
Wait ... you should not be a boss ...!

ID=260177008
Ah ... you are ....\nlong time no see ....

ID=260177009
(I asked Eric what happened)

ID=260177010
No.\nIt is noisy to add a system where the group leader can add attributes to the bowling device.

ID=260177011
anything?\nIf you can add that system, you can dig deeper and somehow ....

ID=260177012
Huh ~.\nEven if such a thing is said, what kind of logic should be constructed\nEven though I do not know ....

ID=260177013
In other words, if you can make anything, you do not misunderstand me?

ID=260177014
If I make something revolutionary, I think I can get out of here ....

ID=260177015
Already ... quit.

ID=260177016
Hey! Eric!\nWhat sells oil!

ID=260177017
Such a time, you can make quickly!

ID=260177018
Just recently the guys ....\nWhen I was still doing ballistic at the scene, every day overtime, overnight, weekend work was commonplace!

ID=260177019
......

ID=260177020
Do not be shy.\nWell ~ It is the order of my boss, I can not do it not to ....

ID=260177021
Wonder ... Do you want to do it again ...?\nI'm sorry, but do you ask me a favor and ask?

ID=260177022
In order to proceed with the stupid command of the group leader,\nI need documentation of attributes.

ID=260177023
It is the story of the people of the Union, the most exciting attribute is the hatred attribute.

ID=260177024
So, you go to the last carnival with hatred attribute, will you bring the material and come back?\nAs much as the group leader likes the reward ....

ID=260177025
Is it reward? Hey!\nIf it is not decent material, it will not be free.

ID=260177026
... Did you hear it?\nThat means that if it is decent material it will prepare a reasonable reward.

ID=260177027
If you get the material, take it directly to the head of the group leader.

ID=260177028
Even if you look ah, it's pretty handy, so if you do not like it, it will get caught ....

ID=360177001
Oh my life is ~.

ID=360177002
It is the last carnival of hatred.\nYou made a mistake?

ID=460177001
... How cheap is it?

ID=460177002
... I hate it?

ID=460177003
Tits!\nLook at your feet!

ID=560177001
Wow ... Is this a data chip full of hatred attributes?

ID=560177002
... Is it true?\nI'm not a lot of policemen right?

ID=560177003
Looking like this, in the past I was pretty much a Ned Company and I was saying buuibai!

ID=560177004
But ... I was blown away in such a countryside owing to my weird misunderstanding.

ID=560177005
(Sean robbed the data chip and confirmed its contents)

ID=560177006
Wow ....\nIt is quite nice.

ID=560177007
Reward?\nOh ... I see.

ID=260177501
Take care ...!

ID=260177502
Union soldiers seem to have entered anomalous blanks with attributes while they are not!

ID=260177503
Rely on only the information that you brought back ....\nAfter all, the majority injured and came back.

ID=260177504
But I have not come back yet.

ID=260177505
I wonder if it is safe ...?

ID=260177506
I'm bad soon after coming back ... can not you go over again?

ID=260177507
Soldiers who have not come back may still be alive.\nHelp them?

ID=260177508
I know that it is serious ....\nBut I will not do anything like this, I can not put them down.

ID=260177509
They say they went to the healing last carnival.

ID=260177510
Without being too late ... hurry up!

ID=260177511
Please, thanks!

ID=360177501
Please ....\nEveryone is safe ... ....

ID=460177501
No more ... Nobody hurt ... ....

ID=560177501
Welcome back.\nHow was it? Safely ....

ID=560177502
Something about being alone ....\n... you did not make it in time?

ID=560177503
How lonely is she ....\nI wonder how hard it was ...?

ID=560177504
Sorry ... I did a strange thing ....\nThank you.

ID=560177505
Please be careful too.\nPlease.

ID=260178001
It is serious.\nThe citizens are bothering me with pain.

ID=260178002
Apparently the cause is in an abnormal space\nIt seems to have some attributes of pain.

ID=260178003
I thought that your move was stopped thanks to you.\nActually it seems to be moving little by little.

ID=260178004
Especially among the unusual blanks is the painful attribute that moves quickly.\nThe influence comes out to the citizens' body by this influence.

ID=260178005
Soul workers.\nI want to ask you again only. Stop that abnormal whitespace.

ID=260178006
Now head to the last carnival of distress and punish those who dominate it.

ID=260178007
We are aware of things that are not easy.\nBut there is only you who can cope with this.

ID=260178008
I'm begging you.

ID=360178001
While cooperating with you, I cooperate with Sunny and Warren to treat people.\nDo not be discouraged.

ID=460178001
It was a hard time. Soul workers.

ID=560178001
It seems that you could successfully carry out your duties.

ID=560178002
Those who had increased pain until a while ago are gradually stabilizing.

ID=560178003
However, it is not completely recovered.\nHow long will this state last? ... the future is thoughtful.

ID=560178004
I hope that you are there. Soul workers.

ID=260179001
Here, if you hide here, you're okay with attributes!\nI do not feel scared of this unusual white space!

ID=260179002
(Telling you that abnormal space is approaching Kandusity to Hiddinger)

ID=260179003
What! What?\nUntil like that! What?

ID=260179004
Damn it!\nHow can I do ... How can I survive! What?

ID=260179005
Hey, hey ...! Soul worker ... was it?\nWell then you are kind! What?

ID=260179006
Oh, listen to your request!\nIf it is a gentle person ... Oh, you will hear as much as you want! What?

ID=260179007
Well, I have to hide here ...!\nOtherwise, to that ....

ID=260179008
But, well! Considering the influence of the attribute, I can not hide anymore!\nPlease, erase the attribute immediately!

ID=260179009
That's right! What is the closest attribute from here?

ID=260179010
(Tell you that the attribute of the brightness is the closest)

ID=260179011
This ... Brilliance! What?

ID=260179012
Well then, it's a junk hive!\nStop it soon!

ID=360179001
Quickly ...!\nWell, it is over if that comes!

ID=460179001
Good!\nGet earning rewards and get away from here! Get away from me!

ID=460179002
(Hiddinger threw a reward)

ID=560179001
Here it is good already! What?\nDo not get close! Do not get close! Never!

ID=560179002
I will find it!

ID=560179003
(A little away from Hiddinger)

ID=560179004
Well, it is close by.\nBut ... you have no choice, can not you?

ID=560179005
All right! What?\nI will take a breath ....

ID=260179501
I'm sorry but ... One thing, can I ask you a favor?

ID=260179502
Thank you ....\nAaron 's condition is much worse after losing Katherine.

ID=260179503
At first I thought that was due to sorrow that lost Katherine ....\nIt seems that it is different.

ID=260179504
My complexion was also very bad, I thought that I was a serious illness, I told you to take examination.\nYou refuse it stubbornly.

ID=260179505
Leave it as it is, if there is something to do with Colonel Aaron ....\nI can not face Katherine ....\nSo, when Lieutenant Colonel Aaron was asleep, she inspected it secretly.

ID=260179506
Then ...\nA high numerical attribute gauge was detected from inside the body of Lieutenant Colonel Aaron ....

ID=260179507
According to what has been reported so far, if there is an attribute gauge of a certain value or more in the human body,\nWith various pain ... ....

ID=260179508
Eventually ....

ID=260179509
......

ID=260179510
die ....

ID=260179511
In haste, as a result of investigating based on various materials and information,\nLieutenant Colonel Aaron found out that it is addicted to malignant attributes!

ID=260179512
In order to neutralize its malicious attribute,\nThere is no way but to eject it to the outside with a reagent of evil ....

ID=260179513
In order to get the reagent of that malicious idea, enter an abnormal space of malicious attribute,\nIt seems that we can only get it directly.

ID=260179514
In our strength, absolutely can not enter the abnormal blank of the malicious attribute ....\nSo I would like to ask ....

ID=260179515
(I told Victor that I understood it)

ID=260179516
really! What?\nThank you!

ID=260179517
I want you to invade the junk hive of evil and get reagents of evil from that!

ID=360179501
I will treat you with all your power so that you will not lose power until you come back.\nI asked.

ID=460179501
... I'm sorry. It was trouble for you.

ID=560179501
Colonel!\nPlease drink this reagent! Otherwise, the symptoms are getting worse!

ID=560179502
It is already good Victor.\nI lived long enough.

ID=560179503
Let me finish my life quietly.

ID=560179504
It's soul worker.\nGetting this reagent ... Is it serious?

ID=560179505
Would you like to use it for patients suffering other than this old one?

ID=560179506
What are you saying! !\nIf you drink this you will heal!

ID=560179507
Please ...!\nAlso for Katherine ... Drink this reagent!

ID=560179508
Please stop it already.\nI have already decided.

ID=560179509
In any situation, you must not abandon hope.

ID=560179510
Ralph?

ID=560179511
Colonel Aaron, this is the word you said to people in this town.\nYet, such a ...

ID=560179512
Kets ... make you laugh.

ID=560179513
......

ID=560179514
In such a fucking world\nEven if you have one undecided husband like you\nI thought it was not bad, but ....

ID=560179515
... Apparently I also seemed to have gone.

ID=560179516
Were you in the end, was only a man of his own mouth?

ID=560179517
...! !\nWhat ... What! What?

ID=560179518
You say what you understand ....

ID=560179519
Ralph!\nstop it!

ID=560179520
Everyone of my family ... I passed away earlier than me.\nBut even so, I am alive like this!

ID=560179521
Why do you know that I live in greed like this fucking world?

ID=560179522
I love ... my precious family is ....\nThe place where I lived in this world ... to protect the proof that I was alive!

ID=560179523
And today I wanted them to live\nTo tell them that they are desperate to live now living!

ID=560179524
What has already lived long enough?\nI did not say anything funny! !

ID=560179525
Protect the place of memories that I spent with the people I loved! Develop!\nIt is our mission that it survives!

ID=560179526
Hey, Aaron!\nIf you die, you will die quickly.

ID=560179527
......

ID=560179528
......

ID=560179529
(Victor will remove his seat)

ID=560179530
......\nCatherine ....

ID=560179531
Daddy can not go there yet ....\nThis place is still not the world you dreamed of ....

ID=560179532
A little more ....

ID=560179533
Just a little more ... please wait in heaven.

ID=560179534
(Aaron drinks reagents silently)

ID=260180001
Are you doing your best?

ID=260180002
It was just right.\nI was in trouble because of lack of personnel.

ID=260180003
Rumors that Candus has attributes with attributes ... You have heard of it?

ID=260180004
I will definitely come back .... Why is it so ... here?

ID=260180005
If it is a soul worker, that blank ... can somehow do it?

ID=360180001
... What, is that hand?

ID=360180002
Okay!\nIf you ask asked, I'll have it prepared!

ID=360180003
Well then, I asked!

ID=460180001
Okho Ho.\nHow about reward at this level?

ID=460180002
Please say it is not enough.\nI'll give it a color if it is a little.

ID=560180001
Have you solved it?\nAfter all it is amazing! Soul workers!

ID=560180002
If anomalous whitespace with attributes does not come any closer, that's fine.

ID=560180003
Good job.

ID=260180501
Hey ~.\nSeoul workers there.

ID=260180502
Will not cooperate with my interview! What?

ID=260180503
Recently, what do you think is the thing that everyone is most concerned about?\nMake a guess.

ID=260180504
Catherine's innocent death?\nDebt Henry's escape?\nOr ... or.

ID=260180505
Cinsea-chan's bikini, a beautiful goddess Aphrodite's reincarnation?\nHehehe

ID=260180506
The third one is hot though.\nEverything is losing ~!

ID=260180507
The correct answer is the emergence of anomalous blanks with attributes and you are a soul worker!

ID=260180508
Still not complete information has been published!\nRecently what everyone is most concerned about!

ID=260180509
What kind of soul junk is in the abnormal whitespace with attributes?\nWhat is it like?\nWhat if the soulwalker fights against an abnormal blank soul junk with attributes?

ID=260180510
Hehehe\nHow? Did not you notice it soon?

ID=260180511
Everything on my request is easy.\nI want you to break into anomalous blanks and fight Seoul Junk with attributes!

ID=260180512
After interviewing it ... Uhufu.\nI will bash out an outrageous viewer rating!

ID=260180513
Care\nEven though I imagined it, it will be awesome ~ ♡ Do not you think so?

ID=260180514
Well, immediately\nShall I prepare for the interview?

ID=260180515
(Cynthia attached a small camera to the collar without consent)

ID=260180516
All right! Ready!\nWell ... then, where is going to go?

ID=260180517
Ah! hatred!\nYup! The hatred junk hive looks nice!

ID=260180518
Exclusive disclosure! Seoul workers challenge hatred places!

ID=260180519
How? This headline?

ID=260180520
Now! Go and hurry up ~.

ID=360180501
Ah! Just fight to see it properly, right?\nThanks

ID=460180501
Wow ~! ! I feel this special feeling Iba!\nThanks dear ♡

ID=560180501
Huh! What? Have you returned yet?

ID=560180502
It is truly a soul worker. It's just hot.

ID=560180503
Well then, can you return the camera?

ID=560180504
(Cynthia took the camera quickly)

ID=260181001
Ladies and gentlemen ... They are all busy due to their attributes ....

ID=260181002
Oh?\nAre you busy due to attributes as well?

ID=260181003
Huh\nHere too I have a lot of hands to grasp the attributes ....

ID=260181004
But, if you have information, you can make a strategy ....

ID=260181005
When I got lost, I thought about jumping into the abnormal whitespace of the attribute directly and trying to grasp it.

ID=260181006
Lieutenant Colonel Aaron has lost Katherine, so he can not afford to work at all.\nI am worried ....

ID=260181007
Moreover, since we intend to introduce large-scale troops to unusual blanks with attributes from the coalition in the future,\nIt is told me to set up a suitable strategy for that ....

ID=260181008
So, there is one strategy that came into this situation!\nAnd the point of the strategy is ....

ID=260181009
so! You are!

ID=260181010
Cooperate so that I can make a perfect strategy.

ID=260181011
It is easy to do.\nGo to the junk hive where you directly have attributes, and take the information there.

ID=260181012
that's all! How? Easy, right?

ID=260181013
You can do it if you have the ability of you.

ID=260181014
If there is something that can be obtained from the people who are there, please take it and bring it back.

ID=260181015
Well then, I asked.

ID=360181001
You will not fail, but I will think about another strategy just in case.

ID=460181001
Thank you.\nAfter all, my strategy is rocky.

ID=560181001
Is this so?\nWell ... It seems worth investigating.

ID=260181501
Are you okay?\nWhere does it hurt anywhere?

ID=260181502
Ah ... Soul worker.\nHe seems healthy and more than anything.

ID=260181503
Fuu, recent Candasity is not comparable with the past\nIt is a serious situation.

ID=260181504
Everyone was precisely in recovery work before,\nFrom one day that kind of spirit is gone.

ID=260181505
It will not happen in such a situation at an important time that we have to keep abreast of urban reconstruction.\nWhat is the cause ...?

ID=260181506
(Tell Robert about the unusual space)

ID=260181507
Yes ... unusual blank .... Because of that ...?\nTo penetrate even to the spirit and body of man ....

ID=260181508
What will become of the world?\nEven if another disaster comes again ...?

ID=260181509
If it comes to such a thing ....\nPeople are deprived of hope.

ID=260181510
It is necessary to avoid only that.\nSoul worker! Help me!

ID=360181501
It is because of that extraordinary blank that everyone is suffering from suffering!

ID=360181502
Please stop it so that abnormal whites do not come any closer!

ID=360181503
Please!

ID=460181501
thank you very much!

ID=560181501
Thank you for your hard work.

ID=560181502
A little while ago, it seems that people's motivation is gradually coming back.

ID=560181503
After all, it seems that that abnormal blank was the cause.

ID=560181504
I have to prepare also here so that this will not happen anymore.

ID=260182501
You said you were okay! What?

ID=260182502
I am afraid that I can not do it! !

ID=260182503
Because I do not like ...?

ID=260182504
It is the result of 1000 virtual battle in simulation!\n999 of them are defeated ... do not know why! What?

ID=260182505
It's just a simulation!\nIt is different from the actual one!

ID=260182506
Mammo ... it's gunko.\nHey! Maxim's!

ID=260182507
What ... What is it! What?\nDo not mess up!

ID=260182508
Hmm!\nAnyway it's definitely not good!

ID=260182509
Hey ranch!\nJust a soul worker is coming.\nAsk him!

ID=260182510
That's a good idea!

ID=260182511
Hey, soul worker.\nYou attribute went to blank space, did not you?

ID=260182512
How was the soul junk there?\nWas it strong? Were we weak?

ID=260182513
... I can not make myself understood by that explanation!\nCompletely ....

ID=260182514
How was it that you met Seoul Junk with a blank space?\nIt was tough or bad ... did not you notice anything?

ID=260182515
(It marks the barrel of the tank as Maxim thinks of it)

ID=260182516
This guy ... this guy ....

ID=260182517
Think of this tank's bombardment that you can damage Seoul junk with attribute blank space?

ID=260182518
Hey hey! run!\nHead to a story of an adult ....

ID=260182519
Please be a little silent!

ID=260182520
I tried more than 1000 simulations, but the result was 99.9% failed.\nI do not ask Mr. Maxim to send tank troops to attribute blank space.

ID=260182521
Altogether.\nAlthough I just end up being destroyed in vain where I went, I wonder why I am stuck so much.

ID=260182522
Ha ha! If you eat this bombardment of a tank, soul junk of attribute unusual blank!\nI swear to my mechanic career!

ID=260182523
Ah, ah ....\nHow about having a soul worker tell you exact data of attribute abnormal space?

ID=260182524
That's good, is not it?

ID=260182525
Well ... I guess it would be nice.

ID=260182526
heard?\nI am sorry, can I ask you this matter?

ID=260182527
Having an attribute of hatred ....

ID=260182528
It is not hatred!\nPlease go to the Bandit Highway with the attribute of brightness.

ID=360182501
If you bring accurate information, you will be convinced of the head bangs.

ID=360182502
Who is cheap!

ID=360182503
What is motivation?\nI do not say that I forgot the taste of the eagle's spanner! What?

ID=360182504
(... It looks like it will not end even if you wait.

ID=460182501
Gahaha!\nIt was a pain! Soul worker!

ID=560182501
How?\nDid you know the information about them?

ID=560182502
Now tell me!\nI will not let the old people wait!

ID=560182503
(Tell the information on the bright Bandit Highway in detail)

ID=560182504
Hmm, enter that data ... ....\nChange the numerical value ... How is it!

ID=560182505
(Results are displayed on simulation machine)

ID=560182506
Take ... 60% winning percentage ....

ID=560182507
Huh? 60%! What?\nA lie! Really? What Mr. Maxim says is right! What?

ID=560182508
Gahaha!\nGet it! The eagle's simulation is more accurate!

ID=560182509
My career on oiled coat is not Date!\nJust report to the commander and do not get permission to enter tanks.

ID=260183001
Ah! you are!\nlong time no see. Er ...

ID=260183002
Is it Seoul worker, is not it?\nHahaha. I've heard of your recent activity through the secretary.

ID=260183003
That's right, there is a wish for everything ....\nMay I have valuable time, please?

ID=260183004
Actually, do you know that there are abnormal spaces with attributes recently?\nWith considerable confidential information, well-known to people in the upper class ....

ID=260183005
(Talking about stopping moving attribute anomalies to Allen.)

ID=260183006
Oh! That was you!\nWell, it might be just right.

ID=260183007
To tell the truth, it is that every request.

ID=260183008
The abnormal whitespace with attributes is approaching Grace City here, it seems that it has done little damage at a time.

ID=260183009
Besides, the greatest damage to children in orphanages where Mr. Kacha works ....

ID=260183010
I also tried my best and I had the most famous doctor look at me ... but I could not do anything ....

ID=260183011
Because of that, pretty Kaja is shedding tears ....

ID=260183012
So keep the anomalous blanks with the approaching attributes as far as possible ....\nNo, I would like you to stop at least.

ID=260183013
Can you please?

ID=260183014
Ah! Do not worry if it is about reward.\nBecause I will prepare the corresponding thing.

ID=260183015
Even if I look like this, I have quite a lot of money.\nIt is impossible for ordinary people to imagine.

ID=260183016
Hahaha.\nIt is natural to be surprised.

ID=260183017
People tell me exactly what they are not based on their appearance.

ID=260183018
Oops, the story has diverted.\nOkay.

ID=360183001
People are suffering everyone.\nSo, if I can have a good relationship with Mr. Kacha, I will build a foundation looking after the orphans around the world.

ID=460183001
I will send the promise promise to the secretary.\nThis is just a feeling. Please accept it.

ID=560183001
From the upper part of the Union, I heard the information that you stopped the evil Bandit Highway.

ID=560183002
After all, it seems that my eyes did not go wrong.

ID=560183003
I ... I have confidence in the eyes to see such people.

ID=560183004
Hahaha.

ID=560183005
You can see Mr. Kacha's wonderful smile again.

ID=260183501
Fuwa ... I finally came.\nI was waiting ~ ~.

ID=260183502
It seems that the feeling is not good for the human body due to the influence of abnormal whitespace with attributes ~.

ID=260183503
Fua ~ Ah ... the poor thing is children, are not they ~.\nToll commander is also sick ~ ~.

ID=260183504
Um ... what is it?\nI am sacrificing this body for humanity ... Is it?

ID=260183505
Well ... even such a person is the commander of Grace City for the time being.\nIt is also the point that the father gag disappears.

ID=260183506
Take the reagent for Toll commander as well ~.

ID=260183507
I tried a little research though ....\nTall commander seems to have a calm poisoning ~.

ID=260183508
Fuwa - So go to the Bandit Highway with cool calm attributes,\nPlease pick a calm reagent.

ID=260183509
Well then ... I asked for it ~.

ID=260183510
Oh yeah ... I will attach a micro translator ~.\nI'm sure you will need it ~.

ID=360183501
Please deliver the reagents directly to Toll Commander ~.\nI will go to bed for a moment ... from ....

ID=460183501
(Tall says something)

ID=460183502
Then ... reagents ... more ...\nIt is delicious ...

ID=460183503
Is it delicious?

ID=460183504
banana…

ID=460183505
Bananas are ...\nlong ...\nThe long is ...

ID=460183506
(Get off quickly)

ID=560183501
Goh! Geohogeho! Gehoeho!\n[Translation machine: Yay! Is there something for me? ]

ID=560183502
Goho ... well ... ... Goho! Geojohogeho!\n[Translator: What? Reagents! To me such an expensive thing? ]

ID=560183503
Goho ... Goho! Geo Ho!\n[Translation machine: I heard rumors that it is a great effect! ]

ID=560183504
Goho ... Goho! Gehoe ho ... tsuzu!\n[Translator: But I am just a cold! Please use it for other people]

ID=560183505
Ho! GeohoGo is noisy!

ID=560183506
(Senior forcibly put the reagent into the mouth of Toll)

ID=560183507
Gaha ... hey! Geho Ho ...!\n[Translator: Wait ... wait! I ... I do not like medicine! ]

ID=560183508
Gokchu ...! Good ...!\n[Translation machine: I am swallowing something]

ID=560183509
Muu ... ... body ...! Oh!\n[Turn off translator]

ID=560183510
This ... I was surprised!

ID=560183511
It is not bitter!

ID=560183512
Oh! I thought that the medicine was bitter!\nIt was a wonderful discovery this year!

ID=260184001
noob! Do you train properly?\nApparently ... Muscles seem to be falling?

ID=260184002
In such a thing, do not fully demonstrate your abilities.

ID=260184003
Apparently, you seem to need my special training.\nAlright, I came up with one perfect training.

ID=260184004
Do you remember the hatred Bandit Highway out of the unusual blanks with attributes you cleared up?

ID=260184005
After that, I went to see the situation, they ... They were powered up extraordinarily with hatred for you.

ID=260184006
... It was nearly being destroyed by virtue of it.

ID=260184007
For you you will find the best place to learn.

ID=260184008
No way ... You are not afraid to go?

ID=260184009
what you doing.\nGo ahead quickly.

ID=360184001
Weak soul workers are not needed in this world.\nI will not let you run away right now.

ID=460184001
You seem to have a strong hand.\nWell done, I got a new entry.

ID=560184001
Did you go back?\nI went to other places and it probably did not kill time properly?

ID=560184002
Well ...\nIf I go directly, I can tell immediately whether it is a lie or not.

ID=560184003
But ... there is no need for that.

ID=260184501
Ha ha ha. The attribute is that the term is over soon ....\nFrom one to the next ....

ID=260184502
I guess Tall will do it well ....\nOld soldiers are worried.

ID=260184503
You are not an affiliation affiliate ....\nWould you mind asking us one as a person walking on the same path with us?

ID=260184504
I was promoting Tall to the Captain without fail and I was looking for ways to protect this Grace City.

ID=260184505
As one of them, the obstacles that are standing as walls in the future of Tall '\nRemoving in my era ....

ID=260184506
It's bad to go with an old soldier selfish ....\nCan not you control the healing Bandit Highway?

ID=260184507
If you do, Toll can also put emphasis on the safety of Grace City with confidence.

ID=260184508
I am a lifetime ... I beg you to do my best.

ID=360184501
If young people are for the future of the future, this old fashioned ... will be the cornerstone of it.

ID=460184501
It was a hard time.

ID=560184501
Did you go back safely?

ID=560184502
Just as expected ....\nRecent young people work early.

ID=560184503
In the future of Thor, you need someone like you.

ID=560184504
There may be more missing parts,\nThor ... I beg you to do my best.

ID=260185001
Oh news.\nhow are you?

ID=260185002
You are requested by the coalition.

ID=260185003
Thanks to you I could grasp the information about the attribute, but I still seem to be lacking information on pain.

ID=260185004
So, I want you to go to the Bandit Highway of distress and collect information.

ID=260185005
Originally these tasks are communicated from Thor commander ....

ID=260185006
Goho ... Gwahhon! Geojejo!\n[Interpreter: Did you call it? ]

ID=260185007
... Do not worry.\nAnyhow, it seems I have to proceed on this subject.

ID=260185008
How? it can?

ID=260185009
The content is simple.\nGoing to Bandit Highway of pain again.

ID=260185010
Data will be saved automatically.\nI will send the data upwards.

ID=260185011
Well then, thanks!

Gohogehwi! George ...!\n[Interpreter: Do not forget souvenirs! ]

ID=360185001
be careful.

ID=460185001
Tired, new.\nPlease take a good rest.

ID=560185001
Are you back already?\nAfter all young people are not different.

ID=560185002
You will get chips with data.\nIt is a chip made by Sedulin, so there should be no problem.

ID=560185003
Seduction! ! Goeh Geug!\n[Interpreter: Sedulin 's ...! What? Such data or such data ...! ]

ID=560185004
I will try not to speak permanently.

ID=260186001
Oh, I thought you were just calling me.

ID=260186002
Even here in Ruin Fortress, it seems that attribute abnormal whitespace is getting closer as with other areas.

ID=260186003
Thanks to you I was able to avoid the situation of immediate contact.\nBut, in the aftermath of the attribute, the influence comes out to the people here.

ID=260186004
Among them, Betty of the communication force is serious.

ID=260186005
Eczema appears all over my body and it gets hot.\nI do not have to inspect it. It is a rejection reaction in the body by the attribute.

ID=260186006
I am studying people with tolerance to attributes,\nI do not know if Betty will keep it until a new drug is developed.

ID=260186007
Of course, I can do medicine. But this is a fight against time.\nBetty ... there is a high possibility that I can not bear to do drugs.

ID=260186008
As a result of investigating, Seoul Junk in the brilliant Iron Castle,\nIt seems to have a healing component for the brilliance.

ID=260186009
I do not know the details of indications such as efficacy and ingredients ....\nThere is no time to say such a thing now. Betty's life is on.

ID=260186010
As a scientist, I feel my helplessness at such times.

ID=260186011
Soul workers.\nCan I ask you?

ID=260186012
I can not do anything on behalf of me ... Please help Betty.

ID=260186013
The situation will contend for one minute and one second.\nPlease pick up the reagent and give it to Betty in a hurry.

ID=360186001
Betty ... Please wait a while.

ID=460186001
... Thank you.\nThe power comes up.\nTo ....

ID=560186001
Wow! Kuu ... well, it still hurts.\nEven though there were many things I wanted to do ....

ID=560186002
(Remove reagent)

ID=560186003
Betty! Now, drink this reagent!

ID=560186004
Th-This is?\nAh ... analgesic ... is it?

ID=560186005
The efficacy of medicine is unknown in many parts, but Betty's symptoms should be relieved.\nWell, drink it soon.

ID=560186006
Wow, for me ...?\nI am happy ... Hehe.

ID=560186007
Betty.\nLet's keep the chatter around here. Well, early.

ID=560186008
Okay.\nEven if there should be emergency ... I will not hate Sarah.

ID=560186009
Betty!

ID=560186010
(Betty closes his eyes and takes medicine)

ID=560186011
Wow ... It's bitter.\nFuu ... I'm already taking a rest.

ID=560186012
No! Betty! Firmly!\nBetty's consciousness ...!

ID=560186013
(Betty's breathing stopped)

ID=560186014
Betty ...?\nNo! Firmly!

ID=560186015
(Gradually the blood returned to Betty)

ID=560186016
Huh

ID=560186017
Sa ... Mr. Sarah ....

ID=560186018
Betty!\nAre you ok? What?

ID=560186019
Yes ... I'll be fine.\nIt was a little, but I was dreaming a beautiful dream.

ID=560186020
What ... what are you talking about?\nYou ... my breathing has stopped.

ID=560186021
In my dream ... a cute child ....\nDo not come here.

ID=560186022
It is still early ....\nI said something else ... What was that ...?

ID=560186023
... children?\nThat ... what is a kid?

ID=560186024
Mom?\nPlease help me.

ID=560186025
Oh ... by the way ....\nThat child ... to Sarah ... I looked alike.

ID=560186026
Eye ... Also the color of hair ....

ID=560186027
That ... that kind of ...!

ID=560186028
(Ask if Sarah is perplexed)

ID=560186029
Nothing ... nothing.\nBetty ... Betty's physical condition is getting better, I will go back ....

ID=560186030
Betty.\nYou should not leave it yet.

ID=560186031
(I saw something like tears in Sara's eyes looking back ... Is it due to mind ...)

ID=560186032
Haa ... It got a little easier.\nThanks ... Seoul workers.

ID=560186033
Sarah ....\nWith a blank crack, I have a one daughter ....\nAmanda was saying that he died ....

ID=560186034
If that girl were alive, it would have been the same as me.\nSo sometimes ... Sarah ... I was watching for you with a warm eyes.

ID=560186035
That girl who came out in my dream ....\nI wonder who she was ...?

ID=260186501
Explore here too ... Explore that too ....\nWill it be possible to search for one of the chanches? ... To the exploration unit ....

ID=260186502
In such a case, you should apply for the transfer to another unit ....\nYup?

ID=260186503
Hey, it has not been long time ago.\nMy friend of mind.

ID=260186504
It is incomprehensible to pretend not to know ~.

ID=260186505
(It is troublesome if involved ... Let's go somewhere)

ID=260186506
Hey ... Hey! wait a moment!\nI have something for you. There is something important.

ID=260186507
Actually, from the Union there is a request to investigate the phenomenon of abnormal whitespace with attributes.

ID=260186508
Perhaps it is likely to put in large troops to anomalous blanks with attributes on the near day.

ID=260186509
So, I want to check the change of the abnormal blank situation.\nTo organize measures forces that can handle all situations.\nSo, it seems that we requested a search request from our exploration unit ....

ID=260186510
However ... due to the influence of abnormal whites having attributes derived simultaneously and frequently in various places,\nThe force of the exploration unit is almost destroyed ... ....

ID=260186511
But! I came up with a goodbye home run, reversing from this state! !

ID=260186512
That means ... That's you!\nHa ha ha!

ID=260186513
You check the abnormal space with attributes instead of us!

ID=260186514
What a wonderful thing! !\nThis is exactly ... a perfect harmony of Union and Seoul workers!

ID=260186515
Well then, will you let me hear your reply at the end of my story?

ID=260186516
Oops, I forgot one thing.\nIf you refuse, young people who are responsible for the purity of the Union's future will be sacrificed.

ID=260186517
Ha ha ha. The talk is over.\nI surely believe that you will go to the investigation of Iron Castle of evil.

ID=360186501
I have to prepare a report while you are exploring.\nReport preparation is also one of the important tasks of the exploration unit.

ID=460186501
Perfect.\nSay thanks.

ID=560186501
Was your adventure fun?

ID=560186502
I also wanted to have an adventure together.\nAs you know, I am in a position to make a plan ... ha ha ha.

ID=560186503
The information you brought back will surely serve you. Do not worry.

ID=260187001
Hello.\nDid you possibly go to an unusual white space with attributes?

ID=260187002
As expected!\nDid not the communication break down there?

ID=260187003
... Well, I can tell by looking at the face!\nFuu ... did not you do that?

ID=260187004
Well ... I ...\nWhat is going on ~!

ID=260187005
Haha ... Actually, communication with the soldiers who got into the abnormal whitespace with attributes has expired, and great damage has come out.

ID=260187006
Because the instructions of the troops are communicated, as soon as the battle broke the ranks were corrupted ... I was aimed at Seoul Junk there.

ID=260187007
So we were angry from the upper part.\n... But, I do not know that such a thing has been said!

ID=260187008
Oh, it's okay!\nI do not need to use honorific words for those who are strange.

ID=260187009
I'm fine if I just got mad ...\nThis time I told you to be able to communicate even in anomalous blanks.

ID=260187010
Completely ... it's easy to say!\nI ask you why!

ID=260187011
There seems to be Seoul Junk that disturbs communication, apparently when heard from an injured soldier.

ID=260187012
Even if he's done, you should be able to communicate.

ID=260187013
I have a favor to ask there, though.\nCan you do something?

ID=260187014
Was good! I am saved!\nI will prepare a report to hit the people in the upper part!

ID=260187015
... ....

ID=260187016
... Ah ... but ... it's a secret to those in the upper class.\nBecause I do not know you!

ID=360187001
Ho! I will not struggle if I can do it soon after being told to do it!\n... Oh, I did not tell you.

ID=360187002
I will prepare a report to hit the people in the upper part!

ID=460187001
Good job!

ID=560187001
You went, did not you?\nWell, let's see if I can communicate with this ... Do you want to try it?

ID=560187002
(Amanda activated the communication device)

ID=560187003
Jessie ... Jeezy ... Peep ...

ID=560187004
Soldier: "Jeezy ... Seriously! Amanda ... Jizzy ... Wow ... Jeezy ... I guess!"

ID=560187005
Soldier: "Jeezy ... Oh! Amanda ... Jeezy ... Seriously ... Jizzy ... Great!"

ID=560187006
Something ... I ... I'm being praised a lot!

ID=560187007
As expected the soldiers know!\nOkho Ho!

ID=560187008
(I think it is probably a different story ... let's keep it silent)

ID=260187501
Did you receive the communication of the Union?

ID=260187502
Oh? It sounds different ....

ID=260187503
No way ... since I wished for the famine,\nDid God listen to your request?

ID=260187504
Hehe.\nDo not cry. Was funny?

ID=260187505
If that is the case, can you help me a bit?\nIt's not such a difficult thing ... just asking for an attribute's anomalous blank?

ID=260187506
Anxiety of hatred I want you to retrieve the information of those who are in the blank.

ID=260187507
All right.\nIf you break into anomalous blanks of hatred and even knock down those who are there,\nBecause this device collects data automatically.

ID=260187508
Is not it? Easy, right?

ID=260187509
(Sarah attached a data tip to the collar)

ID=360187501
I wonder if I will study the principle of the universe.

ID=460187501
Tired.

ID=560187501
welcome home.\nHave you got data securely?

ID=260188001
Huh ~.\nHow do you say I intrude into the healing iron castle ... ....

ID=260188002
Ah ... you are ....\nActually, I entered Iron Castle of healing from the upper part and ordered to report the situation.

ID=260188003
But ... whatever you do not support, trying to invade alone ....\nIt is unreasonable for fluffy! I am not a soul worker ....

ID=260188004
This is for Seoul workers ....\nAh!

ID=260188005
that's right! You! !\nHahaha ~ Oh yeah! You were a soul worker, I forgot.

ID=260188006
It's a bit nasty request ....

ID=260188007
Will you break into Iron Castle of healing instead of me and bring home the information?\nOf course, I will also prepare rewards properly!\nUnion is! However, it is ~.

ID=260188008
I beg you to do my best ~.

ID=360188001
Haa ~ I am relieved that the soul workers are nearby ~.

ID=460188001
Thank you.\nI will ask you if an uncontrollable mission comes next time.

ID=560188001
eh! What? Have you already gone?

ID=560188002
As expected, there is no one who will come to your right if you do work quickly!

ID=260188501
(Ian seems to be communicating)

ID=260188502
Huh? spy?\nHey kola! How many times I told you!

ID=260188503
How long are you going to say what is spy!\nWell then why did you welcome me to the coalition!

ID=260188504
... What did you say?\nAre you a little silent?\nDo not be silly!

ID=260188505
Where I now feel bad!\nI do not speak directly, though ... damn!

ID=260188506
... Hello! Hey kola!\nOh ... honey! !

ID=260188507
(Ian puts the receiver gruesome)

ID=260188508
Damn it ... I will treat it like this forever.\nwhy ....

ID=260188509
Hmm? Is it a soul worker?

ID=260188510
What. Did you see it? Haha.\nWell, that's why.

ID=260188511
I heard that anomalous blank movements have stopped thanks to you,\nThere was something to worry about and I was investigating a lot.

ID=260188512
In my calculation, the abnormal whitespace of pain is getting little by little.

ID=260188513
I told I would go into iron painful Iron Castle directly to prove it.\nThen it seems that the great men still recognize me as a dangerous figure.

ID=260188514
Huh\nIf you leave iron painful Iron Castle this way, the influence of the attribute surely comes out.

ID=260188515
Because I was refused, will you go instead for me?

ID=260188516
It is a bit of a bone break, but I think that if you stumble the violent people with the painful Iron Castle, the movement will stop.

ID=360188501
Well then, I asked.

ID=460188501
I appreciate it.\nYou ought to be able to understand great masters.

ID=560188501
Oh, it seems that my expectations were right.\nThanks to that, the movement of painful Iron Castle has also stopped.

ID=560188502
You seem to have raised your heavy waist at last. Haha.

ID=260175001
I came.\nThe situation is a situation. You can get into the main subject at once.

ID=260175002
As you have already experienced, do you remember the last carnival, a trace of abnormal emptiness?

ID=260175003
Traces of abnormal blanks,\nApparently the last carnival was not the last one.

ID=260175004
It seems that a new dimensional gap has been created due to a blank crack.

ID=260175005
It's the same last carnival<fontcolor='#F29661'>attribute<fontcolor='#FFFFFF'>It is formed by a new substance.

ID=260175006
If the gaps in the dimensions created by the attributes appear through this blank crack to this world ....

ID=260175007
The world will have the worst situation.\nIt seems like the first time a blank crack appeared.

ID=260175008
Also, if you encounter a situation like that ... What do you think happens to humanity?

ID=260175009
According to data ....

ID=260175010
It is the destruction of mankind.

ID=260175011
There are currently 6 cracks confirmed.

ID=260175012
I can not grasp exactly, but as the crack approaches this world,\nThere are reports that people's liveliness is lost, and confirmation is taken.

ID=260175013
I myself do not get much better than before.

ID=260175014
You will be more resistant than normal due to the special power of soul worker.

ID=260175015
Still, as the crack approaches, the power will fall out.

ID=260175016
I understand that I am tired from the mission.\nHowever, it is impossible to overlook this. I would like to ask you.

ID=260175017
I ask you on behalf of all humanity ....

ID=260175018
I believe it.

ID=360175001
Some abnormality is seen from all blank cracks.

ID=360175002
I'm sorry but I can not guarantee myself in the current situation.

ID=360175003
... Somehow.\nSoul workers.

ID=460175001
Thank you.

ID=560175001
It seems that it was able to be solved successfully as it seemed.

ID=560175002
On behalf of this Locotown, say thank you. Thank you.

ID=560175003
....

ID=260178501
You came. I can not say that the condition is good here.

ID=260178502
Even though I'm just trying to have troublesome guys, it is unlikely that anomalous blanks will occur.

ID=260178503
Do you remember the abnormal space in Locotown?

ID=260178504
What kind of impression did you receive?

ID=260178505
You are the only one who has infiltrated an abnormal whitespace with attributes. That information becomes all.

ID=260178506
(Tell the block about anomalous spaces with attributes)

ID=260178507
Yes ... I also have confusing things ....

ID=260178508
In order to solve this problem, as with LocoTown, you have only to get into an abnormal space.

ID=260178509
I'm sorry, but I will have you attach this device to you this time.

ID=260178510
It's a device to investigate whitespace with attributes.

ID=260178511
I do not trust you, but you do not know the identity without more specific information, do you?

ID=260178512
(The block attaches the device to the collar)

ID=260178513
It's a chip made with micro-nanotip technology.\nHow? Is not it light?

ID=260178514
Well then, please.

ID=360178501
It may be serious, but I also want you to understand the circumstances here.

ID=360178502
I was too busy and the correspondence became sloppy. sorry.

ID=460178501
(Block removes data chip)

ID=460178502
Thank you.\nI will use this information carefully.

ID=560178501
... I'm pinning more than I expected.\nI was saved.

ID=260182001
I was waiting. I can not say that the situation is good here.

ID=260182002
It is no exception to come up with an empty space.\nFuu, how long will these troubles continue?

ID=260182003
Do you remember the abnormal whites in Kandas city?

ID=260182004
What kind of feeling was it?

ID=260182005
You are the only one who has infiltrated an abnormal whitespace with attributes.\nIn other words, that information is all.

ID=260182006
(Tell Senior what about abnormal whitespace with attributes)

ID=260182007
Wow ... what is going to be troublesome again ....

ID=260182008
In order to solve this, you can only enter anomalous blanks like Kandusity.

ID=260182009
Oh, new. This time please turn on this.

ID=260182010
It is a device made for efficient investigation with blanks with attributes.

ID=260182011
I do not trust you.\nHowever, we can not take measures if we do not have more detailed data, right?

ID=260182012
(Senia installs the device on the collar)

ID=260182013
Culmination of micro nano chip technology.\nYou do not get in the way, do you?

ID=260182014
Well then, I asked.

ID=360182001
You will always make a lot of hard work ....

ID=360182002
But it can not be helped.\nYou understand?

ID=460182001
(Senia removes the data chip)

ID=460182002
Good job.\nI will not waste this information.

ID=560182001
Looking at the safe place, it seems that it worked.\nI was saved.

ID=260185501
I heard rumors.\nDid you solve problems with attributes?

ID=260185502
Even so, it happens to cause unusual white spaces.\nI wonder how long this will last.

ID=260185503
Do you remember the abnormal whites in Kandas city?

ID=260185504
What was going on inside?

ID=260185505
Only you have invaded the abnormal whitespace with attributes. That information is everything.

ID=260185506
(Tell Sara about things about anomalous spaces with attributes)

ID=260185507
attribute ....\nAnother new phenomenon is happening ....

ID=260185508
In order to solve this, you can only enter anomalous blanks like Kandusity.

ID=260185509
I'm sorry but I wonder if you could turn on this device.

ID=260185510
It's a device to investigate whitespace with attributes.

ID=260185511
Information on attributes is still small. We need to gather as much information as possible and devise measures.

ID=260185512
(Sarah attaches the device to the collar)

ID=260185513
This is a chip made with micro nano chip technology.\nDoes not it disturb movement?

ID=260185514
Well then, thank you.

ID=360185501
It is here that the biggest damage this time.

ID=360185502
People are falling one after another.\nYou should be careful.

ID=460185501
(Sarah removes the data chip)

ID=460185502
Thank you.\nI will not waste this information.

ID=560185501
I like it safe and at all.\nRest well.

ID=260189001
How's it going lately?\nNewcomer soul worker.

ID=260189002
This time, how much is Jin's soul gauge with different abilities\nThere was a request from the coalition to grasp.

ID=260189003
I think it is a good opportunity for Jin-kun.\nYou can figure out how to fight by knowing your limits.

ID=260189004
Moreover! If you get it, it seems you can get a certain reward from the coalition?

ID=260189005
Well, start?

ID=260189006
Well, for the beginning ....\nCan you control over the powerful robots here in Ruin Fortress?

ID=260189007
How much does it matter?

ID=360189001
It is OK if you do not mind, you can abandon at any time.\nOf course, there is no reward! Hehuhu.

ID=460189001
Lost ~ ....\nOh ... a terrible soul gauge.\nThe data seems to be too huge and it takes a while to decipher it.

ID=560189001
Do not you? Did you want to quit?

ID=560189002
Huh? I had already finished?\nI thought it would cost me more ....

ID=560189003
After all, with pure soul workers and near soul workers,\nI wonder if it is totally different?

ID=260189501
Oh, Jin.\nFrom a little while ago, I was investigating an error during data decoding.\nNo way ... I guess the robot does not control everything, right?

ID=260189502
You said clearly, are not you? Let's control everything.\nThere are things to be careless even for soul workers.

ID=260189503
Absolutely ... give another chance.\nDo not worry, I will reward you properly.

ID=360189501
Do you control everything?\nBecause there is no next time?

ID=460189501
After all it is amazing.\nGood job.

ID=560189501
Oh! Have you already returned?\nReally, it's pretty early.

ID=560189502
I guess you misunderstood about Jin-kun.\nI'm sorry.

ID=560189503
Yes, it's a promise promise.

ID=15899001
Ah! %username%! I was looking for you!

ID=15899002
you know what! You can do anything with%username%, are not you?\n%username% can do anything, sister is saying!

ID=15899003
That's why I want you to ask Seska's request.

ID=15899004
I wonder what Setsuka wants to do ... I want to send a letter to Mom and Dad!

ID=15899005
Mom is in heaven and Dad is always busy and will not meet you, but I think she will surely read your letter!

ID=15899006
So, please deliver this letter to your dad and mum!\nIt's not so much mouthwatering, so%username% can do it, is not it? Is not it?

ID=55899001
Wow! After all%username%! That was exactly what sister says!

ID=55899002
Well then, Setsuka is waiting here!\nI have to deliver it to the sky properly in front of Setsuka!

ID=55899003
Huh? Why should I do it in front of Setsuka?\nBecause this letter is, because it is an important letter!

ID=55899004
Sethka watches her letter going to the sky properly!\nIt is absolutely impossible to send it where there is no Setsuka!

ID=55899005
Can you do%username%?\nBecause it is a promise! Surely!

ID=25899001
Reach it to Mom and Dad! all right?

ID=65899001
Hello. Mr.%username%, how are you?

ID=65899002
I ... I am depressed after the selfishness of Setsuka has started ....

ID=65899003
Do you know what I am talking about this time?\nYou are telling me to send a letter to Momma in Heaven in front of you?\nI'm going to heaven if I am not good!

ID=65899004
Although it is still young, it is about time for adults ....\nI stabbed a nail that I can not do, perhaps it may be unfaithful to say%username%.

ID=65899005
Huh? Have you already asked for it?\nHuh ... My head hurts.

ID=65899006
No matter how much%username% you can not send a letter to mom in heaven ....\nSorry for the inconvenience.

ID=65899007
......

ID=65899008
Well, maybe I can not go to heaven or something?

ID=65899009
Oh, ahahahaha! it's a joke!\nI think that Setsuka will weep and the stomach ....

ID=65899010
I thought it was quiet recently, what happened to you suddenly?

ID=65899011
Would you please stop Setsuka if it is fine?\nI think that child will never ask me what I say ... Please.

ID=95899001
Ah! %username%! Have you prepared yet?\nWell then, hurry! Deliver your letter!

ID=95899002
...? Can not?

ID=95899003
why ...? I can do it with%username% ....

ID=95899004
Do not do it! Send it! I ... I will ...

ID=95899005
Uooh ah! !

ID=95899006
Booe! Usotsuki! ! I told you to do it!

ID=95899007
I'm calling you for your birthday party! Both mom and dad, we all have Setsuka 's birthday party!

ID=95899008
Huh ... Higuri ... Huh?\nReally? Do you do it?

ID=95899009
... ... Because it's a promise ... Gusut. I have to send you a letter ...!

ID=95899010
Do not do it ... I cry more ....

ID=85899001
how was it? It seems that it did not work as it seemed ....

ID=85899002
Huh ... It is inevitable. Do you pretend yourself and write a reply?\nYou received a letter from Setsuka, are not you? May I ask you a question?

ID=85899003
I wonder what I wanted to tell you. I have a look at it.

ID=85899004
Um ... Mom, daddy ....\nthis ....

ID=85899005
I see ... That reminds me, was Sessuka 's birthday soon.

ID=85899006
Opening a birthday party on your birthday, you get a present ....

ID=85899007
But that girl, I do not need a present, so I'd like to see mom and dad ... I wrote it.

ID=85899008
my mother ....

ID=85899009
Mr%username% ....\nThat child, I have never done a birthday party ever.

ID=85899010
Since the world was in this state since I was born, I had no such room.\nMom died soon, and there was no papa ... even the time to celebrate your birthday was gone.

ID=85899011
But, someone asked me about my birthday.\nThat's why ... so much.

ID=85899012
... Well,%username%.

ID=85899013
I do not want to bother anything annoyingly ... I just want to associate Setsuka's selfishness only this time.

ID=85899014
Of course it is impossible to deliver letters to the mother of heaven or to the missing father.\nBesides, we have to send it before Setsuka's birthday ....

ID=85899015
Ah! Then how about pretending you sent it?

ID=85899016
Somehow, I will send a letter to the sky in front of Setsuka!\nThen Setsuka surely will be satisfied, will not you?

ID=85899017
Well ... but I fly to the sky ....\nwhat should I do ....

ID=85899018
That's it! PET bottle rocket!\nRecently I made school homework!

ID=85899019
How is it to launch a letter with this?

ID=85899020
... I know that PET bottle rockets do not fly so much.

ID=85899021
But, if you are%username%, do you know something?\n%username% can do anything. Jeje.

ID=85899022
Jeff ... he ....\nTo the extent that it is impossible asking for it.

ID=85899023
... Huh? Are you looking for a way?

ID=85899024
Thank you very much! I thought that it was absolutely bad ... after all it is%username%!

ID=85899025
Ah! Eric may know how to do something!\nIt seems to be a detailed feeling in such a place, is not it? Please listen to me for a moment!

ID=45899001
Yo,%username%! What happened? Do you need any help?

ID=45899002
Would you let the PET bottle rocket fly to the top of the cloud?

ID=45899003
The best record of PET bottle rocket was surely 600 meters.\nEven the lowest clouds, there are 2000 meters that is three times that.

ID=45899004
Well, it may be possible if you have professional equipment,\nSoree you have is just a plastic bottle.

ID=45899005
Impossible if you think with common sense ... but!\n%username% of the soul worker, is it possible for you?

ID=45899006
What should I do? Hey, you use "reinforcement" you are usually using.\nEven with just a stick it can be raised to the insane level by using the strengthening which can be transformed into the legendary holy sword, the output of the PET bottle rocket.

ID=45899007
Just recently, from the crow dream monster, I found a fuel material that could raise hydraulic output and a special tape that could withstand its output.\nIf you gather it and strengthen the PET bottle rocket, will not it be okay?

ID=45899008
I have a couple of hands, so I will do this for the time being. First of all, try reinforcing the PET bottle rocket.

ID=35899001
Trisha is supposed to do the remodeling of plastic bottle rocket.\nAlthough there is a slightly rough place, the ability is recognized by everyone. It surely does it well.

ID=35899002
As far as I saw a PET bottle rocket, it looks like I'm using a nice guy a bit ....\nWell, it's okay to try until you feel good.

ID=35899003
But if you can do anything you want to fly to the sky.\nAside from whether or not I can support you, I support you!

ID=260190001
(Amanda hits the communication device violently)

ID=260190002
Gang! Gang!\nAlready! I got cut off again ....

ID=260190003
Betty! How are you?\nGood vibes?

ID=260190004
Well ... not good.\nI wonder what's wrong ...?

ID=260190005
Did you wire properly?\nBecause it's a high equipment, you probably do not smoke, do you?

ID=260190006
It is terrible!\nI am not a thief cat!

ID=260190007
Well ... well, I've done it several times but ....\nI will not do it chudinely!

ID=260190008
Well then ... what's wrong?\nHave you noticed something?

ID=260190009
The communication line is connected properly ....\nCould it be because other troops cut out without knowing while moving?

ID=260190010
! !\nYou can have it enough ....

ID=260190011
(Amanda glares at Martin)

ID=260190012
... Amanda.\nOur exploration unit is a pro? Do you know that there is no such possibility?

ID=260190013
It is likely that people of the Star Forest Union misunderstand each other.\nI am burning with my job to advance with someone who is not smart even ....

ID=260190014
What ... What is it !?\nAt last it revealed the true nature?

ID=260190015
As expected, there is only a synonym of the best Kingdom of the Federation history of association?

ID=260190016
It is what you say. Physical Amanda chan.\nEven so, I do know that I know my past.

ID=260190017
No way ... Do you feel like me?\nOr, will you be attracted to attention?

ID=260190018
Oh, sorry.\nBecause you are the type I dislike the most!

ID=260190019
Even ~ Please do it!\nIt is not a time to argue now! !

ID=260190020
Funk! !

ID=260190021
Hoon! !

ID=260190022
Konoha ...! ! !

ID=260190023
Please stop it.\nIn front of the soul workers, the commander does not show such miserable attitude!

ID=260190024
Huh? Lie! What?\nSince when did you ... ... Possibly ... did you see them all?

ID=260190025
(Let me tell you a little)

ID=260190026
Temporarily calm down and listen to my story.\nI will explain why communication broke down.

ID=260190027
Oh, Dr. Sarah of the mind as expected. The reason has already been analyzed.\nI'd like to ask you for explanation so that someone else can understand it.

ID=260190028
What! What?

ID=260190029
Oh no! !\nIf you do not do it badly I'll blow it away! !

ID=260190030
(To be silent for a moment)

ID=260190031
Go ... Goghin!\nWell then, will you continue talking?

ID=260190032
Yes ....

ID=260190033
I'm sorry ...

ID=260190034
The reason is easy.

ID=260190035
That was because AI's Lucy, who kept Ruin Fortress here, was the cause.

ID=260190036
Lucy is certain ....\nWas not AI in front of Jessie?

ID=260190037
so.\nTo be precise, Jesse before AI was reset.\nIn other words, Lucy who was controlling on the Ned side.

ID=260190038
I recognized that Jessie was intruded from the outside and activated the communication disabled device.\nSo, even if we set up equipment, it was hacked and shut off.

ID=260190039
I am off the hacking AI through Lucy ....\nYou have to put this equipment on again.

ID=260190040
In that case, there is a perfect person.

ID=260190041
Ah ... I feel like I can tell who that is.\nI'm listening quite smartly.

ID=260190042
(Betty pierces his side)

ID=260190043
I told you about you ....\nYou should notice it soon, are not you?

ID=260190044
Soul worker! Please!\nGo to the cold revenge and start up all of our equipment there.

ID=360190001
I installed it in all areas of cold revenge, so start it all.

ID=460190001
Truly a soul worker!\nI'm counting on you ~.

ID=560190001
Welcome back.\nDid you start the whole device?

ID=560190002
Betty!\nTry the device, start it up.

ID=560190003
Yes.\nSwitch on! !

ID=560190004
(The machine sound sounded slightly, the communication device started up)

ID=560190005
Yay! !\nNo abnormality! Good operation! !

ID=260190501
Recognize soul workers.\nProcess activation.

ID=260190502
Good morning.\nA deska where you can put the mission in soul workers?

ID=260190503
AI from the beginning of I.\nCode name R - JS - 020 "Lucy" needs to solve the problem raised by the trout.

ID=260190504
Currently, the remnants of "Lucy" in the cold revenge are impatient and Imasu.

ID=260190505
Due to the error code, now all machines are changing to hostile mode.

ID=260190506
In order to change that mode, you need to get in the process, desga, the technique you do now is Nothing Death ....

ID=260190507
The reason is because I'm a dood mouth because of process error!

ID=260190508
DeSha! Soul gauge of soul worker should be able to clear by power.

ID=260190509
The worry that the machine will break is Muyoudez.\nAnyway AI can not change now.

ID=260190510
That is! Only the Butchkova has a way!\nRequest to the soul worker and mass.

ID=360190501
Hototogisu must be done when done.\nHuman 's Famous Death.

ID=460190501
Truly soul worker Death.

ID=460190502
Praise and tell the trout.

ID=560190501
Machines in hostile mode are all butchew-shaped, sitaka?

ID=260191001
that? Where is?\nI kept it in my pocket ....

ID=260191002
(Senson hurriedly searches for pockets)

ID=260191003
None ... not! Fuck! Even though it is an important document ...!\nWhere did you forget ...?

ID=260191004
Um ... where did I go ...?\nThe day before yesterday I stayed here all night at night shift ....

ID=260191005
Yesterday ... from the morning.\nAh! Cold revenge!

ID=260191006
Hmm? Soul worker! What?\nI was just looking for it!

ID=260191007
Actually ... important documents\nI've left it on a cold revenge ....

ID=260191008
What kind of document?\nHaha ... I can not say a bit ....

ID=260191009
I am planning to apply for the change of affiliation this time.\nI thought that my beloved lover made me feel lonely.

ID=260191010
I'm sorry to you but it was an unavoidable choice.\nIt is important to rebuild the world, but living is more important.

ID=260191011
Oh, that's not to quit right away.\nIf I calm down a little more, I feel like preparing for that.

ID=260191012
But, I lost the document.\nI am in trouble.

ID=260191013
It is difficult for me alone to go there unless you have the competence of you.

ID=260191014
Soul worker, I'm happy to bring that document.\nask.

ID=360191001
I want to use all the remaining time for those I love.

ID=460191001
Thank you.\nSoul workers.

ID=560191001
Oh! Were the documents safe?

ID=560191002
(Senseon looks through the papers)

ID=560191003
Well, it was good.\nI thought I was really gone.

ID=260191501
Aitata\nAlready! That machine!

ID=260191502
Ah! Soul worker! To a nice place!\nI'm sorry, but do you listen to me please?

ID=260191503
It is a bit of a Mazei situation ... There is no one who can only ask you.\nIs not it? Please!

ID=260191504
(I told you I understood)

ID=260191505
Hehe he is a soul worker.

ID=260191506
Actually ...\nBecause this is a super confidential matter, absolutely not telling anyone?\nGood?

ID=260191507
When they leave Ruin Fortress, Ned 's guys hid saved stocks somewhere.\nBesides, its war capital ... it seems to be a considerable amount!

ID=260191508
You can not hide such things in places you can easily find?\nTherefore, as a result of exploring the secret place using all kinds of communication networks ....

ID=260191509
... Please stop by a little closer! !\nApparently it seems to be hiding in a machine in a cold revenge.

ID=260191510
I went directly and tried to collect it ....\nThe resistance of the machine was tremendous, I did not bring it close.

ID=260191511
Thanks to the whole body ... Look at this scratch!\nBut, I will recover absolutely more than I found! !

ID=260191512
How?\nIf you would collect that warrant ... ....

ID=260191513
2 ... No! !\n30%! I will give it as a share!

ID=260191514
Is not it bad story, huh?\nWell, thank you!

ID=360191501
Huh ... ... huge war capital ....\nJust by imagining ... Yodare ... Jurut.

ID=460191501
I guess it's a failure again ....\nNo! to not give up! Next! Next!

ID=560191501
Welcome back!\nDid you find the war capital?

ID=560191502
(Tell the fact that no war money was found)

ID=560191503
Eh ... such ... I wish I could not do that ....\nI suppose it is absolutely right.

ID=560191504
! What?

ID=560191505
Possibly you!\nYou are deceiving me! What?

ID=560191506
......\nI will not be lying for that from the face ....\nSorry to doubt ....\nHuh

ID=260192001
(Martin talks to himself bossoboso)

ID=260192002
If it is a soul worker ... yeah.\nThere is a winning number ... I can go.

ID=260192003
Inui! ! Soul worker! ! Well, since when was there! What?\nWell, no way ... Is there the ability to cut off signs among the capabilities of soul workers?

ID=260192004
Fuu ... I thought the internal organs would pop out ....\nThat's it! There was something I just wanted to ask.

ID=260192005
Ha ha ha, do not refuse with your eyes! It's pointless!\nBesides, I have not said anything yet.

ID=260192006
The request is a request. Can I speak for the time being?\nKono ... That is not so important, but I want you to look around the cold revenge once.

ID=260192007
If it is a soul worker ... would it be a piece of cake?\nCan you show its ability, once?

ID=360192001
Do you want to beat it?\nThat was disappointing.

ID=460192001
Ha ha ha, thanks, I can make a profit.\nThank you.

ID=560192001
Oh well, soul workers are amazing.\nThis is an unexpected picking ....

ID=560192002
Ah ... sorry.\nActually, I'm betting with Amanda.

ID=560192003
Whether the soul worker can break through the cold revenge.\nIt's a small bet.

ID=560192004
Oh, of course I bet on souls soul workers coming home safely.\nI thank you for allowing me to make good use of my expectations.

ID=560192005
Thanks to that, my wallet seems to be moist.\nNuuff

ID=260192501
Hey! Soul worker!\nA little time now is it OK?

ID=260192502
Have you ever been to a cold revenge?\nDid not you see Enaq of Near Soul Workers there?

ID=260192503
(Telling you saw it)

ID=260192504
Really! What?\nThat yarrow! !\nFuu ....

ID=260192505
A few days ago, I asked for a pretty girl and asked me to strengthen my shoes.\nI received two of those shoes in reply.

ID=260192506
So, there are no gold or materials now, so tell me to strengthen with Tsuke.\nAh! At that time I doubted a little ....

ID=260192507
I thought somewhat suspicious ... but ....\nIt appeared dignifiedly in Ruin Fortress and I had to reinforce it because there was too much material.

ID=260192508
However, even if it took time to say that it would come for picking up,\nI thought that it was doubtful indeed, but my shoes have it, I thought it was okay.

ID=260192509
So when I tried to close the store, that yarrow ... I took the shoes aimed at that gap!\nOh ... when I remember I was stupid.

ID=260192510
So later I knew that this was Enearc of Near Soul Worker ....\nIt is a waste even though it is a surplus material ....

ID=260192511
Besides, as we strengthened our shoes, they were called by the Union's headquarters and heard the situation.

ID=260192512
That's why!\nThat near soul worker Enoch! !

ID=260192513
I hope you will not be able to do such a thing again!

ID=360192501
It is necessary to punish those bad habits like that!

ID=460192501
Thanks dear!\nHaa ~ It's refreshing with this!

ID=560192501
Oh! Welcome back!\nDid you make Enoch cool?

ID=560192502
(It seems better to say so something in the atmosphere ...)

ID=560192503
Ah ha ha!\nYou are a soul worker!

ID=260193001
Fuu, is Fogatton Armory the next ...?

ID=260193002
(An error message was displayed when Martin touched data equipment)

ID=260193003
Is it an error?\nHow many times ....

ID=260193004
(I felt that Martin was looking at me this way)

ID=260193005
Whew, I was in trouble.\nCCTV hacking equipment does not work.

ID=260193006
I wish soul workers were at such times.\nIf that great soul worker works CCTV hacking equipment.

ID=260193007
I'm sorry very much ....

ID=260193008
(It seems to me that you are going to go around and around ...)

ID=260193009
But I'm sure the soul workers are not busy because they are busy.\nI was in trouble. I wonder what to do.

ID=260193010
If you do not hack CCTV,\nThere is a fear that an innocent soldier is injured.

ID=260193011
(I will go because I do not want to hear any more ...)

ID=360193001
Oh.\nI hope Royal Soul Workers will lend my power.

ID=460193001
After all the soul workers are amazing!\nHmm ...? Oh, is not it ironic? Do not get me wrong.

ID=560193001
Mm? For what purpose is soul worker ...?\nHave you heard my own solve?

ID=560193002
Ha ha ha, that was rude.\nWell, I am interested in the upper body of Amanda separately ... I guess.

ID=560193003
! What?

ID=560193004
Kono ... Anyway!\nIf you have done it you can not help it.

ID=560193005
It seems that you responded firmly.

ID=260193501
Even so!\nHe was in Fogatton Armory!

ID=260193502
Huh ~.\nEven a truly nod it is impossible.

ID=260193503
I asked Jesse directly!\nYou really are there!

ID=260193504
This muscle stupid!\nJessie, the AI ​​is reset and the data is strange!

ID=260193505
Even ... ... as it was really ....\nSuch an expensive metal, the coalition will not let it go?

ID=260193506
That 's right ... but that' s right.\nHowever, it was said that it was really!

ID=260193507
Haa ~ Soul worker.\nWill you tell me something about this muscle stupid?

ID=260193508
(I heard what happened to Jite)

ID=260193509
That is the reason ....\nWhen the guys of Ned leave here, you know that you left everything as it is, right?

ID=260193510
That's what they used to put metal alloys used to make Fogatton Armory's robot.

ID=260193511
The metal is a good material, it is not readily available, it is a substitute that you can trade at a tremendous high price.\nSo I'm going to get the metal.

ID=260193512
It is impossible for us incompetent ordinary people like us ....\nIt is like going to throw out your life.

ID=260193513
......

ID=260193514
Taking a look at Jessie's story and doing something like that ...\nI am amazed and can not say anything.

ID=260193515
Soul workers.\nIf you do not mind, can not you go there and check if there is any metal?

ID=260193516
(Tell the JIT that you understood it)

ID=260193517
Ho! Thank you!\nWaiting for a good report!

ID=360193501
(Jight says something)

ID=360193502
With that expensive metal ....

ID=360193503
I need you.

ID=360193504
I can make it easy.

ID=460193501
Thank you very much, sorry to trouble you ....

ID=560193501
I've been waiting!\nSo ... did you have metal?

ID=560193502
(Tell you honestly that you did not have it)

ID=560193503
Ah ... sorry ... Is that so ...?

ID=260194001
Soul workers.\nIf you like time, how about a little story?

ID=260194002
Kohon, I do not know where to talk from ....\nActually, we are concurrently conducting other businesses other than storing goods.

ID=260194003
To put it a little more concretely,\nMoney lending business is in parallel.

ID=260194004
Instead of investing a fixed amount of money for people who are tied up with financial requirements, it is an act of obtaining a corresponding interest rate.

ID=260194005
I will explain it to avoid misunderstanding ....\nOur bank never creates a high interest above the interest rate.

ID=260194006
I am collecting these delinquent lists in parallel because I am concurrent with this money business ....

ID=260194007
Unfortunately, the situation occurred that the list of late arrivals that had been kept at the bank a while ago disappeared.

ID=260194008
Fortunately, because we have a tracking device in the box containing the overdue list, we were able to track it.

ID=260194009
However, I caught a signal from a ridiculous place.

ID=260194010
It is Fogatton Armory.

ID=260194011
Moreover, for some reason robots are said to attack with full power to protect the overdue list.

ID=260194012
Therefore, even at the Crow Dream Alliance Bank, big madness arises in the moneylending business.

ID=260194013
So, I was instructed by Seoul Worker to request cooperation.\nMaybe Seoul Worker, would you please bring me a list of overdue people?

ID=360194001
The operations of the Crow Dream Alliance Bank are paralyzed.\nI would be pleased if you respond as soon as possible.

ID=460194001
Thank you very much.\nWe are grateful from the bank side. Please receive.

ID=560194001
Oh, it's safe and what's more.\nI was worried that it was broken, but it seems safe.

ID=560194002
What is the difference in content ....

ID=560194003
(Odon confirms the overdue list)

ID=560194004
Martin is overdue for two years ....

ID=560194005
....

ID=560194006
Amanda delayed 2 years ....

ID=560194007
....

ID=560194008
Black list is ....\nThor is overdue for ten years ....

ID=560194009
....

ID=560194010
It seems there are no problems with the documents.

ID=260194501
Hey, soul worker.\nIt seems that rumors are entering and exiting Fogatton Armory, is it true?

ID=260194502
(Ian told it so)

ID=260194503
Oh! Was it true?\nWell then could you ask a moment?

ID=260194504
If you go to Fogatton Armory you may know.\nYou saw Heavy Fire Ruler and Deus Ex Makina there, did not you?

ID=260194505
It's about two of them,\nThere are things I have learned while advancing infrastructure development. It seems there was an interesting past.

ID=260194506
It is said that only two of them use a different version of AI than the existing aircraft.\nI wonder what he said ....

ID=260194507
Oh, I wonder if it was NeerAI-48.\nI do not know what kind of structure it is, but the association is also interested in that AI.

ID=260194508
Would you please check it if it is okay?

ID=260194509
... Why not?\nOh yeah.

ID=260194510
The reason is simple.\nAs you know well, I am not completely trusted by the coalition yet.

ID=260194511
In order to get trusted as soon as possible, I will do early action.\nWell then, I asked.

ID=360194501
We will not be able to proceed with infrastructure related work ....\nIt is a life that consumes hands at all.

ID=360194502
Fuu.

ID=460194501
Thanks!\nI'll let you use it for sure!

ID=560194501
How was it?\nWhat are the two states?

ID=560194502
(Ian taught information about Heavy Fire Ruler and Deus Ex Makina)

ID=560194503
Oh, he is interesting.\nThe Union is interested.

ID=560194504
Researchers will know more about me than me.\nI suppose I will do my utmost to create a faithful report.

ID=560194505
Thanks to that, it may be an opportunity to be trusted. Thanks!

ID=260195001
Oh no! !\nAbel's guy!

ID=260195002
Hey yomi ... calm down ....\nNobody thought Abel was such a guy ....

ID=260195003
I do not exploit from this ....\nI will find out and charge you for it!

ID=260195004
So ... let's settle down ....

ID=260195005
What a joy!\nBring me a weapon quickly!

ID=260195006
Bull ... weapons! What?\nNo way No ... Do you plan to go searching for Abel?

ID=260195007
Of course not!

ID=260195008
Even if you can, you can not let the price fall! Even after chasing to the end of hell, it is the creed of the merchant association to charge the price! What?

ID=260195009
I will definitely find out and charge you for it ... Uh! !

ID=260195010
Yomi ... I fully understand your feelings ....\nBut the partner is a near soul worker.\nYou know that you can not compete if you are not a soul worker class ... do you know that?

ID=260195011
That's why, if you leave it as it is, you will find something again! What?\nJite! If you do not want to come up with it separately! I will go alone!

ID=260195012
(Yomi put together the luggage ... let's stop before it gets cherished)

ID=260195013
Soul worker ... Please do not stop.\nThis is not just a problem for me! It is related to the honor of Merchant Association!

ID=260195014
(If you leave it as it is, really it is Masui. Let's cooperate)

ID=260195015
Huh?\nIs Seoul Worker helping you?

ID=260195016
Huh!\nYou ought to be busy ... Sorry!

ID=260195017
Thank you ....\nAnyway Abel would have exhausted all the items I took from me.

ID=260195018
I will not get any goods or price ....\nSo instead instead, please be sure to hold on to that Abel!

ID=260195019
If you do that, you should be able to keep the prestige of the Merchant Association anyway!\nPlease.

ID=360195001
Haa ... I thought it was how much damage ....\nIf I got it properly, I could have eaten fee .... Sexy ....

ID=460195001
Thank you very much.\nThanks and refreshed.

ID=560195001
Did you think enough to punish Abel?

ID=560195002
Hmm!\nNo matter how much soul workers, you can do it for me to step over from me for this!

ID=560195003
It is good!

ID=260195501
Hey, soul worker.\nYou know that Abel is a near soul worker?

ID=260195502
(I told you recently learned)

ID=260195503
Ah ~ after all.\nThat Abel was a near soul worker ....\nIs not it amazing?

ID=260195504
Felt in Abel, that ... a sense of affinity? Is it because it was like that?\nYup? Oh ... I heard from Abel that myself can also use powers like philosophy.

ID=260195505
I want to know Abel 's ability in detail.\nI'm sorry, could you explore Abel 's abilities for a long time?

ID=260195506
Well, it's just a matter of concern, so do not mind!

ID=260195507
......

ID=260195508
And then that I asked for such a thing ....\nI do not want anyone to tell me ... is it okay?

ID=360195501
If he has the same ability ....\nThere should be a way ....

ID=360195502
... Hmm?\nWhat ... was still there? To a great extent.

ID=460195501
Tits! Well ...\nThank you, soul worker.

ID=560195501
Oh? How was Abel's ability?\nLet me hear soon ~.

ID=560195502
(I taught Zenith about information on Abel)

ID=560195503
Well ... I see.\nIt is not the information I was looking for ....

ID=260196001
Hey, that's a newcomer.\nIf you have time, can you help me a bit?

ID=260196002
To tell the truth, I asked a soldier of the Alliance one thing.\nPlease have set up a visual activation device in Fogatton Armory ....

ID=260196003
Even so, they do not know whether muscles are made up to brain miso,\nI just left the hacking device there!

ID=260196004
Completely ... what are you thinking?\nHuh ~ ....

ID=260196005
So, once you go and rejuvenate your device and ask,\nI can not do it because I have to go elsewhere.

ID=260196006
Absolutely irresponsible people ....

ID=260196007
Well, it's bad, will not you activate that device instead?

ID=260196008
Please, thanks.

ID=360196001
Completely ....\nWhat do you think about that idea?

ID=460196001
Thanks dear.

ID=560196001
Did you do it?\nFuu ~ I am relieved with this.

ID=560196002
More ....\nThe more I thought about it, the worse I thought it was awful.

ID=560196003
How did you come up with the idea of ​​just leaving that device?

ID=560196004
I mean.\nNo, I do not understand.

ID=260196501
Fuu, I can not see the end.\nHmm? Soul workers? What happened?

ID=260196502
Oh, maybe I came to reduce my work?\nmy mother! Does not it sound like a joke? Seriously.

ID=260196503
It's a serious story ....\nWill you lend me your strength?

ID=260196504
This time the mission has come down from the Star Forest Alliance to patrol each region.\nAll areas belonging to Ruin Fortress here.

ID=260196505
As you know, Ruin Fortress has seven areas in all,\nDue to the limited time, it is difficult to patrol all.

ID=260196506
I'm sorry but can you just help me in a single place please help me?

ID=260196507
Yeah ... I'm sorry for a place that is too strong.

ID=260196508
Oh, that's right!\nWill it be okay with a deep core?

ID=260196509
Huh? busy?\nDo not worry, you can do it slowly.\nI do not need refrain.

ID=260196510
Well then, I'm begging you!

ID=360196501
All right!\nWell then shall we go.

ID=460196501
Was saved.\nNice to meet you.

ID=560196501
Wow, have you already gone?\nI thought it would take a little longer.

ID=260197002
That? Where have you been?\nI suppose I should have been caught between communication equipment ....

ID=260197003
Ah ... deep core ....\nI wonder if they dropped it over there ...?

ID=260197004
It is already the worst! I'm not twisted ...\nMore than that, it's a deep core ....

ID=260197005
Hmm? Soul workers?\nFor something ... Ah!

ID=260197006
Hey, it's bad, can you please ask me a favor?\nHuhuu ♪

ID=260197007
Do you know the magazine "Luxury Crow Dream" that was launched this time?

ID=260197008
(I answered that I do not know)

ID=260197009
Well! What? I do not know that they are so famous! What?\nWell ... well.\nAnyway, it's the hottest and most famous magazine in recent years!

ID=260197010
The appendix of that magazine is ... ~.\nThat clock of Aromani!

ID=260197011
Because of that, a lot of people are waiting long for their first issue to come out.\nIt's already premier.

ID=260197012
I also spent three days leaving for vacation ....\nI bought two books too! Fluffy ♪

ID=260197013
Nevertheless ....\nI have not had time to open an appendix, and have been brought back to the site right away.

ID=260197014
I sandwiched between communication equipment so that someone would not be stolen,\nApparently I seem to have dropped it with a deep core ....

ID=260197015
That's why I went to a deep core,\nCould you pick up that magazine?

ID=260197016
Please!\nWithout that ... I can not live anymore!

ID=360197001
Ah .... Have you been torn by magazines on robots?

Hehe\nThanks dear! Soul worker!

Ahh! ! !\nWow ... my magazine! !

New data?\nIn short, should I save it again?

ID=260197507
Squid\nGoodbye error and save as new data!

ID=260198001
Hey, did you see Noah at Deep Core?

ID=260198002
Huh ... Noah ....\nI'm sorry but could you please manage Noah?

ID=260198003
What's wrong?\nFu, a request came from the Star Forest Association to drive Noah out of the deep core.

ID=260198004
But,\nOh ... it's embarrassing to say such a thing ....

ID=260198005
Eh!\nActually ... I can not hit a woman!

ID=260198006
... ... haha ​​....

ID=260198007
Sorry.\nThe mighty warrior of a championship should not say such a thing.

ID=260198008
But it is impossible.

ID=260198009
Well,\nOf course you may be the same ....

ID=260198010
I'm really sorry ....\nWill you defeat Noah instead?

ID=360198001
No matter how I go, I can not do it.\nSorry, I beg you.

ID=460198001
Oh! Thank you!

ID=560198001
Did you really knock down Noah?

ID=560198002
Well, it was really good.\nI was wondering what to do if you could not do it.

ID=260198501
Hey, soul worker.\nDo you know the ghost zero in the deep core?

ID=260198502
Wow!\nJust thinking will not cause insects to run.

ID=260198503
Actually, I am a genius talent for other tasks ....\nThere is only one problem.

ID=260198504
That problem is ....\nI am not good at mollusks.

ID=260198505
Octopus, squid, snail etc ... etc.\nIt's a null nulling, there is no bone, Ueneune is moving and that shape ....

ID=260198506
Oh no ... no. It is a bastard if you think about this.

ID=260198507
Sorry, please destroy the ghost zero like an octopus in the deep core so as not to get into my eyes.

ID=260198508
I ... I asked for you ... Ooooo!

ID=360198501
Haa ... it should be perfect\nThere is no such weak point in this body ....

ID=460198501
A man named me,\nThere is no fault.\nYes, it is exactly perfect.

ID=560198501
Fuu.\nYou did it? It calms down.

ID=560198502
Such a weak figure can not be shown to lady.

ID=560198503
It was an unavoidable choice to leave my sharp image as a man in a freezing city.\nHa ha ha!

ID=260199001
(Senseon seems to be talking to Ian)

ID=260199002
Well,\nSo does that mean we can set it up over there?

ID=260199003
Oh, it should be possible as my view.\nHowever, it is my opinion. It is also difficult to get asked.

ID=260199004
If Ian says it would be a great benefit to the infrastructure system as well.\nBut is it really okay if I report it?

ID=260199005
As Ian says, if you operate normally, the two classes are likely to be able to promote.\nI wonder if I can make such a wonderful idea handmade.

ID=260199006
Do not mind there.\nMy name does not come out, but stability of the Star Forest Union is secured.

ID=260199007
Besides, I am not in a position to put such important matters into the meeting.\nIf you go well, treat me with a mess.\nmy mother!

ID=260199008
Well, I understand.\nWell then, we decide to modify only the name to yours and bring it to the meeting.\nPlease wait a moment.

ID=260199009
(Shengn changed the name of the case data from Ian to Sense)

ID=260199010
(After the data transfer, the decision document on the matter seems to come)

ID=260199011
Wow, have you got results?\nlet's see ....

ID=260199012
Haha ... I took months to suggest the case ....\nAs Sennon said after all it was early.

ID=260199013
(Both Ian and Sense went through the data with a bitter smile)

ID=260199014
As far as the contents are concerned, it does not matter if Ian's proceeding as it is.\nHowever, it is a problem that the person in charge goes directly.

ID=260199015
Then do not worry.\nIs not it? Soul workers.

ID=260199016
(Ian and Senseon will see this at the same time)

ID=260199017
I will progress the content I heard right now, can you lend me the power?

ID=260199018
In Akelon, you just start up the equipment for the infrastructure.\nEquipment is originally planning to hack and use the ned equipment there.

ID=260199019
It will be completed if it does it.\nI asked.

ID=260199020
Sorry. I ought to do it directly\nThere is a maintenance mission in another area ....\nI asked!

ID=360199001
Ian seems to be a really useful person.\nEven though she has her own abilities, she is said to have been excluded more than necessary.\nIt's frustrating.

ID=460199001
It was a pain.\nI was saved.

ID=560199001
Have you finished already?\nAfter all the soul workers are amazing.

ID=560199002
Ian.\nCan you proceed later?

ID=560199003
Oh, actually it's going on right after the startup confirmation.\nwait a moment.

ID=560199004
(Ian is operating the computer)

ID=560199005
All right! thumbs up!\nIt's a planned move.

ID=260199501
A little new!\nAre you occupied? Will you please listen if you are not busy?

ID=260199502
Have you ever been to Akeron?\nI'm currently preparing an article about Akeron, but a little problem has arisen.

ID=260199503
The main content of the paper is to predict the degree of development and future development of AI.\nThere is enough information in other areas thanks to you and the soldiers of the coalition.

ID=260199504
I can not grasp the AI ​​of the robot on the side of Akeron properly.\nBecause of that, it took me a while to create the paper ....

ID=260199505
I also have regular work ....\nIt is impossible to spend time forever in this paper.

ID=260199506
So, I'd like you to bring information on robots in Akeron.\nI will give you a reward properly, is not it?

ID=360199501
Oh ~ I am busy and busy.\nPapers, miscellaneous tasks .... I will not have been busy.

ID=460199501
let's see ....\nCircuit is here ....

ID=560199501
(Sarah is going to be very busy)

ID=560199502
Well! The next job is ....\nAh ... was it the operation of Spy AI circuit?

ID=560199503
Which ~? Red circuit is main power ....\nIs the blue circuit ...?\nAh! Operator transmission data must be modified!

ID=560199504
Operator transmission data is ... and so on.\nAttaches to the helmets of the soldiers ....\nAh! You are back?

ID=560199505
(Sarah continues talking without looking at his face)

ID=560199506
It's bad, but since Chloe has been automatically registered in the operating system,\nThat is why I do not have to report, as I confirm it.

ID=560199507
Good work ~.

ID=260200001
Ah! Soul worker!\nCan I have a minute?

ID=260200002
Um ... I have a favor to ask ....\nIs that okay?

ID=260200003
Actually ...\nI heard it from a acquaintance of the Ned Company side ....

ID=260200004
That ....\nWhen Ned leaves here, he seems to hide a lot of money.

ID=260200005
So ... I asked where the secret place was ....\nHe did not tell me at all and, once I paid the money, he taught me.

ID=260200006
anything ....\nI hid that big money in Akeron ... or.

ID=260200007
So, I would like Seoul Worker to bring back the money and come back!\nOf course, I will give you the appropriate compensation.

ID=260200008
how is it? You will be intrigued?\nHehuhu. Well then, thank you.

ID=360200001
Ned said he made a huge investment here.\nIn other words, there is no mistake that big money is sleeping!

ID=460200001
....\nOh ... Thank you.

ID=560200001
Wow ~ Need it! The scale is wrong, is not it?\nWell Okay, how much do you have?

ID=560200002
Then ... you can open it?\nopen!

ID=560200003
(When Yomi opened the box, iron scrap was in the heap in it)

ID=560200004
Wow ah! What ... what! What?\nWow! And it smells horrible! !

ID=560200005
That ... that kind of ....\nWas not it a lot of money ...?

ID=560200006
Well ... No way ....\nI was deceived ... I! What?

ID=560200007
It's a lie ... my Jenny! !\nI think I paid to get this information! ! Umeno! !

ID=560200008
Oh? What's wrong, Yomi?\nYup? What is this mountain of iron scrap?

ID=560200009
Umen ... I was deceived! !

ID=560200010
(I explained the circumstances to the jite so far)

ID=560200011
Wow!\nThis mountain of iron scraps ... do not soak in oil.

ID=560200012
Yup? You can wait ... Kore ....\nHey yomei!\nThis mountain of iron scraps, I will buy it!

ID=560200013
Sexy ... Why are you such a thing?\nYup? Or ... will you buy me?

ID=560200014
Ow!\nThis iron scrap ....\nI am immersed in contaminated iron scraps, but if refined it seems to be used again!

ID=560200015
Honestly ... really?\nBut Jight ... could I refine it?\nSo far, you should not have handled refining ....

ID=560200016
Ooh!\nI was doing secretly for a while!\nThese iron scraps are perfect for trying refining technology.

ID=560200017
O.K. I understand.\nThen, I will receive the Jenny amount I paid to get this.

ID=560200018
Ooooo! !\nSo, why do not you try changing this iron scrap to good equipment?

ID=560200019
(While muttering the smelly iron scraps, Jeight muttered somewhat)

ID=560200020
(Such damage ... It is better than seeing the sadness of Yomi!)

ID=260200501
What is Aquaron ...? Is it a soul worker?\nBy the way, have you ever entered Akeron?

ID=260200502
Well then, did you even meet Enoch there?\nHuh, nice.

ID=260200503
This is a secret,\nActually Enoch's popularity is high even inside the Starry Forest Union.

ID=260200504
That momentum is enough for Enoch 's fan club to do it?

ID=260200505
Hmm? Why do you know Enoch's fan club?\nActually, I am also a member of that fan club.\nmy mother!

ID=260200506
Every time I was treated unfairly in the Starry Forest Union, I saw Enoch's picture.\nI have a smile that made me lively for me.\nAh ... Enoch best.

ID=260200507
The fan club president is separate, but the information is not disclosed. But, perhaps the thought on Enoch should be hotter than anyone else.

ID=260200508
Enoch is an enemy for now, but if the ability of near soul worker goes away ....\nIt should surely be an idol that is unprecedented beyond Cynthia.

ID=260200509
Oh ... I wonder if you praised Enoch too much.\nHahaha.

ID=260200510
Anyway.\nAlso, if you go to Akeron, can you bring even the end of Enoch's clothes?

ID=260200511
No, I just like Enoch and it's not stalker! What?\nI just ... I just want to make friends with Enoch.

ID=260200512
Oh, can you also punish Gen Xsider X in the middle?

ID=260200513
my mother!\nActually, that's a mission, but it's covered with fan club gatherings!

ID=260200514
I do not want to miss it because it is the only opportunity to worship the fan club president.\nWell then I asked!

ID=360200501
Ay Enok is the best.\nI can meet Enoch a little more.

ID=460200501
Shit! Absolutely a secret?\nAbsolutely a secret to others!

ID=560200501
How was it?\nDid you meet Enoch?

ID=560200502
What about Enoch's belongings?\nIs not there anything?

ID=560200503
Huh\nI could have only a single hair.

ID=560200504
Is not it ginger?\nIs there anything I can do to make time and go to see me directly?

ID=260201001
... Damn it! !\nthis ...! Manuka!\nOtanconas! @ # $%! !

ID=260201002
(Martin is angry, let's ask why)

ID=260201003
Mu ... Soul worker.\nOh, do not mind.\nI'm sorry to give out loud.

ID=260201004
....

ID=260201005
Sorry. Can I cry a little more?

ID=260201006
... Damn it! !\nthis ...! Manuka!\nOtanconas! @ # $%! !

ID=260201007
(Let's ask again)

ID=260201008
Ha ha, it is quite persistent.\nIs it useless?

ID=260201009
Do you know about Enok in Akeron?\nMy head hurts because of that enoch.\nWhew.

ID=260201010
Enoch! Enoch!\nBecause that Enoch ....

ID=260201011
It is not unreasonable to shake all my ladies to shake my heart.\nHuh ... Damn it! Sorry! Women all over the world!

ID=260201012
Sorry my heart being deprived of enemies Enoch ... will you understand me?\nFuu, that I was no more than an ordinary man.

ID=260201013
My heart is determined to decide to leave the side of Enoch.\nA woman from the world should be waiting.

ID=260201014
Soul workers.\nWould you like to go to Akeron and say goodbye to Enoch?

ID=260201015
I have a desire to stay with Enoch ....\nThis can not be tolerated because of fate ....

ID=260201016
Because she might be sorrowful, I want you to say goodbye to goodbye.

ID=260201017
Oh, Enoch ....\nPlease do not hurt me.

ID=260201018
(I can not wipe the feeling that I was touched ... Let's get away from this place quickly)

ID=360201001
Enochu! Sorry!\nPlease forgive me like this!

ID=360201002
All the women of the world will be crying.

ID=460201001
Uhh ... Noah ... these days.\nHa ha! What? What ... nothing!\nHahaha ....

ID=560201001
Wow ...!\nGreeting to Enoch?

ID=560201002
I am a cold man. I have already got no pretenses for her because we parted.

ID=560201003
I, with the ice heart, the women of the world call "cool nice guy".\nHehe.

ID=560201004
(It seems Amanda is saying something in the distance)

ID=560201005
(I have never seen it when called) But

ID=260201501
Hey Soul worker.\nCan you change this communication for a while?\nFrom those who are looking for you.

ID=260201502
(When I raise the volume of the communication, I heard a nostalgic voice)

ID=260201503
Oh! It's soul worker!\nHow about life at Ruin Fortress?

ID=260201504
Grace City is like it seems that a "Pokkari" hole has opened in my heart, because there are no guardians.

ID=260201505
No way!\nAre not you guys also opening pocky holes?

ID=260201506
If so, this Tall will fill the open hole "Supori" ....

ID=260201507
It seems as if ... convex and concavity join together "perfectly" as if you are hooked ...!

ID=260201508
I will cut out the matter if it is only it?

ID=260201509
Hmm ... I do not understand this sublime gag ....\nSorrowful thing ....

ID=260201510
Soul workers.\nActually your request was made and contacted.

ID=260201511
There was an intelligence that Enok was planning something in Akeron.\nInformation from trusted people ... credibility is very high.

ID=260201512
However, it is also a fact that it is completely unreliable.\nSo you can not sacrifice soldiers in vain ....

ID=260201513
Therefore, if you are a skill of your soul worker, you decided that you can approach Enoch.

ID=260201514
Will you go to Akeron and check on what Enoch is going to do there?

ID=260201515
If you do not do anything, I will return home ... ___ ___ 0 Click here.

ID=260201516
(Sarah forcibly cut off communication)

ID=260201517
Not at all ... cold gags I will not be told many times ....\nWait, did you understand the content?

ID=360201501
(Something fax is coming)

ID=360201502
(Toll Commander: Sarah! What are you doing!\nTo sneak up off the superior gags of the superiors ... It's so strange!\nTherefore, I will hand down the penalty for dish-washing to yourself with this fax! )

ID=360201503
(Sarah broke Thor's fax into bilibrio and threw it away)

ID=460201501
Please do not communicate with Toll commander as I will transfer.\nGo away from goose bumps.

ID=560201501
Welcome back.\nHow was it? Because I did not do anything, did you come back?

ID=560201502
Ha ha! The cold gag of Tall commander has moved ....\nOh ... a sense of my life ....

ID=260202001
Good evening Good morning.

ID=260202002
I want to ask Seoul Worker.

ID=260202003
Currently, the control of the AI ​​of the machine that exists in the arcship is the breakthrough limit of the death.\nI tried to try it through internal software, desga ... so the wholesaler can not be lifted.

ID=260202004
Running software Niha, problem due to having to access with the approach admin ID.

ID=260202005
To fix the problem Nika, you need to communicate directly with Nak directly.\nIn other words, I have to go straight to the arcsip to beat me.

ID=260202006
I'm Imas here if Soulworker accesses the hardware here, so that I can proceed in a blink of an eye sooner.

ID=360202001
Massachusetts on rice balls.

ID=460202001
Great death!

ID=560202001
Thank you trout!\nIt is mission success.

ID=260202501
(Trisha grabs clothes suddenly and pulls it)

ID=260202502
A good soul worker! What?\nI will answer honestly the question I am going from now.

ID=260202503
You are ... is it true that you went to the arc ship?\nReally true! What?

ID=260202504
(I still told my clothes were pulled, but I went)

ID=260202505
Wow! It was true!\nFinally ... I finally met someone who went to the arc ship!

ID=260202506
That! Inside the arc ship ....\nHow did it go?\nStructure and ... ... Please do not tell me anything!

ID=260202507
(I remembered that Trisha was pulling clothes and let go of my hands)

ID=260202508
Oh ... I'm sorry ....\nI'm ... I get extreme when excited ....

ID=260202509
Arc Ship would have seen you, but it is a collection of great technical skills!\nIf you can go inside and grasp only the structure ....

ID=260202510
Even though it is a treasure trove of scientific civilization that can obtain considerable information ....\nBecause of the Union, it is still dangerous for us to ban people from entering and leaving.

ID=260202511
It's bad, but if you can not remember, will you go back and carry the information in the arcship and come back?\nI will prepare plenty of rewards!

ID=360202501
Then I asked for it!

ID=460202501
Good night! Well then will we start studying?\nKuuuuu! ! I'm excited for the first time in a while! !

ID=560202501
Did you really see the whole arc - ship?\nIt seems that the data is bad ....

ID=560202502
Hahaha! Thank you so much!

ID=260203001
Soul workers.\nIf you do not mind, I will talk a little.

ID=260203002
(Answering Audon's request)

ID=260203003
Thank you very much.\nThere was something I wanted to ask a little, and I got a voice.

ID=260203004
Would you please describe what we will tell you from now on without saying anything else.\nBecause it is an important content related to credit ....

ID=260203005
Where should we speak from?\n... I will tell you the truth from the beginning.

ID=260203006
Actually ... Apart from the Crow Dream Alliance bank to which I belong ....\nI am doing personal jobs concurrently.

ID=260203007
... But it's a simple job, though.\nProceed on behalf of customer's request ... ....

ID=260203008
Oh, it is not such a thing as to harm another company separately!\nOr getting things that are difficult to obtain ... like that.

ID=260203009
Requests came in as usual this time as well.

ID=260203010
(When asked who the customer is to Odon, it seemed to be upset)

ID=260203011
Ah ... sorry.\nBecause of the nature of the work, I can not disclose personal information.

ID=260203012
I am pleased if you can understand.\nI think that we will let the contents of the customer face down.

ID=260203013
....\nEven if you keep talking?

ID=260203014
As I mentioned earlier ... ....\nI invaded the arcship at customer's request,\nThe robot there was tough, I could not do anything.

ID=260203015
I tried to withdraw from the spot because I judged it was impossible any more.\nI was attacked by something.

ID=260203016
After a while I regained consciousness, everything I had was stolen.\nIf it was anything else it was good.

ID=260203017
I lost the bank guard certificate issued from the Crow Dream Alliance Bank.\nI just wanted to find out whatever it was, so I decided to ask Seoul Worker.

ID=360203001
Huh? Is it what I was looking for?\nHaha ... It's embarrassing thing to tell someone ....

ID=460203001
thank you very much.

ID=560203001
After all, the skill of Seoul workers is wonderful.

ID=560203002
Such a near ... Ha! Nothing ... nothing.\nRobots should have been strong, but it is safe and what is more!

ID=560203003
So, I have another purpose so ....

ID=260203501
Mr. Oh Senseon.\nDo you want to bring this strategy together?

ID=260203502
Is ... Yes!\nWell, that's ...!

ID=260203503
If you have Senseon who is the brave man of reversal, he is reassuring.\nIt is far easier to care for communication devices than the task I've done so far.

ID=260203504
(Amanda sees this)

ID=260203505
Oh? It's not a soul worker.\nJust right, I was looking for ~.

ID=260203506
(Huh ...! Amanda is gentle unlike usual!)

ID=260203507
Yup? What do you look like a pigeon gun has?\nOkay, will you come over here a bit?

ID=260203508
(Nothing ... I have a bad feeling!

ID=260203509
Uhufu. The reason I was looking for you is Kantan.\nIn collaboration with Mr. Senseon this time, I decided to fix broken communication equipment in the arcship ~.

ID=260203510
Well, the robot in Arc Ship seems to be strong, is not it?\nIs there even a near soul worker?\nYeah, it's hard.

ID=260203511
But, since there is a strong Senseon, relief ~.\nIs not it? Mr. Senseon?

ID=260203512
Is ... Yes!\nThat's right!

ID=260203513
Oh ~ awesome power ~ cool ~.\nBut ~ I wonder how I can get to such a distant place ~?

ID=260203514
There is a robot for movement\nIt is okay if you ride it!

ID=260203515
Yeah ~?\nWell then, how are Mr. Senseon and Seoul workers going?\nDo I have to go ahead alone?

ID=260203516
...!\nOh, the robot will ride the soul worker!

ID=260203517
Yup? What are you talking about ~.\nThat's not it ~ For now, let's have the soul worker go to the arc ship first ~\nMeanwhile, how about we are doing research?

ID=260203518
Is ... Yes!\nThat's right!

ID=260203519
No!\nLet's do so!

ID=360203501
Huh.\nI am nervous for some reason while I am watching Amanda.

ID=360203502
What? What?\nWould you like me to eat?

ID=360203503
Hit! I ... nothing!

ID=460203501
Fuu ... and anyway\nThank you.

ID=560203501
Oh, come on.\nHmm? Amanda? Huh

ID=560203502
He said he would go get the repair equipment and came out.\nHuh, you saw that?

ID=560203503
It is said that there are aliases such as "ruthless devil" or "communication witch".\nWhy do you change the voice tone when I get close.

ID=560203504
Maybe to me ....

ID=560203505
Are you trying to give punishment ...?\nAhh ....

ID=260204001
Soul workers.\nThere is a task I have to cooperate with you this time.

ID=260204002
Why do not you check it directly because you are in another place ....\nIt was content to grasp the important base of arcship where Zion is.

ID=260204003
I ... Because it's impossible to fight, I will go around your support.\nSo, I would like you to go to the arc ship.

ID=260204004
I will control the AI ​​that will interfere with you here.\nWell then, please.

ID=360204001
do not worry.\nI'll lead you properly, so I'm comfortable.

ID=460204001
... It was bad, forget it.

ID=560204001
Oh ... busy busy ....\nYup? What's wrong? What's wrong?

ID=560204002
... Ah! That's right.\nDid we cooperate with the strategy in progress?\nHaha ... I carelessly ... I do not care.

ID=560204003
But it seems that I could afford to be back at all.\nThen, is that OK with that?

ID=260204501
Huh ... this is Sion! ! !\nHey! Soul worker! Help me for a moment!

ID=260204502
Union soldiers inside arcship with reconnaissance and communication assistance\nHe installed a mobile power device.

ID=260204503
However.\nSuddenly Zion appeared, absorbed all the power of the device!

ID=260204504
Union soldiers who were there were also in Zion ....\nI could not resist anything.

ID=260204505
I ... I'm not strong at all ....\nI want to mourn even the soul of the soldiers who were sacrificed!

ID=260204506
Soul worker!\nWill you lend me the power?

ID=360204501
If I have the power ....

ID=360204502
...!

ID=460204501
Sorry ... everyone.

ID=560204501
Welcome back.\nWhile you were gone I went to a place where war deads sleep.

ID=560204502
Even if the world is confused, this sky will not change ....

ID=101252
Do you like xenocoin exchange?

ID=101250
Nice to meet you, no matter what!\nIf you fill in the coin, a good gift!\nI have to give it ... Of course I will not give it up! Borrowing glue! !

ID=16028001
Long time no see,%username%.

ID=16028002
Can you see the gluttons full of the town?\nRecently the appearance rate of glutton suddenly rises.

ID=16028003
Guruton picks up and eats it, then changes that substance into new materials in the belly\nDo you know that?\nMost of it will be converted to valuable substances and if you catch it will spit out that substance\nAs opposed to here it was a profit ....

ID=16028004
The story is different this time.

ID=16028005
No matter how much it's guts, dozens or hundreds of glutons will flock and eat up\nMaterials are running short. But that's too many to catch everything.

ID=16028006
Speaking as a soul worker, it would be difficult to catch all the gluttons that would disappear in all directions.\nBut there is no way out there.

ID=16028007
Go to their headquarters and refuse the original.

ID=16028008
Because of the blanks, because the world in which glutton lives is connected with this world\nIt is assumed that the gluten has soared so far.\nAlthough it is still in the hypothetical stage, it seems that the remarks that support it are appearing in the sixth area.

ID=16028009
Hopefully not only solve this problem,\nYou got even the treasure they've saved, two birds with one stone ... It may be one stone five birds.\nCan you investigate?

ID=56028001
Sorry, I thought you would do it.\nIt will be hard, but I will do the corresponding reward.\nI'm counting on you.

ID=56028002
First of all, it seems better to follow the rumor related to this case.\nGo to the sixth area. The golden eyes are supposed to sniff the rumors.

ID=26028001
Go to the sixth area. The golden eyes are supposed to sniff the rumors.

ID=66028001
Oh! Is this not%username%?\nLong time no see!

ID=66028002
Is it a deal? So now if you have a product ....\nWatts ...? That's not it? No way ... It's not about glutton, right?

ID=66028003
Is that so .... Let's make the voice volume small.\nBecause of that rumor, we are all excited now.

ID=66028004
Why you ask? That rumor is a rumor about the space where glutton is a mini-men.\nSo there are a lot of people investigating trying to get big money, it is already a big fuss.

ID=66028005
Me is not interested in get the big money, but glutton has a bit of a grudge ~ is not it ~.\nRecently I got caught up and I ran out of inventory in the warehouse.

ID=66028006
If you can cooperate with me, please provide information that Me knows ~.

ID=66028007
Do you do it? Thank you! Me is Vesi - because there was not a person who was quite capable of helping ~.\nI will not forget this kindness ~!

ID=66028008
This is information obtained because it is Me! Others are useless ~ ~?

ID=66028009
I know that gluton always carries light balls ~ ~?\nActually ... That 's a role of a key that you can freely move to the world of you.

ID=66028010
If that light ball is turned towards the direction of the guy's god ... ... the ball shines and the warp gate opens.

ID=66028011
bat! The problem here is that you do not know in which direction the guys' world is\nIt is how to get light balls!\nAs for these problems, if you do well arbitrarily, you will be believing.

ID=66028012
I gave information that I can get big money, so please resolve the problem firmly ~?

ID=96028001
Hello,%username%.\nAre you still using a helicopter today?

ID=96028002
Recently helicopters are increasingly being used.\nWell the majority are those who believe in the rumors of Gurton world.

ID=96028003
Can you see a small glow over the sky?\nThere seems to be a Gurton world there, and people are wanting to go there.

ID=96028004
It seems that he misunderstands the helicopter as a rocket or something. If you think common sense, you know what you can not go over there ... Fu.

ID=96028005
Huh? Thank you for the good information? I ... any information ...?\nThe place of Gurton 's world? Oh, you do not know.

ID=96028006
Thank you ... Please continue using helicopters.\nRecently your wallets are stiff and it is in trouble.

ID=96028007
The helicopter is slow ...?\nIs not that ... Humans exist faster than helicopters?

ID=46028001
Hmm ... Did you come back after all? Did you have any clues?

ID=46028002
How to use the gold light ball and the location of the world where the gluton lives.\nIt seems that you gathered enough information.

ID=46028003
But without Konami ball of the essence nothing will start ....\n... I wish I had something to do.

ID=46028004
Mm ... wait?\nPlease wait here for a while.

ID=46028005
(Ryu got a piece of yellow light from somewhere)

ID=46028006
It is a fragment that Guruton left.\nI kept aside if I could use it for something.

ID=46028007
Never ... because of money etc.\nDo not say strange things.

ID=46028008
Well, then ... this.

ID=46028009
(Ryu applied the adhesive to each piece and created the shape of a sphere)

ID=46028010
OK, let's see if there is a reaction.\nIf you are informed, turn this towards Gurton 's world ....

ID=46028011
(The golden spherical body gradually increases the light)

ID=46028012
It seems to be effective.\nMum ... but do not break soon. What should I do ....

ID=46028013
It is roughly made this. If you go through the process firmly, a decent response will come out.

ID=46028014
You ought to take this piece and adhesive to Zenith.\nShe is dexterous, surely it will do fine.

ID=36028001
Remember to collect the debris and prepare it at Zenith.\nYou should be willing to prepare if you can prepare the adhesive and cost to attach the debris.

ID=36028002
The adhesive ... I see.\nIt seems that yogi from miscellaneous goods stores are selling. You can get as much as you have money.

ID=15901002
Actually, I also fainted and collapsed ...

ID=15901004
Sorry ... Sorry ... really nothing ...

ID=15901005
... No, if you do not know it can not be helped.\nIt was bad to press it.

ID=15901006
I am sorry ...\nEven though I had to be firm until the end.

ID=15901009
do not know. Even if I keep tracking if I understand it.\nSo how's Sarah sighing?

ID=15901010
Do not ask me.\nIt is serious that an accident happens all over the world now.

ID=15901011
...? Is there another problem occurring?

ID=15951002
It seems that Miriam is coming at the dispatch of Fortune troops.\nIt seemed to be busy in assembling a medical tent, how about going to see him?

ID=56081002
There is nothing wrong with you.\nIf you have something against me, that is unavoidable. I do not feel like hating you.

ID=56081003
Today was a pain.\nYou ought to do the things you should do without worrying about me.

ID=15953002
It seems that Miriam is coming at the dispatch of Fortune troops.\nIt seemed to be busy in assembling a medical tent, how about going to see him?

ID=15955002
It seems that Miriam is coming at the dispatch of Fortune troops.\nIt seemed to be busy in assembling a medical tent, how about going to see him?

It seems that Miriam is coming at the dispatch of Fortune troops.\nIt seemed to be busy in assembling a medical tent, how about going to see him?

ID=15901012
After the woman of Zion and gold armor disappeared, abnormal phenomena occurred suddenly throughout Crow Dream.\nI agree with the opinion that it prevented the destruction of the world, but now it is a bad situation.

ID=15901014
We just followed the order of the upper part.\n... But there is plenty of possibility to bear the responsibility.

ID=15901015
Haha ... I'm used to being touched with responsibility.\nIn the worst case, I will tell the members of the research team not to discipline.\nAlthough accusations are inevitable, they will not lose their workplace.

ID=15901016
It will be saved ... It will be a big problem if you lose the laboratory.

ID=15901017
Um ... Is not there anything I can do to help you?

ID=15901018
In place of me I want to lower my head in front of a great man ... I want to say,\nTo ask such a thing for Seoul workers is a waste of talented talent.

ID=15901019
Dig Digs who ramped up to raise Zion also completely stopped functioning,\nThe reaction of a mysterious woman who appeared suddenly disappeared with the near soul worker.

ID=15901020
Unlike other areas, this place is quiet as never as before and no problems have arisen.\nIn this situation it is said that we are asking%username% from ....

ID=15901021
So what about the survey?\nHow to find a near soul worker ...

ID=15901022
We are in a difficult situation.\nI will try hard so that the hardships so far will not become bubbles, but I can not move until I can find some clues.

ID=15901023
It is a suspicious place whether direct clues will come out in the current situation.

ID=15901024
Is that so ...

ID=15901025
... Do not get too depressed.\nIf you live in that situation and you can come back, it is good.

ID=15901026
Still ... it is a fact that I could not do anything ...

ID=15901027
I know Sion, but nobody was able to anticipate that a woman who would retreat it in an instant would appear.\nNo one blames%username%.

ID=15901028
But, I ...\n...... No, thank you.

ID=15901029
Well, there seems to be a willingness to work. Since we will start another investigation from now on,\nCan you ask Amanda for a story once%username%?

ID=15901030
I was running around here with a rough appearance from a little while ago.\nPerhaps it got something important. Go and ask.

ID=55901001
Yes! Well then, we both go!

ID=55901002
I am sorry to have asked such a thing.\nI am also busy writing a report to excuse my great men.

ID=25901001
Please go to Dr. Sarah and Amanda. There may be some clues.

ID=65901001
Hello Amanda!

ID=65901002
You came back well. You seem to have been bullied by someone, but do not bother.\nThe most important thing is that%username% has returned safely.

ID=65901003
Haha ... Thank you.\nOh, I'm busy I'm sorry, but would you please tell me if something is happening?

ID=65901004
Well, which one should I speak from ...\nTo put it briefly, the world is fussing now. It is serious that requests for assistance come from everywhere.

ID=65901005
All over the world ... No way, who is dead?

ID=65901006
No, there is no talk of a person being dead just by panicking with the emergence of new blanks.\nYou do not have to worry.

ID=65901007
Just ... It is certain that abnormal whites appearing all over the world since Zion 's reaction ceased to be active.\nReally, it is an unexpected situation.

ID=65901008
Is that so ...\nWell, if you proceed with the survey of abnormal blanks, you can see how the near soul workers became.

ID=65901009
... I understand the feeling, but now is not the time to worry about those people?

ID=65901010
Yes ... I know.

ID=65901011
I understand ... It is not a face. Anyway, this is what I can say.\nIf you have something else you want to know, you might as well ask Dr. Sarah.

ID=95901001
Did you hear the news that anomalous space appeared from Amanda?

ID=95901002
Yes if in a dangerous situation ...

ID=95901003
Well, there are cases in the past that blanks are opened all at once,\nIt has been hardly active recently, but it was not rare a couple of years ago.

ID=95901004
But the nature of the blank confirmed this time is different.\nSo now, in the Star Forest Union we are investigating the blank by calling it "ideal blank".

ID=95901005
Nature ... What is different?

ID=95901006
I can freely go in and out.

ID=95901007
Common blanks suck humans inside and there is no way to escape?\nAnd there are side effects that people who come out of the blanks lose their memory.

ID=95901008
That freely comes in and out of the anomalous empty spaces that have emerged this time.\nIt can be said that it is not a white hole and a black hole but a gate or a passage connecting here and a blank inside.

ID=95901009
Thanks to you, the Starry Forest Alliance is currently fussing inside.\nIt seems that we may be able to finish the disaster of 15 years this time, and organize a dedicated team to investigate abnormal blanks at once.

ID=95901010
Is there a near soul worker too?

ID=95901011
I am not sure, but probably not.\nThere is no report that abnormal whites occurred around here, so it will not be sucked in.

ID=95901012
......

ID=95901013
What are you going to do?\nAre you going to search for the near soul worker who disappeared here for a long time, or are going to investigate abnormal empty space?

ID=95901014
I ... I am worried about where the near soul worker is.

ID=95901015
Hehe, I thought he would say so.\nThen stay with Ruin Fortress and stay with me ...

ID=95901016
Sorry, it looks like you can not stay here.

ID=95901017
Er ... Why?

ID=95901018
No way, another task was given ...?

ID=95901019
I also heard about a while ago, but the majority of the searching forces here are scheduled to be organized into abnormal blank entry troops.

ID=95901020
Probably, Near soul worker tracking is judged to be unsuccessful and it will be to give a new job.\nHahahaha, after all the great people seem to be accustomed to using excess personnel.

ID=95901022
... Do I have to go absolutely?

ID=95901023
I am not going to go too.\nIt is sort of like going all the way to go killing to go scouting in a blank space that you do not know what will happen.

ID=95901024
I am fine in the research field, but this person is absolutely obedient to the order.

ID=95901025
If you know something about the near soul worker, let's get in touch right away.\nHowever, do not you think it is more meaningful to proceed with the investigation of whitespace, which is the root cause of everything now?

ID=95901026
Well ... I rarely put it in the blanks.

ID=95901027
Thank you for your cooperation.\nHow about Dr. Sarah together? Is the space itself the energy that Dr. Sarah studies?

ID=95901028
Of course it looks interesting, but I'm interested in the energy hidden here.\nBesides, unlike Amanda, you are incompetent.

ID=95901029
all right. It is impossible to forcibly take the ordinary people who do not want to go to drift.

ID=95901030
Let us suppose that we will go to work.\nIt seems that abnormal blank space is near Rocotown, so it is confluent on site.

ID=45901001
Oh,%username%! Long time no see, eh!

ID=45901002
Haha ... well how was it?

ID=45901003
That's my line. It seems that it was seriously tough ... I was really worried.

ID=45901004
I ... I will always ...

ID=35901001
Ha ... I do not know if it's okay or bad ...

ID=35901002
my mother ...

ID=15911001
Anyway, it was just right timing. It is a big fuss during Locotown due to the recently generated blank.

ID=15911002
Can you see that blank floating in the sky of Locotown?\nIt is an order of magnitude larger than neighboring blanks.

ID=15911003
Certainly ... I thought that it was big from the front.

ID=15911004
Recently, the phenomenal blanks have just started to revitalize suddenly.\nNot only that, it seems possible to enter and leave freely according to the research team's report.

ID=15911005
Thanks to everyone in Rocotown evacuating urgently ...\nOn the contrary, E.S. P, a fortified person unit of the Star Forest Alliance, is gathered at Locotown.

ID=15911006
I really can get in and out ...\nOh, maybe people who are in the blank can also help?

ID=15911007
I do not know yet ...\nWe are going to investigate from now on by the disabled people of the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=15911008
Is that so ...

ID=15911009
Fortune troops are not ready yet, so I plan to go back later,\nWhat do you do with%username%? Perhaps, I do not think anyone forced the investigation ...

ID=55911001
I am going to go ... because blanks are certainly all causes of disaster.

ID=55911002
I do not know why there was a sudden free space to enter and exit,\nIf you go now, you may be able to help those inside!

ID=55911003
No ... I do not know what will happen in that?

ID=55911004
... ... Yes.

ID=55911005
Hehe, it does not change anyway.\nBecause I felt like a side of justice too, I thought that might be a thing.

ID=55911006
Haha ... Because it's such a world. I have the power to fight. I have to work hard ...

ID=55911008
I do not know that they are being treated unfairly, but fighting until the very end ...\n... With no doubt ...

ID=55911009
......?

ID=55911010
No, I do not care because it is a solitary.

ID=55911011
I do not know what's inside of it, so be careful.\nWe forget Fortune troops as soon as preparation is completed.

ID=55911012
Yes! Pardon me, I have to go now!

ID=25911001
I will follow you as soon as preparation is completed. Do not push yourself too much, do you? What?

ID=65911001
You came, I'm glad.

ID=65911002
Oh, Martin! You are here.

ID=65911003
Ah. As I said before, I assumed a blank investigation officer.

ID=65911004
Of course, we will continue to manage the survey team in Ruin Fortress, so it will come and go both places.\nPerhaps when%username% comes to Ruin Fortress, I guess I'll be there, too.

ID=65911005
Following the survey of near soul workers until the blank investigation ...\nMartin is so effective he is young!

ID=65911006
Hahaha, there are various competences. For example, the ability to perform disgusting instructions of incompetent superiors in two responses.

ID=65911007
Well, it's useless just saying a bitches. Let's share the current situation for the moment.\n... I am just coming now, I just asked a lot of people.

ID=65911008
Yes, please!

ID=65911009
There is nothing but a name.\nFrom now on I call this a glass cover camp.

ID=65911010
A glass cover ... a lawn covered camp ...?\nAlthough it does not suit this scenery for a moment, it seems to be a warm name.

ID=65911011
If you go into that place, tell the proposing person.\nI'm just explaining the story that I heard.

ID=65911012
Oh, I'm sorry ... I did not plan to do that ...

ID=65911013
No, I did not mean to say anything.\nEverything comes into here, everything is shocking, it seems he was preoccupied.

ID=65911014
Yes, is that so? ... By the way, have you found people sucked into the blanks?

ID=65911015
Oh, that's the story ... you might as well not have much hope.\nThere were few people around this area that we first invaded.

ID=65911016
Almost ... is not it? There was only one person.\nIt is ambiguous whether it is also a person or not.

ID=65911017
Ambiguous ...

ID=65911018
It might be better to check directly ....\nThere is a man who deceives the name of a human who died five years ago.

ID=65911019
The person who died ...\nIs not it a ghost, maybe ...?

ID=65911020
I can not say that there is no possibility ...\nAt least it does not seem to hurt ourselves, and we do not need to be frightened either.

ID=65911021
In the first place,%username% who has defeated a number of enemies is not afraid of ghosts?

ID=65911022
If the monster is knocked down with a sword it is over, but you can not do anything about ghosts ...\nGhosts are absolutely scared ...!

ID=65911023
ah I see.\n... I can say such things with a casual face You are scary.

ID=65911024
Anyway, this is about what I can share ...\nIn the meantime, tremendous support is being provided from the Star Forest Alliance for unprecedented blank investigation.

ID=65911025
I have brought more than half of the troops of ESP, an interlude force unit.\nThe good man decided to finish all disasters on the ground with this blank investigation.

ID=65911026
Different ability unit ... It is amazing.

ID=65911027
Wow is amazing, but in reality it is not enough for the power of one soul worker.

ID=65911028
... Hahaha ... I am not such a wonderful person ...

ID=65911029
Again, humbly so ...\nIf you underestimate yourself too much, you will lose self-esteem too!

ID=65911030
For the time being, I was left to do a ridiculous job of directing a different force unit.\nFortunately thanks to the kindness of all the different people, no trouble has happened.

ID=65911031
Only Amanda hated with this from the time of Ruin will not speak properly. Hahaha.

ID=65911032
Well, Amanda is here as well?

ID=65911033
I forcefully pulled saying I do not want to come.\nIf I do not see the beautiful body of Amanda, motivation does not occur.

ID=65911034
... Martin.

ID=65911035
Because it is a joke, do not look at me with such a thing.\nBecause communication is important if you go into a different space. I brought some talented people with certainty.

ID=65911036
I am incompetent, but only the eyes that see the person are certain.\nBelieve me.

ID=65911037
Yes yes, I understand ...

ID=65911038
Anyway, it is true that we are aiming at the expectations of upper part.\nSoul workers come to the mission of investigating abnormal blanks and are really saved.

ID=65911039
As promised by Ruin, I will tell you information on near soul workers as soon as they can be confirmed.\nMaybe it may be found here.

ID=65911040
Yes, thank you.

ID=65911041
That is over from me.\nThere is no energy of Amanda who had been brought by force, so do not hesitate to try out a voice.

ID=95911001
Huh

ID=95911002
That seems not to be good, am ... Amanda ...

ID=95911003
If someone is pleased with my situation now my brain is broken, or my hobbies are pain.

ID=95911005
I think humans are consumables.\nI am measuring the limits of my patience.

ID=95911006
It's serious, is not it?

ID=95911007
I will do things that is good at personnel evaluation, if I do not have words, I will quit instantly and live quietly in the corner of the room.\nI do not think I'm too competent ...

ID=95911008
But compared to the work of%username% ....\nIt was not a thing to say in front of a person fighting on the job at the work place, I am sorry.

ID=95911009
Such\nOf course, it is a fact that it is hard work, but how about trying thinking that Amanda is also helping people?

ID=95911010
I knew ...%username% is the same.\nI am not in a position to say honestly to other people, but both soul workers and experts are too good.

ID=95911011
By the way did you try talking to someone over there?\nAccording to the story it seems that he was in the blank.

ID=95911012
Oh, I heard the story.\nShe seems to be deceiving the name of the deceased person five years ago ...

ID=95911013
That's right, the strongest soul worker, Teneburis, who appeared suddenly ten years ago and bounced back the strength of Vesi ...\nI do not know if he is himself or not, but if it is true it should be a great strength in the Starry Forest Alliance.

ID=95911014
The strongest, soul worker ...

ID=95911015
Oh, by the way it seems I know%username%, but have you talked before?

ID=95911016
Huh ...? Do you know about me?

ID=95911017
You do not know%username%.

ID=95911018
There is no remembrance at all ... Because all the blank memories have been forgotten, it may be a person he met at that time.

ID=95911019
Then I want you to talk to me once. I am busy and I do not have time to talk.

ID=45911001
Hello!

ID=45911002
......

ID=45911003
It is called%username%! It was a doctor-appointed student ... It is a soul worker!\nThank you!

ID=45911004
......

ID=45911005
Ah ... that ...

ID=45911006
What happened ... ...

ID=45911007
Eh ... I'm sorry, I can not hear well ... Can I ask you again ...?

ID=35911001
Irwin Arkwright is asking where he is.

ID=15921001
Irwin ...? Who are you talking about? To me well ...

ID=15921002
Please do not be blurred! You who had been acting at his nearest will not be aware!

ID=15921003
I do not know what people are losing among people, but please disappear from here right now!\nThis place is not the place where you are.

ID=15921004
Ah ... U ... suddenly, what is it ...? Did I do something ...?

ID=15921005
Ah ...! Perhaps you did something rude while you did not know ...?\nI do not know, but I apologize if I misunderstood ...

ID=15921006
......

ID=15921007
Uoo ... I'm sorry ...

ID=15921008
Are you truly%username%?

ID=15921009
Er ... Oh! Yes! That's right!\nDid you get misunderstood by someone else?

ID=15921010
Mu ... I heard that I lost my memory, I thought that maybe personality may have changed ...

ID=15921011
Memory ... Yes.\nI seem to have been in the blank for 15 years ... I do not have any memory in the meantime ...

ID=15921012
... I do not look like a lie or acting.

ID=15921013
%username% I know is completely different ...\nEyes and talking way ... to the atmosphere.

ID=15921014
I am sorry to say a tough person, even though I was the first person to meet.\nI hope the crack does not exist in the future relationship.

ID=15921015
Oh, no! There is such a world and everyone is alert. I do not mind ...

ID=15921016
Thank you very much.\nMy name is Teneburis. It is such a form now, but once used as a soul worker of justice.

ID=15921017
After all, it is Tenebris.\nI heard that he died five years ago ...

ID=15921018
Oh, that is someone else ... No, it's "Teneburis\

ID=15921019
Huh ...? What does that mean ...

ID=15921020
Does user%% know the existence of soul spirit in the human body?\nIt is a phenomenon that the will of a person separates from the body, but in many cases it is common for children to appear.

ID=15921021
Seoul Spirit ... Ah! I do not have any details, but there was a small child who appeared when I wanted power ...\nIs it that child?

ID=15921022
A small child that appears when you desire power. ... Probably not, no doubt.\nThe soul spirit often appears depending on the desires and desires of people.

ID=15921023
It will be easy to understand if you have seen it.\nI became that soul spirit you know, it is a thing separated from the main body.

ID=15921024
It makes people soul spirit ... Is there such a thing?

ID=15921025
Yes. My body was discharged out of the blank by some people ten years ago and went back over there.\nOnly my intention to have to help people in the blanks remained here as a soul spirit.

ID=15921026
Because of that, it seems that it can not interfere with some substance.\nIt stands on the ground, but it will pass through even if you touch something.

ID=15921027
Haha ... It sounds like a ghost ...\nThat ... not a real ghost ... ...?

ID=15921028
It can not be said that it is different.\nI heard that my body in reality seems to have died five years ago and I may be like a lying spirit that remained here.

ID=15921029
Um ... ... Do not curse it or do not you ...?

ID=15921030
of course.\nBecause there is no grudge against%username% here now.

ID=15921031
Yes, that is ... I'm glad ...\nEven if it is a ghost, it is okay if the story can be communicated ... Hahaha ...

ID=15921032
... Is that so.

ID=15921033
Oh, that's right ...\nDo you remember that Tenebris was blank?

ID=15921034
Because I never got out of here, naturally I will not lose my memory.

ID=15921035
That ... ... Could you tell me what happened in the blank?\nThen, where is the sucked in?

ID=15921036
......

ID=15921037
I'm sorry, I can not do that.

ID=15921038
Er ... Why ...?

ID=15921039
There is a reason, I can not say it.\n... Now I can only say that.

ID=55921001
Perhaps ... Do you have something to do with what I told you when I first met?

ID=55921002
... I can not deny it.

ID=55921003
You certainly have lost memory.\nBut I still could not see if you really changed.

ID=55921004
If you give it to me straightforwardly, I can not completely trust%username%.

ID=55921005
I can not trust ... I am fighting for everyone from the bottom of my heart ...

ID=55921006
I heard from Mr. Martin enough about the story about you,\nI also understand that many lives have been saved thanks to you.

ID=55921007
But people have conveniences for each.\nNow I would appreciate it if you understand me who can not convey any words.

ID=55921008
... understood. Well then, what should I do to gain trust?

ID=55921009
I will just watch over your work here.\nIf you judge that you are a trustworthy person ... I'll tell you all that time.

ID=55921010
Okay ... Then we will help people as usual!

ID=25921001
... I suppose I will never meet again.

ID=65921001
Oh, you came to a nice place. We were about to finish the surrounding reconnaissance and we were about to organize a search group of places where we stepped on a little.

ID=65921002
... Next time will you find someone who has been sucked into the blank?

ID=65921003
It is the best scenario if found.\nEveryone who entered the blank is exceptionally powerful, so if you take them back, the war with Vesi ... I am looking forward to imagination alone.

ID=65921004
In fact, it is not a very good situation to go.\nI tried communicating in all directions with Amanda 's ability, but I did not get any income.

ID=65921005
Still, if you search for it, you may find about one person.\nI ... I want to help one of them.

ID=65921006
%username% is desperate to help others.\nBut we are not satisfied with that degree. Discover different powers at once and take them all back to reality.

ID=65921007
If that happens ... is not it?

ID=65921008
Therefore, I would like to help% a little in%username% this time as well.\nHaha, I'm just bent about leaving.

ID=65921009
No, I was waiting! What on earth is it?

ID=65921010
Currently, our biggest mission is organizing the surroundings.\nSince it is a blank space unknown what will happen, we need to secure safety before other troops come in sequentially.

ID=65921011
Even if it is a flying summer insect,\nSpeaking of great people, they must do it.

ID=65921012
Haha ... The work of the Star Forest Alliance is still tough, is not it?

ID=65921013
It can not be helped even if it goes anywhere, let's keep it about this.\nThen let's get into the main subject.

ID=65921014
Is there a somewhat somewhat ominous building over there over there?\nIt seems to be a blank abnormal phenomenon, but from that, energy that is not extraordinary was perceived.

ID=65921015
As you get close it's quite huge energy. The investigation team who accompanied E.S. P makes it easy for us to break in.

ID=65921016
If others can not do it, I will do it! Let me take care of that!

ID=65921017
How. I am motivated to do it today, was it also a good thing?

ID=65921018
Oh, that is ... I was told that Mr. Tenebris could not be trusted, so I was wondering if I could show off some success.

ID=65921019
I can not trust ... Someone can not be trusted at all.

ID=65921020
You may just pretend to pretend to be a dead five years ago.\nAs much as the same soul worker,%username% is also better to keep cool at a distance.

ID=65921021
... ... Yes ... I will be careful ...

ID=45921001
Search, cheers for good work.

ID=35921001
This ... it was quite annoying.\nNo way, the remnants of Rapid Flame of Grace City will appear to such a place.

ID=15931001
But ... why were you in such a place?

ID=15931002
Like whitespace in the sky of a human city, there is exactly the same blank space in the area of ​​Vesi?

ID=15931003
Simply thought, it was just being sucked in like a human being, poor guys.\nIt's as usual to be hostile to us.

ID=15931004
For the time being, it seems that I have to ask Mr. Tenebris who has lived here for a long time.

ID=55931001
Tenebris - san ... will hear me ...

ID=55931002
What happened, did you fight?

ID=55931003
No, that's not true though .... I'm going!

ID=25931001
Haha, thanks for your hard work today.

ID=65931001
I came back, thanks for your hard work.\nNo way that it will fight with Vesi.

ID=65931002
please do not worry! Because I will beat them all!

ID=65931003
... ... Are not you going to settle in discussion?

ID=65931004
I can do it if I can.

ID=65931005
But they killed millions of people unrelated ... in front of me, everyone ... they died ...\nSo ... I will do the same way.

ID=65931006
... .... After all, was not it someone else ...

ID=65931007
Huh ...? What are you talking about?

ID=65931008
It's nothing ...\nWell, what kind of business did you do?

ID=65931009
Oh, it's not a big deal ... I want to know why there is a Vesi inside the blank.

ID=65931010
Probably, I think that it is not much different from what you guess.\nEven though Vesh, there is nothing never to be sucked into the blank.

ID=65931011
Even when I was actively actively engaged a lot of Vesi came in.\n... But it is weird. Vece who meets in the blank did not attack the human being unconditionally.

ID=65931012
Originally it is a human enemy, so nothing strange.

ID=65931013
Outside of the blank might be due to war, but here it is different.\nAt least I could not make myself understood, so ...

ID=65931014
So, what is it? Now is the enemy of mankind that aims at our life.

ID=65931015
... It is no use trying to persuade me.\nOkay, please do what you think is right.

ID=95931001
Well ... good ... ... Ah, Welcome back%username%.

ID=95931002
What are you carrying? Awesome lot ...

ID=95931003
It is a spirit path finder supported from Heavy Gears of Grace City.\nMachine that is essential for reconnaissance mission to sense the flow of energy.

ID=95931004
Energy flow ... Oh! Check the reaction of Seoul Energy and check the position of human beings!

ID=95931005
It is so in the opinion of a great man.\nIt does not work properly.

ID=95931006
Huh ...? I thought that it was a good method ... Are you doing any breakdowns as well?

ID=95931007
It's not like that, but in the opinion of Dr. Sarah, as so many different people and soul workers are discharged, it seems that Seoul Energy is infesting everywhere.

ID=95931008
It is not a problem that there is no reaction, probably there is too much reaction and it can not distinguish which is which.\nEven though I know all that, I carry this heavy machinery. Because it is a command of a great san ... hahaha.

ID=95931009
... You have trouble.

ID=95931010
Good ... ... ... ah, already, shoulder ...! Why did I do this ...

ID=95931011
If you have time to sort of complaints, please carry one more.\nOr did you get promoted enough to use people in your chin?

ID=95931012
Ah ... will I also carry with you?

ID=95931013
No ... All right. Because%username% has an important mission of setting it on the operational site.

ID=95931014
Exactly. I can not leave such a chore to those who struggle more than us.

ID=95931015
Would you also like to do a briefing?\nNow,%username%. Go ahead and set aside these areas. The more far you install it, the wider the detection range should be.

ID=95931016
Yes! Let me take care of that!

ID=45931001
No, the battle this time was amazing ... exactly massacres!\nThe way you destroy everything without hesitation, it was awesome!

ID=45931002
Hehehe ... Because I fought so much, I wonder if Tenebris can admit it a bit ...

ID=35931001
Oh, is he talking about Tene or tennis?\nI do not like being able to do anything but just keep brace.

ID=35931002
Do not worry about such a line of sight, please do your best as usual.

ID=15941001
First, as a result, the search plan using Spirit Pathfinder is a failure.\n... However, it is a problem that the cause was completely different from what I expected.

ID=15941002
Spirit Pathfinder can not sense Seoul Energy at all.\nIncluding%username% and other energy from other people, all.

ID=15941003
Is that ... broken?

ID=15941004
No, it can not be broken because it is a new item that was newly introduced for the investigation of the blank ...\nEven though the engineers are looking at it, now I just shake my head.

ID=15941005
If that is the case, then there is nothing but direct searching after all ... I will go looking for all the places!

ID=15941006
That's a funny story ... It will only be a waste of time, so I vote against the other way.

ID=15941007
Oh, can you go to Amanda once more than that?\nI was looking for%username% earlier with a serious face.

ID=15941008
Serious face ... I wonder what happened ...?

ID=15941009
Surely, it is probably that such things as having laundered too much to dry up, or forgetting to close the main hopper of the stove.\nLooking for%username% is a washing line thick.

ID=15941010
... I feel Martin 's credibility to Amanda throughout my body.

ID=15941011
Of course it is a joke.\nWhen I checked the status of%username% I seemed to find something strange and I am doing checks over and over.

ID=55941001
Yes, I am going.

ID=25941001
Take care. I will see you off here.

ID=65941001
Ah. %username%, I came!\nI'm busy but I'm sorry for calling you one time.

ID=65941002
Well, I heard that Mr. Amanda looks serious from Martin.

ID=65941003
A serious face ...? Oh, it's not a big deal, I was wondering what the voice I heard was.

ID=65941004
voice ...

ID=65941005
There were times when "laughing" or "came" and sometimes laughing awkward laughter.\nIt seems that it sounds close to%username%, but noise like a tinnitus is also occurring together and it's quite handy to analyze the content.

ID=65941006
Yun ... I heard a ghost voice, or something ...\nHahaha ... do not worry in vain ... Hahaha ...

ID=65941007
It is a place I want to say that it is not a ghost to flowing though ...\nI do not know anything yet.

ID=65941008
Ah ... Hahaha ...

ID=65941009
Do not worry so much. I'm talking to Dr. Sarah of Ruin Fortress now.\nI am more familiar with the theory about energy than anyone, so will I wait until results come out?

ID=65941010
Yes ... please, thank you.\nI think that it may be that a ghost is still attached all the time ... I am anxious ...

ID=65941011
... Because of the bright future of the Star Forest Alliance, we have to process it promptly.

ID=95941001
I am not spirited,%username%.\nWas there something to worry about?

ID=95941002
Well, that is ...

ID=95941003
It seems that something like ghost ... got stuck in me ...\nWhen I think that it may be cursed, I am worried ...

ID=95941004
ghost ...? While I was in the blank, I did not see such a thing ....

ID=95941005
But Amanda says ... Well, if you are in charge of communication, say that "I came" or "Finally" sounded in the vicinity of me

ID=95941006
Voice ... Well ...

ID=95941007
... Maybe you know what Tenebris is?

ID=95941008
... It is common in the blanks. I do not understand details well, do you?

ID=95941009
In any case,%username% should not be a ghost or any kind of anxious concern.\nI guarantee that much.

ID=95941010
Is it true? What? Really, it is not a ghost, is it ...?

ID=95941011
Rather, the ghost might have been better.

ID=95941012
Haha ... still a little relieved ...

ID=95941013
......

ID=95941014
Oh, I was here. I looked for%username%.

ID=95941015
Oh, yes! What happened?

ID=95941016
Did you talk to Amanda? I guess it was incomprehensible.

ID=95941017
No, Amanda taught me about the mysterious phenomenon that is happening to me, it seems she is investigating now.

ID=95941018
Is that so, did you tell me what Teneburis did?\nWhen I hear it becomes a machine that repeats only "I do not know anything".

ID=95941020
Chit ... Also it ...\nRecently it seems to be popular to embrace the secret as much as possible.

ID=95941021
Well, that is postponement. %username%, It seems that we have located the headquarters of the people this time.

ID=95941022
Because the machine is useless, the E.S.P unit directly inspected it and identified the places where they gathered well.\nThere seems to be a machine that collects energy, Flame Tempest.

ID=95941023
Collect energy ... Can you do such a thing with Vesi who is outside?

ID=95941024
No, this is a machine made by a human who cooperated with Vesi.\nRapid Flame was positively using at Grace City.

ID=95941025
Tempest used in Grace City is ...

ID=95941026
I only read in the report, but it was a cruel machine that injected Seoul Energy into a human being, bursting it and collecting it.

ID=95941027
Yes ... that spectacle can not be forgotten ...\nI wonder if it was sucked in with Rapid Flame ...

ID=95941028
Generally speaking, there will be only that route.\nIt would not have been made in the blanks by them.

ID=95941029
... understood. Either way, the goal of going there and destroying everything will not change.\nWell then, let's go.

ID=95941030
After all, the solution of%username% is extreme.

ID=95941031
......

ID=95941032
What happened ... Tenebris.\nDo such a serious look.

ID=95941033
No ... nothing.\nNow, just a little ... I seem to have seen%username% I know ...

ID=45941001
It did really well!\nWith the success of%username%, the surrounding Rapid Flame retreats and the Fortune troops can enter.

ID=45941002
Thanks to you, you said that you injured and cowards trying to escape from the blank\nIt has become possible to stop it.\nFloof ... ...%username% everyone.

ID=35941001
I wonder ... I wonder what a bad thing has happened ...

ID=15951001
It seems that Miriam is coming at the dispatch of Fortune troops.\nIt seemed to be busy in assembling a medical tent, how about going to see him?

ID=55951001
Yes of course! We have to help with assembly work of the tent!

ID=55951002
No, I did not say that with that intention ...\nEven if it is not so busy. Please rest when you do not have a job.

ID=55951003
Haha ... no matter how much it moves, it's not a tiring body so it's okay!\nWell, let's go!

ID=25951001
Oh, were not you going?

ID=65951001
Oh,%username%!\nI am sorry, was it a bit late, is not it? It takes more time to prepare than I thought ...

ID=65951002
That's fine, that's OK! Oh, shall we help you assemble the tent?

ID=65951003
No, it's okay! Assembling of the tent is almost done!\nEven though I'm just busy, I can not increase the work of%username% any more.

ID=65951004
I am all right, but everyone is worried too much.

ID=65951005
That's it. Well, could you tell me about the situation here?\nI have been preparing at Loco Town for a long time and I do not understand anything.

ID=65951006
Especially this is nothing special, is not it sweeping away since Rapid Flame appeared?

ID=65951007
Vece who was in Grace City ... It is came to such a place ...

ID=65951008
It seems that Vesi was sucked into the blank.\nNow I have kicked them out, so do not worry!

ID=65951009
About people sucked in? I heard that one person has not been helped yet though ...

ID=65951010
It seems ... when we came in there was nobody anymore ...

ID=65951011
... that's it.

ID=65951012
But I think that it is not dead or such ... I am staying here.

ID=65951013
Oh, that's right. It is a subtle thing whether it can be called a person ... but still there was a person who was here.\nI am a person named Tenebris, but ...

ID=65951014
Tenebris ...! What?

ID=65951015
Yes. ... Did you mean you know?

ID=65951016
No ... nothing ...\nI was surprised that the name of the legendary soul worker who died suddenly five years ago came out ...

ID=65951017
I see. I was also very surprised when I first heard the story.

ID=65951018
That's ... how about you? What did you talk with that person?

ID=65951019
No, it seems like you know a lot about blanks ...\nI was told I still can not trust me ...

ID=65951020
Well, yeah ... did not you feel better? Memory? Someone ... There is a person to remember, do not say something like that?

ID=65951021
Er ....\nIf you want to know so much, you'd better talk more directly than talking to me ...

ID=65951022
That's right! You should listen directly, right?\nHaha, I am a bit crazy today, are not you?

ID=65951023
Oh, sorry,%username%! I have talked too much about building the camp yet!\nThe talk is here! Will you come back later?

ID=65951024
see you soon! See you next time!

ID=65951025
Huh ...? Oh, yes ...

ID=65951026
... I guess I said something strange ...?

ID=95951001
Tenebris! I have finished all this time!

ID=95951002
It seems like that, I had a hard time.\nYou really do not have time to work.

ID=95951003
Ejeke ... It is natural that it fights to protect everyone!

ID=95951004
... Is that so.

ID=95951005
Well then did you admit it?\nI did my best this time ...

ID=95951006
That's ... unfortunately not.\nIt is still hard to trust you, rather it got a little bit of anxiety.

ID=95951007
An uneasy point ... I, did you make something wrong again?

ID=95951008
Then, please let me hear only one.\nMr.%username%, what are you fighting against the enemy for? What is life going on?

ID=95951009
Huh ...? That is, I want to save lots of people ...

ID=95951010
No, please exclude such a global reason.\nIt is not a dream of students who went to senior high school.

ID=95951011
But this is the fact ...\nI wanted to be a doctor to help others ...

ID=95951012
%username%, you are not a legendary brave person used by God.\nOriginally it is an ordinary human being, human does not act unless there is a fundamental purpose.

ID=95951013
Save money and honor if you save humanity. It is rather convincing if it is aimed at it.\n... But your reason is to hide the fundamental purpose and excuse me for a cause.

ID=95951014
I ... I do not understand even if it is said with difficult words.\nI really want to help a lot of people ...

ID=95951015
Is that so? If you can not be aware, I will say.\n%username%, you are ...

ID=95951016
Rather than rescue the world ... is not it obsessed with "killing the other person for disapproval of someone's revenge"?

ID=95951017
... Huh?

ID=95951018
From the time you first met, you talked about enemy monsters and Vesi's 'act of robbing life' as inevitable.\nLike ... like%username% I met in old days.

ID=95951019
So I remembered anxiety from the time I put you in charge.

ID=95951020
That ... what does that mean?\nUm ... that I met Tenebrus, I ...!

ID=95951021
Absolutely not.

ID=95951022
......

ID=95951023
I do not know what you are going to do from now on, but I can not trust you at least now.

ID=95951024
In this body, which is soul spirit, I can only watch over you,\nI still understand your danger.

ID=95951025
So what on earth are you talking about ...

ID=95951026
Of course you will not know what you have lost memory,\nI would be fortunate not to know.

ID=95951027
I'm sorry I caused confusion with unnecessary talk.\n... But%username%, please once worry about what you are doing.

ID=95951028
......

ID=45951001
I do not feel fine,%username%.\nHave you been bullied by legendary soul workers?

ID=35951001
Ahaha ... I was talking a little troubled.

ID=35951002
Is that so. Well then, will you take a break?\nIf my heart is upset, I can not fight properly.

ID=35951003
No, it's okay! Rather it has to work harder to be accepted by Mr. Tenebris ...!

ID=35951004
There is no need to worry about that bastard.\nYou only have to do what you think is correct for%username%.

ID=15961001
Well then, let's spare your words and talk about work.\nRapid Flame was completely exterminated, but also a place that might be an acquaintance appeared.

ID=15961002
E.S.P unit has already abandoned the search because it is dangerous because you do not know what will come out.\nIf%username% is OK ...

ID=15961003
No, to be honest. Investigation is impossible unless it is%username%.\nPlease ask for my best regards.

ID=55961001
Yes, please leave it!

ID=55961002
... It is truly a pleasure.

ID=25961001
Survey, thank you.

ID=45961001
I have no idea what happened.

ID=45961002
I am also confused.\nThe enemy that appeared at that time was a figure similar to the enemy%username% fought before ... Is that it?

ID=35961001
Yes, I think that it is probably a vision.

ID=35961002
Well ... I did not understand anything after all.\nHowever, Tenebrus who was living here may know something. Why do not you ask?

ID=15971001
Mr. Tenebris ... is it?

ID=15971002
It is a floating face. Did you do a fight?

ID=15971003
No, it's not like that ...\nSomehow, it seems that the walls have been made ...

ID=15971004
Is it so? I think about going with you if it is hard to talk.

ID=55971001
... ... If you are OK, I would like to ask ...

ID=55971002
There was something I wanted to ask a lot to Tenebris.\nOK, let's go together.

ID=25971001
Here we go.

ID=65971001
Oh, hello ... Tenebris.

ID=65971002
Hello,%username%.\nIt was also a big success this time.

ID=65971003
Oh, no ... Hahaha, that's a big success ...

ID=65971004
It is the appeal of%username% to do whatever you can not do to anyone else, while being modest.

ID=65971005
But the Star Forest is not dependent on that power too much.\nIs there not anything left to be left to the people of different powers?

ID=65971006
Haha, there is no word to return.\nHowever, even if I am sorry now, I will lower my head, but my pride will fall to the bottom of the earth if it says to change.

ID=65971007
I think it is natural for people with power to fight for people without power.\n... But let's leave it all to such a girl, it is doubtful whether we can grow human beings autonomously from now on.

ID=65971008
Wow ... I'm okay!

ID=65971009
Before becoming a soul worker my dream was to help people ...\nThat's why it's tough but I am satisfied with my life now!

ID=65971010
... .... Do you say such a thing ...

ID=65971011
Huh ...?

ID=65971012
No, there is nothing. Besides that, do not you have something else to ask if you two ask me?

ID=65971013
Hahaha, I am fostering love on a date.

ID=65971014
Ma ... Martin!

ID=65971015
How is it? Do men and women feel that they are a bit too cluttered to enjoy dates?

ID=65971016
... ... It is a joke! That's not it! Absolutely not! Even if you die, it is wrong!

ID=65971017
... Do not get hurt like running if it is violently denied up to that point.

ID=65971018
It is not a time to play around now.\nUm, Tenebris. I would like to know more about the phenomenon why the whitespace creates ...

ID=65971019
This is a place full of blanks, phenomena which can not be explained by common sense.\nBecause it is filled with Desire Energy, no matter what happens, there is nothing to be surprised about.

ID=65971020
Desire Energy ... ?! Are those words serious?

ID=65971021
Oh, did not you know?

ID=65971022
I do not know or nothing, how can I investigate the inaccessible blanks.

ID=65971023
I see ... I will have to explain from the nature of the blank.

ID=65971024
The blank is not a natural disaster nor a special space, it is a mass of enormous designer energy.\nOne big energy with the desire to "breathe everything".

ID=65971025
Therefore, in this area where we stand, Desire Energy is more familiar than air.

ID=65971026
I see ... was there reason why the Spirit Pathfinder that senses soul energy did not work?

ID=65971027
The reaction of Seoul Energy was drowned out by overwhelming Desire Energy and I could not sense anything.\nIt would have been noticed if Dr. Sarah was there, but anyway it is not when you need to say a human.

ID=65971028
No, wait ...?\nAmanda 's communication capability will be using Seoul Energy, so why can you use it?

ID=65971029
Soul Energy and Desire Energy should have had the property of extinguishing when they hit each other?

ID=65971030
......

ID=65971031
Well, if you say that,%username% can not use the power of soul worker,\nI should have said that it was good.

ID=65971032
For the time being, I will ask the person of the discrimination group investigating this energy to dispatch in the blank as promptly as possible.\n%username% is resting during that time.

ID=65971033
Huh ...! What? Um, I am OK! Because it is a soul worker, it's about Designer Energy ...

ID=65971034
It is dangerous to move unnecessarily, as I understood that this is the base of Desire Energy.\nYou have to know in advance what the influence is at a minimum.

ID=65971035
Now, as work gets full - blown, I do not have time to rest, so let 's take a rest now.\nThis is a command as a commander.

ID=65971036
...... understood.

ID=95971001
Mr. Miriam, Hello!

ID=95971002
Oh, well ...

ID=95971003
Um ... Is it sick anywhere physical condition?

ID=95971004
Hmm ... Thank you for worrying.\nBut, I am OK because my condition is not bad ... there is a little personal concern.

ID=95971005
Please let me know if you have any worries!\nI am good at helping people and breaking something, so if such a problem ...

ID=95971006
That ... that is not so serious! Just ... well ...

ID=95971007
I was talking with Tenebris earlier, did not he?\nDid not you talk something about Tenebris, me?

ID=95971008
Huh ...? No, nothing ...

ID=95971009
I see ...\nThen, what did you talk about?

ID=95971010
There is not much talk ...

ID=95971011
Well ... I guess ... Uh ... well ...

ID=95971012
Well, if I have something to tell you about Tenebris, shall I tell him instead?

ID=95971013
Oh, no! I do not care for something ...

ID=95971014
Just ... Well ... I can talk to myself if I can organize my mind.

ID=95971015
Um ... maybe ... Miriam is acquainted with Mr. Tenebris?

ID=95971016
Increase! What? No it is ...\nAbsolutely, perhaps!

ID=95971017
The confirmation and the conjecture are together?

ID=95971018
Um ... that's because it's a legendary soul worker! A little ... Is it enviable? Anyway, that's right!

ID=95971019
Well ...

ID=95971020
I have a bit more trouble than that ... can I ask you a moment?

ID=95971021
of course! I do not know if I will be useful, but please say anything!

ID=95971022
... you know what.

ID=95971023
Well, that's not my story, but my friends! There was a man who used to be friends ...\nBut that person may have lost his memory and may not remember anything ...

ID=95971024
It looks like a novel, but the real story ... ha ...

ID=95971025
Well ... So are you troubled with that friend?\nAfter all, Miriam is a kind person.

ID=95971026
No ...! Yes Yes!\nThat friend likes that person ... so, I want to help you.

ID=95971027
I agree ...\nI too ... I hope I can help you.

ID=95971028
... So is not it? When that friend met with a guy ... I wonder if I should say a voice ...?

ID=95971029
The man seems to be unaware of his friends ... I am not in the blank ... friends in the hospital! There is no compensation that I have met the man.

ID=95971030
When you call out more than anything, you may be hurt if anyone eyes you ...\nTrue, I wonder what I should do ... I'm troubled ...

ID=95971031
A little ... It is a bad situation. Where is the friend?

ID=95971032
Er ...? ... maybe ... somewhere in the Crow Dream ...\nSuddenly why?

ID=95971033
I wonder if I should speak directly.

ID=95971034
Thank you ... Although I am thankful for your thoughts, enough to just tell me! I am a close friend of mine, so I will tell you everything!

ID=95971035
Is that so? Then once, I will tell you my opinion ...

ID=95971036
First of all ... I think I have to approach that man as soon as possible.

ID=95971037
Are you OK? If it became a burden or not me ... If I had not remembered that person ... what should I do?

ID=95971038
If I am scared and do not do anything ... as I said, nothing happens.

ID=95971039
Of course, it may be difficult to call out immediately, or you can keep silent without hurting.\n... But then, I think that only regret will remain forever.

ID=95971040
That 's why ... I definitely would like to speak at least once!

ID=95971041
Yeah ... I see ... is that so?\nall right! Thanks to my decision I got it!

ID=95971042
Is it my friend?

ID=95971043
No! Of course friends! ... I am certainly excited somewhere! Haha ...!

ID=95971044
Oh, that's right, just a call came! It seems that Martin is calling.

ID=95971045
Martin is ...? I wonder if I could do something big ...\nI will go there soon!

ID=95971046
Yeah ... Thank you%username%! Come again!

ID=95971047
... Shall I start with preparation of my heart?

ID=45971001
Is your vacation already OK?

ID=45971002
Huh ...? I asked Mr. Miriam that Mr. Martin's call was made, but ...

ID=45971003
I do not have any bad taste like calling me immediately after issuing a vacation order.\nI dislike most as one of the victims. That's it.

ID=45971004
When you have to take a day off, take a good rest.\nIf I have power, I intend to fight against the power of the darkness for the security of the rest of the soldiers.

ID=45971005
Haha ... that's right.\nThen why does Mr. Miriam make me Martin?

ID=45971006
You did it even bad things?\nIf not, it would have been something to hide.

ID=45971007
Well ... I have to talk later.

ID=45971008
Anyway, there is no work at rest%username%. Somewhere different ....

ID=45971009
House! I already rested enough!\nIf you have any work, please let me know!

ID=45971010
Well ... I see ...? I really appreciate it if you will help me ...\nIs it really okay?

ID=45971011
of course! Though people other than me are fighting, thinking that I am just taking a rest, I can not come easy at all ...

ID=45971012
Hmm ... If so, I'm sorry but I beg you to thank you ...

ID=45971013
Yes! What should I do?

ID=45971014
In the place where%username% did the investigation the other day, a similar illusion appears.

ID=45971015
The phantom itself was cleared up by the E.S.P unit ... something a little troubled happened

ID=45971016
Troubled ... What is it?

ID=35971001
A clown clown, Edgar appeared.

ID=35971002
Edgar ...!

ID=15981001
Although it is an illusion,%username% who is engaged in battle as being a Vesi belonging to a danger class is the most suitable.\nOriginally I was planning to let our E.S.P unit process it, but it is a fact that it is a burden.

ID=15981002
......

ID=15981003
It is a floating face. I understand that I will be tired from shortly after the last battle.\nIf the condition is not good, again%username% is resting ...

ID=15981004
No, I just remembered the old days. ... I will go.\nEven if the whole body is torn, I rescue people.

ID=15981005
%username% is the most important force indispensable for the Star Forest Alliance.\nPlease let me know soon if there are any points to worry about.

ID=15981006
Haha, thank you for being worried ...

ID=15981007
I'm more concerned than saying I'm worried.\nIf the day%username% falls down, that day is exactly the crisis of mankind.

ID=15981008
Do not abuse your body for world peace.\nLike the time of Zion.

ID=55981001
Yes, of course! I'm going!

ID=55981002
I am sorry to rely on it after all, but do not try too hard.

ID=25981001
Have not you gone yet? Hahaha, you can take a day off if you want to have a break.

ID=45981001
Good job. You returned well.

ID=45981002
I am really tired this time ...

ID=45981003
By the way it seems I was talking to someone during the investigation ...\nDid something happen?

ID=45981004
It sounded like ... I heard it is audible ...\nNow I do not have to know, something strange ...

ID=45981005
I did not know who he was saying ...\nThat ... I was a bit scared ... It sounded like a ghost full of resentment ...

ID=45981006
It's not ...\nNo, it's impossible ...

ID=45981007
Oh, did you come by Tenebris?\nIf you have something to know, please tell me everything.

ID=45981008
Because it may be my misunderstanding.\n... It is true that I want you to be a misunderstanding.

ID=45981009
I have to tell any misunderstanding.\nWill you tell me so that our investigation will be furious?

ID=45981010
I am sorry, but I can not say that.

ID=45981011
A bit Tene, we met someone who was not flexible like you before we came here.\nHe told me not to say anything until after the incident eventually told me to tell me.

ID=45981012
We learned then. It is said that you should keep listening persistently even if you say that you do not want to say it.\nIf you do not say it now, you will witness the persistence of our research team?

ID=45981013
I am also suffering from a feeling of wanting to say ...

ID=45981014
So why?

ID=45981015
... Here I say,%username% is dangerous.

ID=45981016
...%username% is?

ID=45981017
I am okay ... Any words are okay so ... please ...

ID=45981018
Do you declare that you are all right without knowing anything?

ID=45981019
That ... There is no grounds, but I am confident.\nBecause I have endured anything even now ...

ID=45981020
I can not deny that Mr.%username% has sent a much more terrible life than any other person.

ID=45981021
But the truth I know is different in dimension than what you have ever experienced.\nYou can not trust even if you are told simply that you are confident.

ID=45981022
Well then ...! What should I do ...?

ID=45981023
... I have one single request to tell you.

ID=35981001
Leave here. And here we are not somewhere to fight for people.

ID=15991001
For the safety of people ... let's leave ...?\nWhy is that ...

ID=15991002
Wait a moment ... say what you do not understand ... and leave%username%!

ID=15991003
In the first place, if%username% leaves here, it will interfere with the investigation of the blank.\nPerhaps you give up the investigation and you may have to return the baggage together!

ID=15991004
Is the Star Forest Union a group that can not do anything because there is no soul worker alone?\nEven if%username% alone is gone ...

ID=15991005
It's not a simple dependency problem! Those who do not understand do not speak!

ID=15991006
Declining morale of the survey team is also a problem.\nBecause of the concern that you may be terrible at times, the number of people who will leave will be going on.

ID=15991007
In the first place, there are many people who participate in the survey just because there are soul workers.\nIf%username% is gone, the investigation team will lose its root.

ID=15991008
Of course%username% Although the collective dependence is concentrated on one person.\nWe have to understand that the investigation can proceed because there is the%username%.

ID=15991009
If so, please leave everyone.\nIt is dangerous to stop%username% in this abnormal space.

ID=15991010
I can not do that! You may have clues to save the world here.

ID=15991011
... Of course it is important to know that if you return home by hand, you will get painful eyes from great people,\nThat's a personal matter ...

ID=15991012
It is a blank space that can finally be investigated by finding things.\nIt's been 15 years since the blanks were opened, and there is no precedent as one.

ID=15991013
I can not give up the opportunity I might grasp the clues to save the people suffering from the blanks.\nAnything is okay, I will not go back until I get results here.

ID=15991014
... Haha ... Mr. Martin, was unexpectedly serious.

ID=15991015
I have no will to motivate myself not to want to.\nThere was no reason I came up to the commander at this age.

ID=15991016
Besides, there is no one to come here to take the command except me.\nThe wonderful one will stand out on his own regret. So, I have to do it.

ID=15991017
It is more stubborn than I thought ...\nLet's ask%username%, Are you sure that you can bear with whatever happens?

ID=15991018
That ... What do you mean?

ID=15991019
If you stay here like this, you will certainly have a day to regret.\nThat's why I'm listening.

ID=15991020
You certainly are strong.\nBut before then it was an ordinary human being, is not he a student?

ID=15991021
It is a time when emotions appear most clearly and clearly, and it is also a time when emotions can not be controlled at the same time.\nEven if you recognize yourself as strong, there are things that will be broken by something that is nothing.

ID=15991022
Do not worry, Tenebris!\nIf it was a broken experience, I endured a lot more.

ID=15991023
Above all, there are not any people who can fight a strong enemy besides me?\nNo matter what kind of enemy appears ... I will defeat everyone with my power!

ID=15991024
......

ID=15991025
... Haha ... whatever you solve physically.\nAs a matter of fact%username% is reliable.

ID=15991026
No. I think that I just do not understand how serious the current situation is.\n%username% is also stubborn than it looks.

ID=15991027
I am sorry, but I will tell you the place from now on so that no one will be asked.\nPlease follow me where I was.

ID=55991001
Yes, I do not care ...

ID=55991002
I'm sorry, can the commander wait in another place?

ID=55991003
If it's an important story, I think it is necessary for me to be a commander as well.

ID=55991004
It is a personal story.\nIf you want to know the contents, please listen to me personally later.

ID=55991005
However, I do not know if%username% will talk.

ID=55991006
Well ... I am worried about what you are talking about ...\nThere is no help if it is a personal story. understood.

ID=25991001
... Please tell me later what you talked about.

ID=65991001
I have been waiting for you.\nActually ... I am still wondering what I should do about this story.

ID=65991002
My mind is ready.\nNo matter what kind of story you hear from now on, it's okay!

ID=65991003
I do not even know what I'm talking about from now on to say I'm OK ...\nSuch unfounded confidence is not courage but just arrogance.

ID=65991004
... Yes ... to be careful ...

ID=65991005
House! I am confident! Any talk is absolutely safe!

ID=65991006
... I can see that being augmented is visible\nI do not seem to go back any more, so I will tell you.

ID=65991007
There is one thing I want to confirm just before entering the main subject.\nI told you heard a voice of unknown identity in the previous strategy, can you tell me more about that voice?

ID=65991008
No ... I do not understand well, but it was a bit strange.\nIt is similar to my voice ... It was a completely different person ...

ID=65991009
It resembled%username% 's voice ... is not it?

ID=65991010
Yes ....

ID=65991011
... Then you do not have to hesitate to tell this content.

ID=65991012
I will ask just one thing before entering the main subject.\n%username% is Irwin ArcLight, Stella · Munbell, Lily · Bloom fairy tale.\nDo you know these three people?

ID=65991013
No ... at all ...

ID=65991014
You do not seem to know really. ... understood.

ID=65991015
The name I mentioned at the moment is Desirey Workers who were active in the blank.\nWe absorbed enormous power here, the territory of Desire, and slaughtered people indiscriminately.

ID=65991016
Desire worker ... Is it similar to Seoul workers?

ID=65991017
Yes. There is a difference in the name of energy to use and the driving force of power, but you can think that it is almost unchanged.

ID=65991018
But like Vesi they were just loyal to their "desires".\nSimply hate human beings and enjoy violence ... Also, it was simply the reason that it is fun to die people.

ID=65991019
They already missed the ordinary as a human being.\nI deny everything except myself ... It was exactly how I realized desire.

ID=65991020
I fought with them many times in the blank.\nWake up as a "true" soul worker ... to protect people and "justice".

ID=65991021
As you can see now, thanks to that, I was able to become "a soul worker of justice".

ID=65991022
I do not know whether people like me can say such a thing ...\nMy heart that I want to fight for people is not defeated by Tenebris.

ID=65991023
Well ... That's right.\nIf not, "It is different from the past" Now that mind may be your truth.

ID=65991024
Unlike before ... ... What do you mean?

ID=65991025
... There were leaders in the designer workers who killed human beings.

ID=65991026
At the same time as being a leader, it was also all the culprits.\nThe designer workers acted mainly with her and united again.

ID=65991027
The first time I met her was shortly after she was sucked into the blank.\nAt that time she seemed to be dead everyday, sitting in the corner, trembling and crying alone while trembling.

ID=65991028
She lost her mother because of the blanks and her heart completely collapsed ...\nDesire energies, that is, it was a fine bait targeted by desire.

ID=65991029
At that time I was preserving her thinking that she was a poor girl who was involved in disaster ...\n... Now I regret not having killed her that day.

ID=65991030
Ah ... ... It is a sad story ...

ID=65991031
...%username%, your story.

ID=65991032
... Huh?

ID=65991033
A girl who accepted Designer Energy with the desire of "Revenge" of the lost family and killed all things randomly ...\nI know%username% was such a existence.

ID=65991034
No way, no way ...\nIt's just another person who's the same name ...

ID=65991035
I also believed that at first it was another person. No, I think the word that I wanted to believe is appropriate.

ID=65991036
It was exactly the same name, appearance, even voice, but since only the personality was completely changed,\nI had a little hope.

ID=65991037
But that voice that%username% heard ...\nPerhaps there is a past%username% I know about as a residual of desire around%username%.

ID=65991038
In other words ... I believe that%username% in front of you is another personality created by memory loss.

ID=65991039
No ... I can not help ... to help people ...

ID=65991040
I think that the only thing remaining in%username% who escaped from the blank and lost memory of 15 years was only the desire to lose purpose.

ID=65991041
And the first thing you jumped into your eyes is "human crisis".\nDesire of Desire who lost its purpose was replaced with the desire of "to save humanity".

ID=65991042
Otherwise, just because a high school student,%username%, can not compete with life just because there is a different ability.\nHuman heart is not pure and strong so far.

ID=65991043
... No way.

ID=65991044
No ... It is a conclusion that I convinced as a result of watching quietly until now.\nTo deny is nothing more than escapism of reality.

ID=65991045
If you tell this fact, I knew that%username% would be shocked.\nSo, I did not want to talk as much as possible.

ID=65991046
But if%username% will stay here, someday your shadow ... past%username% will swallow you.\nSince it is necessary to avoid only that, so we talked to him ...

ID=65991047
You are different from you in the past. You can still escape from here enough.\nSo please, please leave from here.

ID=65991048
... I do not understand.\nEven if you suddenly say such a thing, what should I do? .

ID=65991049
Excuse me.\nCan you give me some time to think a little?

ID=65991050
Yes, you will not be able to decide immediately ...\nI am waiting for you here.

ID=95991001
Ha ha ha! Did you ask all the stories?

ID=95991002
Tenebris was trying to hide it, but let's hear from himself.\nNow,%username%! Share important information for the future of humanity!

ID=95991003
......

ID=95991004
Um ...%username%?

ID=95991005
Ah! Yes! Where is the enemy! What?

ID=95991006
The attitude that I always face with the attitude of attitude is fine, but now will you listen to me a little more?

ID=95991007
Sorry ... I'm sorry!

ID=95991008
So did Tenebris talk about something serious?\nIf you listen to how serious it is, you will be wondering if it will make you so distracted.

ID=95991009
Ah, that ... that is ...\nI'm sorry but I could not hear such a stupid story ...

ID=95991010
Even one of the trivial contents is fine. Tell me whatever it is.

ID=95991011
... Excuse me.

ID=95991012
Hahaha ... No way ... have you been kept in the mouth?\nThat man, do a gentle face and do it unexpectedly.

ID=95991013
Well, that's not it ... there are a lot of hard to say ...

ID=95991014
It seems that it is not content that you can speak lightly from the expression.\nIf you do not want to talk, I will give up listening too.

ID=95991015
We are a smart research team that actually conducts surveys, tracks and finds information,\nIt is not a detective who interrogates people and makes information.

ID=95991016
Thank you for caring for me ...

ID=95991017
I do not know what I talked about, but I am very tired.\nFor a while leave the survey to us and rest a little%username%.

ID=95991018
Um, Martin ... I want to save people ...\nSince becoming a soul worker, I have never changed this idea even once.

ID=95991019
Yes, the majority of the disabled people and the soul workers all say the same way.

ID=95991021
At one time I used the soul worker like a tool, but that was an old story.

ID=95991022
... tool.\nIt is a sad reality ...

ID=95991023
Well, from the point of view of the great men, I and the general soldiers are treated the same,\nAt least I think that I should never forgive people like "old-handed" like old days.

ID=95991024
I think that the current commanders have a fixed idea since they saw the disinterested people used at the time of the past war.\nIt is strong and it is a dangerous existence which is not too tired even if fighting, so you should use it.

ID=95991025
Think about it, would not it be hard if existence that has strength far apart from humans also causes a revolt?\nSo it seems that in the past Star Forest it was trying to control from the mental side.

ID=95991026
But I ... I will change that stereotype from my generation.\nTherefore, while grinding sesame to the great people, they are hitting ...

ID=95991027
I am going to use it as a tool against the different persons and soul workers who have been used as tools in the past\nI also think that it is an apology.

ID=95991028
Ah ... Is not it nice ...

ID=95991029
It looks like it's not true, but thanks.\nAnyway, please take a short rest.

ID=45991001
Hello,%username% ... My facial expressions are dark.

ID=45991002
Yes ... that ...

ID=45991003
I thought that it was bad for you ... Actually, I was listening to the story secretly.

ID=45991004
Oh, that's right ...

ID=45991005
Haha ... the feeling that everything I know is denied ...\nIt was shocking beyond my expectation.

ID=45991006
Um ... Miriam ... I wonder if the word Tenebris said is true ...\nIs it that Tenebris is lying to you ...?

ID=45991007
I want to think that it is a lie ...

ID=45991008
Well ... it's bad for%username%\nI do not think Tenebras' words are lies. .

ID=45991009
why?

ID=45991010
I was caught up by helping someone and helping with it all the time.\nIt is terrifying for someone to hurt while working from morning till night, sometimes he does not care about myself and is unfaithful.

ID=45991011
Every time there was such a thing, I was not able to answer clearly when asked, "Why will you help people while risking?"\nI merely vaguely thought that it was my job to cure people.

ID=45991012
But it seems that it is convincing that the obsession with helping people was actually moved by other power.\n... Rather, I think so.

ID=35991001
So what is the power that people originally have is Desire Energy?\nAll my actions ... Just just that designer's energy did it ...?

ID=35991002
......

ID=16001001
Hey,%username%. There is no crazy question, but can you tell me what your future dream is?

ID=16001002
My ... a future dream? Suddenly what ...

ID=16001003
I just asked, so please try saying that.

ID=16001004
My future dream is ...\nTreat people ... to become a doctor.

ID=16001005
Why did you want to be a doctor? Did you earn a lot of money at that time?

ID=16001006
No ... I want to cure injured or sick people ... I want to help those who suffer ...

ID=16001007
Its appearance is very cool and I have longed for it ...\n... I also want to cure my mom and dad when I suddenly suddenly ... to ...

ID=16001008
Yes. That was your dream 15 years ago.\nIt does not matter with Desire Energy or the power of desire ... was it purely your wish?

ID=16001009
... Yes.

ID=16001010
So how about now? I just want to protect people, do not you?\nRegardless of the foundation of your power, the initial goal of you has not changed anyway.

ID=16001011
Of course I want to save people! That way you can wield as many swords as you can!\nI already got used to defeat the enemies already fighting!

ID=16001012
Haha ... I'm a little scared of what you are talking ... ... If your idea is so, is that enough?

ID=16001013
Of course it is true that our power has a creepy root.\nBut, regardless of the past and the power ... now, we are people ... we want to save humanity, are not we?

ID=16001014
... Yes, of course!

ID=16001015
I know%username% is when someone is dangerous,\nEven if I am afraid it is a girl who runs straight to the spot.

ID=16001016
Many people now depend on you alone.\n... Please, do not collapse here.

ID=56001001
... I agree.\nHelping people is an ancient dream ... Even without Desire Energy, I think I was saving people ...

ID=56001002
Yup! You ought to care about what others say.\nIt is enough for you to do what you should do!

ID=56001003
I, too ... I think it is a fate to treat people and save them.

ID=56001004
that! I could do something a bit and I will go to see Mr. Tenebris! Next time, I will come again!

ID=56001005
Yup ...! Be sure to come back again!

ID=56001006
... Tenebris, or ...

ID=26001001
Huhu, did you solve your problem?

ID=66001001
Tenebris!

ID=66001002
......

ID=66001003
Apparently, as far as looking at all the expressions, I seem to have brought back the worst reply.

ID=66001004
No! Absolutely, it is a reply for the world!

ID=66001005
Giving up fighting here for%username% and withdrawing is a reply for the world.\nThat is why I finally decided to tell you everything.

ID=66001006
I also as a soul worker who fought for justice at a glass cover camp.\n... I only wish that%username% of the era that I know will not wake up.

ID=66001007
Anyway, Tenebris is going to believe what I want to do now.\nLike I have done so!

ID=66001008
... I persuaded as much as I could, so I have no way to stop you.\nYou seem to have no choice but to watch how you progress from now on.

ID=66001009
Haha, will you still remain! Thank you,%username%!\nI did not get sneaky by words of ghosts!

ID=66001010
It is not a ghost, please refrain from words.

ID=66001011
But bad news to%username% who made a new determination here.

ID=66001012
Huh ...? No way, someone died ...

ID=66001013
No, again, there is only the excellent people from the search group as E.S. P, a force-force unit.\nI picked up only necessary information and returned safely without injuries.

ID=66001014
However, as I said earlier, I have bad news.\nIt seems that Junk Knight who made Kandusity disturbance was found at a time.

ID=66001015
Junk Night ...

ID=66001016
It is Seoul Junk based on soul workers.\nThere is a high possibility that it appears as an illusion like before, but it is hard to say that it is weaker than the real one considering the precedent.

ID=66001017
There are only about%username%, the same soul worker, as a countermeasure.\nI just asked something difficult to complain.

ID=66001018
No problem.\nI am going now!

ID=66001019
You do not even feel tired.\n... Was there something that got the power like?

ID=66001020
There is nothing in particular.\nHowever, only a blank answer remains as to whether her conclusion is truly correct.

ID=46001001
......

ID=46001002
If it is a mission report, should not I go to Martin instead of me?

ID=46001003
Mr. Tenebris ... Ah ...

ID=46001004
Are you planning to say it is horrible now?\n... Of course, that's a wise decision.

ID=46001005
In the previous strategy%username% heard a very clear auditory listening ... is not it?\nThat is a proof that you are little bit eroded by Desire Energy.

ID=46001006
If you noticed how many people will be sacrificed by an unnecessary battle ... even now ...

ID=46001007
Please tell me how to defeat him who called out to me!

ID=46001008
%username% first stop thinking about a noisy solution first!

ID=46001009
... Do you think that you can solve anything by fighting and winning?

ID=46001010
Anything is wrong with his identity who calls me ...!\nI ... Because he is a completely different person from him!

ID=46001011
So, I will destroy it so that I can not say anything more ... I am going to erase it!\nThat is necessary to help people! What?

ID=46001012
Calm down,%username%.\n... Do you know what you are talking about now?

ID=46001013
Fearing enemies without fear is one of my few advantages.\nNow I can do the best ...

ID=46001014
That's why I try to distract me ...

ID=46001015
I will say it again. Calm down%username%.\nIf I do not calm down, I will not say anything anymore.

ID=46001016
Yes ...\nI'm sorry, I get disturbed a bit ...

ID=46001017
It is not something that%username% apologizes.\n... It is a blank way to stimulate people like this.

ID=46001018
The blank stimulates the trauma and fear of the targeted human being, and guides the target to want "power".

ID=46001019
And if the subject shows "desire" that strongly desires "power\

ID=46001020
It may be one of the phenomena produced by Energy's desire that%username% occasionally show aggressive aggression.\nIt is a story that little by little, but it is definitely eroded while the person himself does not understand.

ID=46001022
But, I will stop here ...!

ID=46001023
Oh, I was here.%username%! It's a request for a fairly dangerous work from the search group.

ID=46001024
I am okay. Because I never had not been dangerous.\nI will fight all the way through.

ID=46001025
Prepare is amazing ... According to the report it seems that quite awkward enemies appeared for%username%.

ID=46001026
That does not matter! Right now I want to fight until my indignation fits!

ID=46001027
Codename Amaryllis, which is the result of a research by Ned Company which made Temporary Candasity a noise.\nDoes%username% know this name?

ID=46001028
... Amaryllis ...!

ID=46001029
... It is rough. Looking at that figure, it seems that the blanks have prepared a fairly powerful toy this time.

ID=46001030
I was troubled ...\nAccording to the report,%username% is a friend of Amaryllis host Katherine ...

ID=46001031
Please stop beyond that ...\nPlease ...

ID=46001032
Excuse me.\nI told extra things.

ID=46001033
But it certainly became it.\n%username%. You must never fight here any more.

ID=46001034
Your desire for anger is now uncontrollable as far as I can see.\nIt will absolutely take advantage of your trauma and weaknesses and erode Desire.

ID=46001035
Desire ...? What is that story Tenebus.\n%username% can not have Desire Energy.

ID=46001036
Is%username% originally a soul worker?\nSince Seoul Energy and Desire Energy can not coexist, no matter how much erosion is done ...

ID=46001037
Oh, in other people you were a "soul worker".

ID=46001038
Of course, it is Seoul workers. What's wrong with that?

ID=46001039
please do not worry.\nThis is something that%username% needs to say directly, not me.

ID=46001040
......

ID=36001001
Well then, I will ask.

ID=36001002
%username%.\nCan you now believe that you can fight without losing yourself to Amaryllis and to the end?

ID=36001003
This is not a question of whether you are physically strong or not strong.\nBecause you will be totally shadowed if the spirit collapses even a little.

ID=16121001
... I can do it.

ID=16121002
Rather ... I have to do it ...!\nIf blanks are waiting for me ... I also fight against each other ...!

ID=16121003
That stubbornness is ...!\nDo not ask even if you say that it is useless!

ID=16121004
Please stop Tenebris.\nI can not stop%username% even if I raise such a voice.

ID=16121005
Absolutely%username% can not be left in this abnormal space!\nEven if you escape the spot, a blank designer will someday also stimulate the trauma of%username%!

ID=16121006
Someday it will collapse spiritually if that happens!\nAnd%username% is ...!

ID=16121007
Why do you declare that way?\nI do not know anyone yet as to what will happen to me?

ID=16121008
that is ...\nBecause I know well the old figure of%username% ...

ID=16121009
Even if it is blank or "child\\nNo matter what Tenebris says, I will go fight.

ID=16121010
... There really is not a change in mind anymore ...

ID=16121011
I wanted to stop it whatever it was ...\nThere is no choice but to hurt myself who can not do anything with such a body.

ID=56121001
It should definitely work! Please believe me even once!

ID=56121002
People who go well do not trust them.

ID=56121003
Then I wish I could go and see you!

ID=56121004
......

ID=56121005
Please give up already. Even though I can not do anything, my legendary hero like us.

ID=56121006
If I had a fruitful body, I would have stopped it at all costs. It is sad to be this figure like this.

ID=56121007
It should be a tough fight.\nSimply physically, not mentally.

ID=56121008
Even if you think about it, that space is a pitfall where blanks will invite you and reveal desires.\nWith a sense of hesitation, the spirit of%username% is merely polluted by desire.

ID=56121009
I will not ask you even if I say anything.\nWhen you are mentally dangerous, escape unconditionally ... just remember this.

ID=56121010
Yes ... in order to gain the trust of Mr. Tenebris, I can do it perfectly.

ID=26121001
... Thank you.

ID=46121001
Roy ...?\nWhy are you here?

ID=46121002
Oh, yes ... if you think about it, Roy is also a different person so it belongs to the E.S.P troop ...\nDid you come to the blank for your duties ...? I wish had a greeting.

ID=46121003
I am sorry. Suddenly appeared.\n%username% met Amaryllis and was waiting for the real figure to wake up.

ID=46121004
Is ... yes?

ID=46121005
Although it seems that it took longer than expected, I would like to congratulate you from the heart that I regained the body.\nIt was a bit of a hard time to materialize you who was only desire, but there are rewarding things.

ID=46121006
When I got out of the blanks and lost my memory, when I became completely strangely it was serious and rough!\nHahaha, I was giving up when I saw a figure that flew away as saving boring humans.

ID=46121007
If it was not even the woman I guess it was going well more ...\nWhat is it supposed to be because I am not late now?

ID=46121008
Now, I will go.\nI am preparing everything for you to go crazy.

ID=46121009
......?

ID=46121010
What's wrong? Maybe because I have not seen you for a long time, do not you get used to it?\nIf I do not know without trying to move, I will prepare the meat dolls ...

ID=46121011
If you send a bit of information to a foolish Star Forest it will do as usual, hahaha!

ID=46121012
No. That's not it ... I do not know at all what I'm talking about ...

ID=46121013
Oh? Do you even mention%username% as a joke?\nYou were just a "shadow" You drove out fake items and you occupied the body, are not you?

ID=46121014
Mashita ... Is not it deserial side?

ID=46121015
Desirey side ... What do you mean?

ID=46121016
......

ID=46121017
Haha! How! I did not decently check, I talked to my old friend in a mood.\nI am very happy because it is a fighting friend who stamped humans with fun together in the blank ...

ID=46121018
Mistake mistake, do not mind!\nI do not see the extra like me like a complete black curtain! Hahaha!

ID=46121019
Roy san ...? That ...

ID=46121020
Hahaha! I have been touched!\nThis is totally unexpected!

ID=46121021
That "shadow" is the soul spirit itself of Desire Energy.\nEspecially, the mass of desire of%username% was excellent among the many works I have seen.

ID=46121022
Even though I touched your desire a little, it exploded beautifully.\nDesire calls even greater desire. That is why it expands endlessly.

ID=46121023
So it is a providence that 'Shadow' designer is much stronger than weak emotional power like you.\nNo matter who whatever it is, the true desire is a complete body that eroded and dominated human soul energy.

ID=46121024
That's why I listen seriously ...

ID=46121025
Everything ... Why did you like dolls beyond "shadows\

ID=46121026
That Roy san ... No way ...

ID=46121027
Kufu ... ... haha!

ID=46121028
Well, that does not matter.\nThe prepared plan may be distorted somewhat, but it has not ended completely.

ID=46121029
Apparently the work seems to increase.\nAnything planned carefully to pull in%username% has all been wasted.

ID=46121030
Rather than waste ... It seems that it has become considerably troublesome.\nWell, let 's give the win to you guys this time only.

ID=46121031
Let's meet again.\nWhere ... I do not know how it will meet.

ID=36121001
Just a moment ... Please wait ...! What on earth ...

ID=36121002
... Had disappeared.

ID=66131001
I came back,%username%!\nHahaha! This time also fought well!

ID=66131002
Do not close the mouth of the legendary soul worker who was doing a good arms work with this arm!\nOh, it seems just to come, so let's ask! What's wrong?

ID=66131003
... Apparently I seem to have underestimated%username%.

ID=66131004
As you guys,%username% has been growing forever.\nYou should not have to say that you should go home even if you still have a little anxiety.

ID=66131005
Ha ha ha! What is it! Now say something about%username%!

ID=66131006
Me ...! But it is bad, it seems I have to go to Grace City in a hurry!

ID=66131007
Hmm ...? What errands are you, suddenly ...

ID=66131008
There must be some things to check promptly ...!\nI'm sorry, I will remove the seat for a while!

ID=66131009
Oh ... now I can also study the fantasy space.\nThere is no urgent business for the time being. Take care.

ID=66131010
... Did you find anything strange?

ID=66131011
A man who saw it before then suddenly appeared ...\nDetails will be reported after returning!

ID=66131012
Okay, I'm waiting so please go.

ID=16011001
%username%! You came, did not you?\nMy complexion looks bad, but the body is okay ...?

ID=16011002
All right!\nIs my complexion so bad?

ID=16011003
Do I usually work to treat everyone? I'm watching the human face as much as I do.\nNow%username% Well, well ... I have a face with troubles that I can not solve.

ID=16011004
Well, it is the correct answer ...! After all it is amazing!

ID=16011005
Giggle If it is correct, can you tell me what kind of trouble you have?\nMy sister will take care of you at any time!

ID=16011006
... That's right.\nMiriam knows everything ...

ID=16011007
What I only know ...\n... Oh, is that thing?

ID=16011008
My shadow has been left for me forever ...\nEven now it seems I'm aiming for this body ...

ID=16011009
The more you stay in the blank, the stronger you feel that existence.\nI want to fight here forever, I wish I could save everyone ...!

ID=16011010
Of course, once I got over it, that space became meaningless ... but still, I am anxious, it will not change.

ID=16011011
Hmm ... If it is such a serious problem, you'd better ask Tenebus instead of me?

ID=16011012
Even if I say to Tenebris, I'm sure to get mad and be told to leave the blank.\nSo you can not help me here ... Anything is okay for me to find a way to solve it?

ID=16011013
I guess it is wrong if I have to worry about it together ... uh ... well ...

ID=16011014
Why do not you take a break ... a bit?

ID=16011015
It is not much different from Tenebris' s reply ...

ID=16011016
Haha ... may be that, but I still think that's the best.\nTenebris pierced his justice like you ... after all, it was against the human race.

ID=16011017
I'm sure my heart got tired of a long battle.\nIf he had time to rest a little, something might have changed ... I still think.

ID=16011018
So, this is my advice.\nWhat matters to soul workers is more stable than anything else! all right?

ID=56011001
... I agree.\nYou may search for other methods while taking a break for a while, do not you?

ID=56011002
Huh ... So when we are talking about them, I will remember the old days.

ID=56011003
At that time you seemed uneasy and dangerous ... it was a normal weak girl.\nNow it has become a very strong child to protect a lot of people.

ID=56011004
Of course it was not me who brought you up ...\nStill, my heart will be full when I see the child who I rescued has grown so far.

ID=56011005
I never thought that I would be like this.\nI could not imagine watching the fight at that time.

ID=56011006
Well, originally it should have been an ordinary girls high school student ...\nYou often did your best this time. There will be a lot of hard work from now on, but please rest quickly now. all right?

ID=56011007
... Yes!

ID=66011001
%username%! long time no see!

ID=66011002
Long time no see, Benjamin!\nAlways it was only when I had something to do ... I finally got to play!

ID=66011003
I know most of what I have received from reports.\nDo not think about anything here and take a good rest.\nRocotown is the place of rest of those who returned from the blank, and soul workers are no exception.

ID=66011004
Um ... Is Rocotown okay?\nAlthough I heard that dolls will appear even after Edgar ceased to exist ...

ID=66011005
Oh, still a few dolls are still being discovered.\nHowever, compared to the time of the incident, there is little influence on the private sector.

ID=66011006
The situation has recovered to the level where Rue can fully protect the loco town even by Leew.\nThe comparison itself with the tragedy that occurred in Kandusity or Grace City itself is rude.

ID=66011007
I agree ...

ID=66011008
No way, are you going to say you want to fight again?

ID=66011009
When I think that there must be a place that needs my help somewhere, I feel calm ...

ID=66011010
... When you come this far, you doubt that I just want to quarrel under the name of helping people.

ID=66011011
%username%.\nTake a break now and look at the flowers that bloomed in Loco Town.

ID=66011012
Both Candasity and Grace City once had a hard experience, but it is already getting back to original.\nNow the world will not collapse without you going out.

ID=66011013
So ... let's rest now until the time you need your power again.

ID=66011014
Yes, That's right ...

ID=66011015
By the way, Sunny was looking for you.\nYou sure said that you like doctors?

ID=66011016
Is Sunny ...?\nYes! I will be back soon!

ID=46011001
Long time no see,%username%!\nYou came again to Rocotown, I sincerely welcome you!

ID=46011002
Sunny, it's been a long time! How are you?

ID=46011003
Yes. But there are many things to be sent here and there as a member of the Fortune unit.\nFrequently speaking, in Loco Town it is said that injured people are not out much.

ID=46011004
I really appreciate your work ...

ID=46011005
Thanks to Mr. Warren who accepted the village doctor pleasantly,\nI was able to go to a temporary place with confidence.\nI have to give a gift for thank you later.

ID=46011006
It is what I wanted to do. There is no need to thank you.

ID=46011007
Oh, Warren! Hello!

ID=46011008
long time no see.\nI did not think that you were a soul worker.

ID=36011001
Haha ... Miriam was trying to keep it secret,\nIt has become common sense now that everyone knows.

ID=36011002
I just made a fuss about Candas and Grace.\nIf you do not become a celebrity, you should rather doubt the level of information and communication civilization.

ID=36011003
What, unusually, doctors gathered together.\nShall I tell you something?

ID=36011004
Wow ... I am a simple doctor, but is that all right?

ID=36011005
Both the doctor's aspiration and the doctor will feel the same as saving people.

ID=36011006
Rather, I am a doctor I envy%username% to save lots of people.\n... Of course, I also understand that there is suffering accordingly.

ID=16031001
What I would like to hear the most ... Is it eventually in the blank?\nBecause ordinary people like me are prohibited from entering inside of them.

ID=16031002
Miriam did not tell me?\nIf things in the blanks, surely I know more than I am ...

ID=16031003
Oh, that is ... for some reason Miriam does not do anything in the blank.\nWhat happened to Miriam? My face is always dark when I get back from there.

ID=16031004
Well, I heard that my friends are in trouble, but I do not know anything about me.

ID=16031005
Are you worried about friends even in the blank ...\nWell, as for Miriam, it seems to be Miriam.

ID=16031006
Please let me know the situation of the blank than that. What happened to people absorbed?\nHave you not had any previous examples of rescuing survivors?

ID=16031007
Yes ... I'm still looking for survivors.\nSurely, no, surely you can find a living person!

ID=16031008
If you can rescue the blank survivors, you need treatment first.\nAlso the Fortune troops of Locotown will be busy!

ID=16031009
I will be glad to help you if the time comes.\nThere is nothing as challenging as making the most of people!

ID=16031010
Haha, if I also finish the fight someday ...\nFrom Sunny and Warren, I would like you to tell me about the work of the doctor.

ID=16031011
I ... I would like to help those who are hurt than to fight with someone like this ...

ID=16031012
Fuu ... That's right.\nBefore you became a soul worker, it was an ordinary school girl.\nNo matter how strong your body is, you will be mentally unbearable.

ID=16031013
To be honest, I thought that I wanted to quit like this many times.\nBut, as I fight, the figure of people who are being killed by the enemies is reflected in their eyes ...

ID=16031014
I fought more for their revenge and witnessed the same death ...\nWell then we must also have an enemy for those people ...\nEvery time I fight I feel like I am becoming a different person.

ID=16031015
It would be better for me to become a doctor if I walk this life ...

ID=16031016
Hey,%username%. Wait a minute.\n... You seem to have a slight misunderstanding.

ID=16031017
... Huh? What do you mean?

ID=16031018
You said that before? Since past medical school war, field war medicine has changed completely.

ID=16031019
Prior to the war medicine was a gentle study to treat injured people and sick people as the%username% imagined.\nI healed the wounds of people and received the gratitude, so that the doctor's heart can heal ... It was for people and others.

ID=16031020
But modern field medicine ... Do you know what doctors are learning now?

ID=16031021
It is ... same as in the past, healing pain and healing wounds and diseases ...\nIs not it study for people?

ID=16031022
......

ID=16031023
Haa ... it seems to be a much more pure child than it seems.\nThis ... is not it pretty damaging?

ID=16031024
Er, what ... what do you mean?

ID=16031025
Listen carefully,%username%.\nContemporary field war medicine is not as good as you think.

ID=16031026
Sewing the cut arm and legs, you can forcibly revive your breath ...\n... to send it back to the hot battlefield again.

ID=16031027
... Huh?

ID=16031028
Oh, it is what Sunny says.\nField warfare medicine developed dramatically after the war.

ID=16031029
Nonetheless, we can not revive the dead ...\nWe rebuild those who died until we can fight,\nThere is no hardship to drive into the battlefield once again filled with the smell of death.

ID=16031030
Among the patients I underwent ... I was injured till three times,\nAfter healed, some went to the battlefield again and eventually died.\nAt the beginning, he was begging for life alone, he said that in the end he would kill him ...

ID=16031031
Our job is not a gentle job as%username% thinks.\nYour profession called "doctor" has already disappeared.

ID=16031032
... So when I told you I want to be a doctor before, I got angry like that.

ID=16031033
Yes ... If you have knowledge of field medicine, you do not say that you want to become a doctor with a pure face that you do not know anything.\nOnly those who do not have the power to fight will learn how to cure people, just clasp the bandage and go to the battlefield.

ID=16031034
......

ID=16031035
So ... I was envious of%username%.\nIt is not a doctor like me to really help others ... It is a power to stop that war from the beginning.

ID=16031036
%username% has the power to stop the fight.\nI have the power to save men.

ID=16031037
Of course, I do not know what kind of hot feeling you usually do ...\nI wonder if the people who really want to save people are all the same?

ID=16031038
It is many times better that people do not get hurt from the beginning than to treat injured people.\nThat is why your job has much more meaning than our work.

ID=16031039
... I have never thought of such a thing before.

ID=16031040
I ... ... just thinking to avert the enemy for those who died ...

ID=16031041
Of course it is wonderful to fight for those who died.\nBut ... with such feelings when you come into the battlefield, your heart will only get hurt.

ID=16031042
Rather than to regret having passed away ...\nIs not it better to fight with the cause that it is for a lot of people?

ID=56031001
... Yes!\nI feel a little understand what to do!

ID=56031002
Huhu, I got a good face. It was good.

ID=56031003
Then take rest at Loco Town ...\nIf you have the opportunity to see Major Benjamin. It seems like you'd like to leave it to%username%.

ID=56031004
I was saying it was not urgent and I do not need to head in a hurry.\nShall I reply when I stop by?

ID=56031005
No, I'm in a hurry from now!\nPeople in need should immediately help you!

ID=56031006
Huhu, I'm keenly eager, but ... do not fall down to be unreasonable.

ID=66031001
Oh ... no time has passed since the call, but arrival is fast.\nWere you satisfied with the story that you do not mind even after taking a good rest?

ID=66031002
Yes ...! But it's okay!\nI feel like I can do anything now!

ID=66031003
Certainly, my facial expression has become brighter than when I first came to Loco Town.\nDid you have a good story with Sunny?

ID=66031004
I also encountered a bit awful look ...\nAnyway it's okay! Please tell me anything!

ID=66031005
Let's start briefing on the tasks you will impose from now.

ID=66031006
What kind of contents is this time? Would you beat the doll again?

ID=66031007
Killing a doll ... not as far as things are.\nIn the unusual blank space around Locotown there was a sudden enormous energy that can not be usually seen.

ID=66031008
It appeared almost at the same time as you arrived at Locotown.\nIt's as if you were chasing you from the blank.

ID=66031009
I do not want to leave such a job to you who came out from the battlefield to take a rest.\nI certainly feel like I have something to do with you.

ID=66031010
Any relationship with me ...?

ID=66031011
Please investigate directly what is in front of the abnormal whitespace.\nI'm begging you,%username%.

ID=46031001
Mr. Benjamin! I'm back!

ID=36031001
Oh, well came. It was a pain,%username%.

ID=36031002
Um, I found this stuff inside.

ID=36031003
Is it huge energy you sensed beforehand?\nCan I confirm it?

ID=16041001
This energy ... just looking at it makes my eyes hurt.\nWhat on earth is this? Is this the Desire Energy that this was talking about?

ID=16041002
Wonder and I do not feel any sense of incompatibility or fear.\nPerhaps, this power is ...

ID=16041003
Anyway, pass that fragment to the Starry Forest Alliance.\nPerhaps a key to uncover the secret of the blank might be obtained.

ID=16041004
that is ...

ID=16041005
What? Is there also a reason not to give anything?

ID=56041001
I am sorry ... I will investigate this myself.\nSomehow, I feel like leaving it to others.

ID=56041002
If alone ... is there something you think?

ID=56041003
No, it's not like that ... Somehow, I feel like I have been called from somewhere with this piece.\nI have to go ... No, in places that I can not go by ...

ID=56041004
Do you say that you leave it to me for such ambiguous reasons?\n%username% ... You do not seem to be aware of how important your mission is.

ID=56041005
... As a commander it should be said that.\nOur Fortune unit believes you. There is no doubt whatever you decide.

ID=56041006
Oh, thank you ... Benjamin!

ID=56041007
Then it would be better to refrain from reporting to the upper part.\n%username% You should be careful not to talk to others about their fragments lightly.

ID=56041008
The survey team and the discipline team will probably be getting clogged to achieve results.\nIf you are known that you brought valuable goods from anomalous blanks, collection orders will soon come down.

ID=56041009
Yes, I will be careful!

ID=56041010
By the way, where are you going now?

ID=56041011
Well ... once, I'd like to investigate a bit with this piece ...

ID=56041012
I understood. Let's be careful.

ID=26041001
Let's be careful.

ID=66041001
%username%.\nPlease come over here.

ID=66041002
Well, that's about me ... right?\nAh, that ... Hello ...?

ID=66041003
Well, you are a spinner of Eternal history.\nIt seems to have goods today worthy of becoming even more of your history.

ID=66041004
I guess ... is it about this piece of debris?

ID=66041005
That you got in the blank is broken piece with malice of desire ...\nWith this fragment you will be able to reach the place where your essence exists.

ID=66041006
Then you must listen before you face your ugly figure.\n%username% ... Is it really good?

ID=66041007
My essence ... can you go to the place where the child is?

ID=66041008
It is natural for those who have the preparedness to face their own essence.\nIf your full preparedness is conveyed, I will open that path.

ID=66041009
... Please.

ID=66041010
Give the small crystals you have the power to create space.\nPlease talk to me again after a while. It is good?

ID=66041011
Yes, I understand ...

ID=96041001
Sorry to keep you waiting.\nIf you place this piece closest to your own heart, you will be able to reach "the child."

ID=96041002
Er ... What is the closest thing to my mind ...

ID=96041003
It is the brain that creates thoughts ... but it is the heart that creates the mind.\nIf you hold your eyes close to your chest and close your eyes, I think you can reach them easily.

ID=96041004
All right, I understand. I will try it once.

ID=96041005
I wish you a proper history awaits you in the way you walk.

ID=46041001
Oh, you are ...!

ID=46041002
... Why is it such a place ...

ID=46041003
I thought that the voices resembled, but it really is the same figure as me ...\nIt's dark and I can not see it properly, but ...

ID=46041004
Is it like the same figure ... No, now it is the case that you are talking about such a thing.\nWhy did you come here? Why is it no meaning?

ID=46041005
Somehow, it felt like I was called to you.\n... Such a reason, is it strange?

ID=46041006
I did not recall calling. Why do not you go home?

ID=46041007
... I understand that feeling.\nIt's a sad story, but I suddenly came up with a personality.\nThat's why I am manipulating the body ... Well, you should get angry.

ID=46041008
sorry ...\nI did not plan to do such a thing, but you confined you.

ID=46041009
If you feel so sorry,\nWhy do not you just move your mouth and leave here quickly?

ID=46041010
... I am sorry.\nI am worried about what you are doing in the outside world ...

ID=46041011
... After all, it's just a miserable "fake".\nIf you think about others and think about it, you will not be able to take care of yourself.

ID=46041012
Still, this is not close to my original character ...?\nYou are my figure that has changed in 15 years because of the blank ...

ID=46041013
Well, I think like that.\nYou do not mind me. I am not really interested anymore.

ID=46041014
Can you tell us a bit more than that?\nAlthough I was fighting vision before, I could not speak it properly with you ...

ID=46041015
... Hmm!

ID=46041016
I usually do not look for it, but I can talk about it once.\nI also failed to take over the body, for the time being bored.

ID=46041017
Haha ... Thank you.\nThen ... for sure ... are you really me?

ID=46041018
Shall I tell you what happened in the blank if I'm worried?\nI think it will be a very fun story.

ID=46041019
No, that's okay.\nSo why did you come up with such a way of thinking?\nIt is impossible to kill people and lose them all ...

ID=46041020
Are you listening seriously?\nThat power of you got to protect people from the beginning, is not it?

ID=46041021
Power to grow enough to crave revenge ...\nYou ought to know at what time you can be the strongest.

ID=46041022
It is not a weak force to protect boring humans.\nPower to destroy everything in the hatred blanks and blanks, revenge ...

ID=46041023
Whether it is a human or an animal, it does not matter!\nDo not you think it would be better to kill all those that disturb me?

ID=46041024
... It was such a feeling.\nOccasionally I feel a sense of incongruity feeling idly ...

ID=46041025
Hey, who are you trying to contend for?

ID=46041026
Such ... did you forget such a thing?\nIt is my mother. The blank robbed my precious mother?

ID=46041027
I forgot all the anger that I felt by seeing the corpse of a mother shattered in front of my eyes.\nYou ... you were really comfortable.

ID=46041028
What are you talking about ...? My mother is sick ...

ID=46041029
Oh, you do not have a memory?\nSo somehow I was saying that I should help people in the train.

ID=46041030
So you are weak.\nGive that body to me ... as I should, I should use it.

ID=46041031
Er, that is ...! If you say so, you can not translate it obediently.

ID=46041032
Haha, that's right. There is no one to die by being told to die.\nEven if it is a puppet that is used as a good quality weapon by human beings ...?

ID=46041033
... Puppet?

ID=46041034
that's right. Because I lost my memory I guard people without thinking anything?\nDoctors dare to dream and the future as well.

ID=46041035
that is ...

ID=46041036
You should not be able to deny that%username%.

ID=46041037
......

ID=46041038
Then come home already.\nIt is a waste of time to stand here all the time.

ID=46041039
... I will do as you say today.\nI also do not know what I should do ...

ID=46041040
If I find another answer someday, I will come again.\nI will not run away anymore.

ID=36041001
You should do it yourself.\nBecause I am watching you break here.

ID=66051001
%username% ...! Is not there change?

ID=66051002
Oh, yes. I came back safely ...

ID=66051003
I can not believe it suddenly appears before my eyes. What happened?

ID=66051004
Well, well ... well ... suddenly sucked into a strange space, there is a girl like me ...\nIt seemed as if he was talking to myself.

ID=66051005
Mysterious space ... Girls with similar appearances ... It is an unprecedented phenomenon that I do not know.

ID=66051006
If you need further investigation it would be better to ask the Star Forest Alliance.\nIf there is enough room call the survey team ...

ID=66051007
No, this is what I have to solve.\nI'm not convinced, I just feel like that ... I can not trust it to other people.

ID=66051008
Do you mean you do not want help? If you say that you do not want to involve other people ...

ID=66051009
Mr. Benjamin, please ...\nWill not it be kept secret for other people this time alone?

ID=66051010
... That's right. There is no choice if you say so.\nThen, I will give you useful information instead.

ID=66051011
Small anomalous whites you headed to have occurred not only in Loco Town but across Crow Dream.\nIf you need to gather more black fragments, go to other villages and check for a lot of unusual spaces.

ID=66051012
Next is heading to Kandusity.\nYou may be able to find that black chip you got.

ID=66051013
Yes! Thank you, Benjamin!

ID=96051001
Ah ... Aaron, Hello.

ID=96051002
Oh,%username%. You came in a good place.\nI am sorry for being busy, can you listen to my request?

ID=96051003
Well ... yes! If there is something I can help you ...!

ID=96051004
I thought you would say so. [M]\nIt is still a soul worker fighting for the human race.

ID=96051005
Seoul junk was found abundantly in the river area at the outskirts of Candus not otherwise ...\nIf the block can not send down the troops, you are knocking down a few drops.\nWill you go to the block and persuade me?

ID=96051006
Mr. Block ...? What happened?

ID=96051007
I would like to hear it. Why do I ignore the command of the commander suddenly ...\nOf course, I understand that there were various things up to now.\nHowever, it is unreasonable to waive responsibility.

ID=96051008
Certainly ... There is no power left to judge public and private in the near future, because work is up.\nLet's understand the circumstances of the block.

ID=96051009
Anyway, as a soul worker, you are going to be a hero of Kandas city\nIf you persuade, something may change.\nIt is troubling, but I have asked.

ID=96051010
Yes! Please leave it to me!

ID=96051011
I'm begging you. In this way too, Soul junk will spread to Kandusity.

ID=46051001
Block, Hello! Long time no see.

ID=46051002
Oh,%username% ... Long time no see.\nHow have you been? I am not fine, but ... Ahaha ...

ID=36051001
That's right.\nI am sorry that I am tired. Aaron has asked me to do it.

ID=36051002
Colonel Aaron ... ...?\nNo way, it's a story about going to a sweeping strategy ...

ID=16061001
Because Mr. Block does not listen to Aaron's order, I was asked to persuade him.

ID=16061002
As expected ... the command on the outer river area.

ID=16061003
It's just a remote area just soul junk is boiling.\nI can not attack Kandas city from such a far place,\nEven if I sent a soldier I just died of a dog.

ID=16061004
Sorry, then how about trying to tell Aaron as well?

ID=16061005
Do you think you did not tell it? Since I first spoke, I explained that it is dangerous and meaningless plan.\nBut Aaron had no ear to hear.\nThere is soul junk there so do not leave it without annihilation ... just that was it.

ID=16061006
I do not mind being bothered by the soldiers' dissatisfaction, and I will only punish the repelling soldiers.\n... It is a tyrant who thinks nothing of the afterthoughts but just war.

ID=16061007
......

ID=16061008
Victor is the same. He is developing dangerous weapons following the annihilation of Colonel Aaron's soul junk.

ID=16061009
Before this, the area where JVC indiscriminately used radioactive weapons was isolated as it was as a danger area.\nEven so he seemed satisfied because he killed soul junk a lot.

ID=16061010
What on earth do you do ...?\nWhat on earth do I fight to protect the people ...?

ID=16061011
That's right,%username% ... What do you think I should do?

ID=16061012
Sorry, Mr. Block. I do not seem to be able to help you ...

ID=16061013
That's right. It is not a perfect superman who can do anything with soul workers how much.\nA story about the relationship between people and people ... I have worked with them for the longest time I have to solve.

ID=16061014
But, I am not confident ...\nI can only save a couple of people called for strategies just to abandon their lives.

ID=16061015
In the meantime I found that it deleted the soldier information silently from the strategy list and received punishment\n... I can not find a solution.

ID=16061016
... If Katherine were to be there, I could keep operating men with such a thing\nI'm sure you scold me.

ID=16061017
......

ID=16061018
... I'm sorry for stopping. I wanted someone to listen.\nNow you have something else to do? You should go as soon as possible.

ID=16061019
I ... I'm taking a short rest.

ID=56061001
... One day, I will come again. Please wait.

ID=56061002
......

ID=26061001
......

ID=66061001
Oh, it's%username%! It's been a long time sincere!\nI have been waiting forever when you come!

ID=66061002
Do not be surprised when you hear it! This I can burn soul junk\nI developed Napalm! Even the surrounding forests will be a fire with a tremendous flame,\nI can not resist Seoul Junk if it is not that much!

ID=66061003
Haha, this is all because%username% made me realize that!\nIf you do not have%username%, why not make weapons that will annihilate that ugly soul junk\nI could not think about it!

ID=66061004
Um, Victor ...

ID=66061005
Hmm? What,%username%?

ID=66061006
Wow ... I, that ...!\nI do not think the current behavior of Mr. Victor is correct.

ID=66061007
Victor I know is also researching dangerous soul junk affectionately,\nLook for ways to solve peacefully whatever happens ...

ID=66061008
What is it, old talk?\nPlease forget that figure of me at that time.

ID=66061009
I found out what I should do. Now I am researching ways to annihilate Seoul Junk with pleasure.\nIt is a pleasure to see the ugly people asking for help from their lives.

ID=66061010
Even if%username% was fighting in Candas before, was it the same thing?\nYou ought to be able to understand my feelings more than anyone ...

ID=66061011
No ... I changed my mind.

ID=66061012
Of course Soul junk is the enemy of mankind.\nYou must lose it as long as you risk humanity.\nThis feeling is absolutely unchanged.

ID=66061013
Let 's do our best with us!\nWe annihilate Seoul Junk and wage war with the Ned Company with the weapons we got as a result of our research!

ID=66061014
Even if so many people died ...?

ID=66061015
Even if people without innocence get caught up in the battle died ... do not mind?

ID=66061016
That's not what I knew.\nSoul junk has to be annihilated! Sacrifice for that is natural!

ID=66061017
... Huh?

ID=66061018
Catherine is dead anymore ... I can not even bring back life.\nNow I can only do this for Katherine ...

ID=66061019
Do not deny the only purpose I will live ...\nPlease,%username% ...!

ID=66061020
... Mr. Victor has changed ...

ID=66061021
This is the way that I wanted, it is what I wanted!\nDo not disturb my decision ...%username%.

ID=66061022
... I will go now.

ID=66061023
Oh, I understand. Then you should visit the block ...\nI guess she is thinking the same way you are now.

ID=46061001
It was really bad. Everyone should have been stupid to that place ...

ID=46061002
Haha ... that, I know.

ID=46061003
Neither Aaron nor JVC is completely captive in vengeance.\nI can not see my eyes, I can not hear my ears. Just fight to kill if enemies are found ...

ID=46061004
... I also had a similar period.\nI hate everything, grudging ...

ID=46061005
But, now is not it?\nAsking me, you are listening to my story.

ID=46061006
I do not want you to just have%username%.\nAnd someday, always the people of the Kandas branch on the verge of collapse ...

ID=36061001
... No, it is a bit emotional.\n%username%, you are busy, do not you? I can not keep it alive.

ID=16071001
It was bad. I do not mind forgetting my current story.

ID=16071002
No, Mr. Block!\nI will someday ... I want to save the people of Kandusity.

ID=16071003
Now I have a lot of things to do and I will not be able to help you ...\nSomeday I will definitely come back. Please do your best until that time ...!

ID=16071004
... Even words alone, thank you.

ID=16071005
Haha ... Because I will prove that someday, not only words!

ID=16071006
More than that, I'm working now. Colonel Aaron gave an order to convene.\n%username%, you seem to need a job you need.

ID=16071007
I am enough for you because you saw your face.\nDo not worry, head over there.

ID=56071001
Yes, I understand.\nLet's meet again, Mr. Block ... I am sorry that I can not become power.

ID=56071002
... All right.

ID=66071001
Finally came.\nHow is it? Could block convincing?

ID=66071002
No ... It seems like we are a bit tired from various things.\nIt seems a bit difficult to do something right now.

ID=66071003
Well ... Actually, there will be no soldiers who work as hard as Blocks.\nI appreciate that effort and I trust.

ID=66071004
If there are any circumstances, I hope you will tell me ...

ID=66071005
......

ID=66071006
Anyway, I have to take a day off.\nHow about you? It seems to be on vacation, can you help me?

ID=66071007
Yes, there are things I am looking for personally.\nI will do whatever I can to help you!

ID=66071008
I'm not going to monopolize valuable fighting forces that can fight with the whole Crow Dream and the blank ...\nAnomalous blanks appear that cause dangerous energy.

ID=66071009
Anomalous blanks that cause big energy ... ... No way ...! What?

ID=66071010
If left untreated, it will be a big threat.\nIt is where I want to send military force ... It is full of battle with soul junk.\nI heard that, although it seems that Rocotown has solved a similar problem ...\nWill not you help us?

ID=66071011
Yes, I will go! Please leave it to me ...!

ID=66071012
HM? It's ambitious to burn ...\nIs there something to look for there?

ID=66071013
Ahaha ... that is the place.\nThere is a word to tell "her child" ...\nI have to go over there again.

ID=66071014
I do not know what kind of story it is ... it seems I am not involved in an unwillingness.\nI will leave it to you. Please investigate what is there.

ID=46071001
You returned safely. Strong energy that happened inside has not been perceived already.\nDo you know what kind of situation it is?

ID=46071002
That ... ... By abolishing the enemies that were in, energy was also lost?

ID=46071003
(Actually I have that piece of debris,\nI told you that it was better for Benjamin to keep it secret. )

ID=36071001
Anyway the worry has decreased by one ... I thank you for helping me.\nIs there a schedule after this? If possible block again ...

ID=36071002
Um, I'm sorry. Because there is a purpose for hurry, I ...

ID=16081001
Hmm ... Regrettable, it is true that there is no reason to hold you for quite a while.\nI understood. You should leave the block's persuasion to me.

ID=16081002
Ah, Aaron.\nA bit ... can not you change your mindset?

ID=16081003
... Change your mindset? What do you mean?

ID=16081004
But, of course, Mr. Aaron's heart after having Katherine\nI am going to understand as well.\nI also lost reason because of that ...

ID=16081005
I ... I do not want to talk about forgetting what I passed away ...!\nStill, even those who live now because of that ...

ID=16081006
... Is it supposed to happen if you are someone else?

ID=16081007
... Huh?

ID=16081008
Catherine will be at best a good friend for you.\nIf we forget to cry overnight it would be that it was not clean at all ... it was that degree of relationship.

ID=16081009
But for me it is an important girl. Only one family without irreplace ...\nThat girl was all I live for.

ID=16081010
I just told such a story now ...\nDo not you know that it just makes me hard?

ID=16081011
... I'm sorry.

ID=16081012
... It was a hard work today.\nIs there anything else you need to do? Please go home already.

ID=56081001
... I suppose I will be absent.

ID=66081001
I also brought a different 'fragments of desire' ...%username%.\nDo you wish to step into your world again?

ID=66081002
I feel a little depressed ...\nStill, I got the word I want to call on that girl.

ID=66081003
So please do it again.\nPlease let me go over there!

ID=66081004
There is no reason to refuse. Give the small crystals you have the power to create space.\nPlease talk to me again after a while. It is good?

ID=66081005
Yes! Thank you!

ID=96081001
Sorry to keep you waiting.\nIf you place this piece closest to your own heart, you will be able to reach "the child."

ID=96081002
I should embrace it in my chest again ... OK!

ID=96081003
But ... is it really okay?\nYour energy ... history ... everything is shaking strongly.

ID=96081004
... Even so, you can not escape by leaving that girl!

ID=96081005
It is a good preparedness.\nWell then ... I believe you again.

ID=46081001
What, have you come again?\nI was saying to save the world, but it seems to be more free than I thought.

ID=46081002
I have talked to you. Is not it good?

ID=46081003
You know you just bored here all the time?\nYou should love it.

ID=46081004
Er ... I guess it's hard to say.\nDid you say you wanted revenge on the mother 's white space?

ID=46081005
You talk like someone else ...\nNot a stranger ... It is your mother.

ID=46081006
Well, that was it ...

ID=46081007
I feel easy to lose my memory.\n... It is impossible for you someone to understand my feelings.

ID=46081008
... No, I can understand.\nI do not know if I know ... but I also saw an important person dying in front of me.

ID=46081009
No, I do not understand.\nIf you truly feel the same as me ... the body is already mine.

ID=46081010
The essence of the power that Desire Energy gives is "revenge."\nAs long as the partner you are trying to contend is alive,\nWe must fight and fight, we have to fight forever.

ID=46081011
Yet you seem vaguely seeking people and they are not burning at all.\n... You can not understand me like that. definitely.

ID=46081012
It is different.\nFighting and killing, just reviewing it can not solve anything ...!

ID=46081013
... Do you think that revenge is fighting with something important meaning?\nThat's not it. Just kill it until my feeling clears up.

ID=46081014
Even if you pretend to be kind, the essence of that power is revenge ...\nHow much we preach to you so much that you will eventually return your body to me or become a murderer like me.

ID=46081015
That's not it.

ID=46081016
Based on what?

ID=46081017
Of course, I also lost reason in hatred.\nBut ... I looked around the world after a while and found that it was too small.

ID=46081018
Then ... Look at Aaron and Victor,\nI also noticed that if you are attached in the past you can not save people.

ID=46081019
Of course they are poor but ... If it stains in the vengeance heart, I guess it will be like that.\nI can not do anything, just crying ...

ID=46081020
So ... are you gonna stop revenging?\nEven if you lose your feelings that you have supported all of your own, empty?

ID=46081021
Haha ... If you lose all your power, I definitely want to stop fighting and become a doctor.

ID=46081022
Of course, I know that the doctor is too hard and painful.\nBut I still want to help those who are hurt.

ID=46081023
Heh ... Huh, hahaha ...!

ID=46081024
As expected after all ... you were far more stupid than I expected.\nI do not want to admit that this is mine of the past ...

ID=46081025
It seems impossible for me to persuade you directly. Such thought, originally it was not ...\nYou can live your favorite way ... Puppet like you ...

ID=36081001
You and I are different, but the original was the same?\nCan not you understand each other, ...?

ID=36081002
... The exit is behind you, is not it?\nGo out early.

ID=36081003
......

ID=66091001
Oh,%username%!\nWhat kind did you come for today?

ID=66091002
Haha ... I'm in the middle of a slide while I change my mind during my mission.

ID=66091003
It seems that "walk" or ... "dream" is "walking".

ID=66091004
Oh, as usual ...

ID=66091005
Well, I'm still full of the desire to quit this ausan's assistant as ever.

ID=66091006
Were you Senia too?

ID=66091007
Well, I wonder. I can not say yet that the situation has ended since that fuss ...

ID=66091008
It made me messy because of the big fuss ... will not you put some tea? Senior tea.

ID=66091009
I think the general is going to work well if everything stops a joke.

ID=66091010
Ah aha! ! It's cold! It looks like barley with ice!

ID=66091011
Anyway,%username% came here to take a rest?\nIt was exactly right. Grace City is in peace now.

ID=66091012
I can not see the remnants of Rapid Flame, which was troublesome until now.\nIt is uneasy as if such a situation keeps going unemployed.

ID=66091013
Haha ... It is thanks to kicking out the Ned Company that was holding hands with Rapid Flame.

ID=66091014
Ah, that is ...

ID=66091015
Senia, now stop talking about that.

ID=66091016
Yes ...? Oh, sorry. It's nothing.

ID=66091017
Ah ... um, do you have something I should not ask?

ID=66091018
Right now ... but I promise to tell you someday even to you someday.

ID=66091019
If you can be sure of this side, I will tell you everything.\nYou will be busy variously, so you do not want to confuse with undecided information.

ID=66091020
Er ... Well then, I'll be waiting.\nAs Senia says, I still have something to do ...

ID=66091021
The Star Forest Alliance has taken care of and protected\nIt is good to take a rest for a while at Grace City, which boasts and prides.

ID=66091022
Um ... I do not know where Jeremy is.\nI am curious whether my condition has improved or not ...

ID=66091023
Jeremy ...? Oh, I was with that Emilito ...

ID=66091024
Jeremy has been in the hospital since that day and I have been taken care of by Sora.\nI'm sorry ... Jeremy 's condition is not so good, I wonder if it is better not to visit him.

ID=66091025
He does not know anything and continues to talk that soul workers are bad.\nSomeday I will find out how much I am miserable when I have a sense of mind.

ID=66091026
Is that so?\nWell then, I will go to a different place.

ID=66091027
Please be careful,%username%.

ID=96091001
It is%username%. I checked the event in the blank with the report.\nAfter Rapid Flame appeared, I heard that Amaryllis appeared at the same level as the disaster of Candas.

ID=96091002
Yes ... It was a bit tough opponent.

ID=96091003
Amaryllis should be a big "trauma" for you.\nIn the meantime, he worked really well. In conclusion, these words should be spoken.

ID=96091004
But as an evaluation from the same soul worker ... it is the worst option.\nSeoul workers tend to dominate the spirit by their power.\nIf you were doing a runaway, hard work would have happened.

ID=96091005
It was for you and the people to escape on the spot.\n... Remember also that there are times when it is best to get away from now.

ID=96091006
... I will be careful.

ID=96091007
Anyway, I've solved it safely. Even if I say such a thing, it will only be an extra little say.\nI also care about what is in the blanks ... I wonder if I change the topic.

ID=96091008
What did you see there? If you were moving on the actual site,\nYou know more than the contents of the report?

ID=96091009
It seems better to consult Kane Barrel ...

ID=96091010
Mr. Kane Barrel, what kind of image do you designer energy?

ID=96091011
Desireia Energy ... To guess from the energy felt during battle with Vesi,\nI guess it was so ugly.

ID=96091012
Unlike Seoul Energy based on "emotions" that encompasses everything,\nDesire moves just under "desire".\nWe do not care about any means for our purpose, others' lives ... sometimes even my own life\nIt is a dangerous force that lightly throws away.

ID=96091013
If you do a more intuitive analogy ... Rapid Flame with power desire is wild\nWhile repeating body evolution, I respect Queen's and the king's lives like their own honor\nThe Vesi of Nikhil Kingdom began to seek armor resembling a shield.

ID=96091014
Evolution and living of Vesi are determined by Desire Energy.\nYou should think so.

ID=96091015
Then ... If that is a bad thing, do you think it should disappear unconditionally?

ID=96091016
... I see.\nFrom here onwards is a personal idea. Do not worry too much.

ID=96091017
Actually, I ... I do not think it is unconditionally bad to say that Designer Energy is a thing of Vesi.\nWhat is wrong is the heart of those who use that energy. Energy changes depending on the user.

ID=96091018
Seoul and Desire are fundamentally the same energy.\nHowever, the designer is more pure and selfish ... just that.

ID=96091019
... I agree. Desire is just pure ...\nThen, "That girl" also ...

ID=96091020
I do not know why I suddenly have a serious face, but I just said a personal opinion as the same soul worker.\nDesigner and Vesi are defined as enemies by the Star Forest Association.\nThere is no need to worry about fighting with them.

ID=96091021
But it is not that a person with bad energy is unconditionally bad ... is not it?

ID=96091022
Of course, whether it be a Besshi or a human being, you can negotiate as much as you can discuss.\nThat was a matter of course only ten years ago.

ID=96091023
That's right ... then, even to that girl ...

ID=96091024
That's right ...!\nThank you, Kane Barrel! Thanks to that, I got a little confidence!

ID=96091025
Confidence ...?\nWhat do you mean?

ID=96091026
I am confident that I will talk face to face with that girl straight!

ID=96091027
... I do not understand well, but better than anything if I can become a force.

ID=96091029
Hey! What? wait a minute! I have not heard of things in the blank yet ...!\n... have you gone already?

ID=86091001
Oh,%username%! Here it is! here!

ID=86091002
Hello! What's wrong?

ID=86091003
There are some people I want to introduce to you!\nLaban! Come here!

ID=86091004
Laban ... I will go ...

ID=86091005
This person ... ... No way! What?

ID=86091006
Err said! It is Laban, Laban!\nIt is a near soul worker who was at Ned Company's underground base!

ID=86091007
Near soul worker ... One person was alive.\nHaving been able to walk outside like having already solved brainwashing?

ID=86091008
Oh, no ... I have tried it variously, but it is quite difficult.\nEven now, he does not bother listening to not managing Henry's tone.

ID=86091009
Well, why is Henry's voice tone ...! What?

ID=86091010
I do not want to imitate the voice and tone of such an uncle!\nBut ... It's because of brainwashing strongly carved in Laban's brain, still Henry is my own\nThere is no change in recognition.

ID=86091011
Well, now the brainwashing is solved to some extent.\nIt is a happy unfortunate that you just follow the tone and follow it!

ID=86091012
......

ID=86091013
Oh, Laban! Do not look it because it's a dog's shit!

ID=86091014
Dog's feces ... discharge ... dirty things ...\nLaban ... dirt ... is eliminated ...

ID=86091015
It is no good! Do not touch dirt on your own! this is an order!

ID=86091016
Labin ... I will follow the order ...

ID=86091017
Haha ... seems tough.\nAre you under rehabilitation right now?

ID=86091018
Yes. If you do not go for a walk like this,\nI will have muscle pain when I get active in the future.

ID=86091019
I mean, how is it! What?\nIf you do this, do not look a bit like a date! What? Err said!

ID=86091020
What? Only looking at the dogs for a walk ...

ID=86091021
I know. I also knew.\nTherefore, please do not let me dare to feel sad ...

ID=86091022
Haha ... surely if you can unravel the brainwashing,\nI think that he will give back to Sora.

ID=86091023
That would be fine, but anyway, I have a use so here!\nPlease also do your best at%username%!

ID=46091001
Are you enjoying your vacation? Did you feel better?

ID=46091002
Yes! After all the blue sky is the easiest to walk ...

ID=46091003
Even though there was such a thing ... Everyone is living as hard as he did not have anything.

ID=46091004
Grace City is said to be a symbol of peace even in Crow Dream.\nIf such a city is desperate for one reason, why can not it be an example of another city?

ID=46091005
But ... to be honest, I am a little scared.\nIt was as if the dead were not from the beginning.

ID=46091006
I forgot everything that passed and it seems that we could just laugh like this ...

ID=46091007
... Yes, it is a reasonable doubt as a human being who lives with the world peace.

ID=46091008
%username%. Is there time to talk a little?

ID=46091009
Huh ...? Oh, yes! Of course.

ID=36091001
Hmm ... just like Senia seems to be busy for other purposes, it's a good opportunity.\nI will talk a little seriously.

ID=16101001
So, first of all, I have one question.\n%username% Do you think my parents are still alive?

ID=16101002
Yes ...! What? Um, that ... ... Yes, I think I 'm still alive.

ID=16101003
Ha ha ha! That means I look young! What?

ID=16101004
Ah ... um ... haha, haha ​​...

ID=16101007
Well, please think that it is a light joke before entering the subject.\nI am a character that can not keep on serious stories for over five minutes.

ID=16101008
I see, I see ...

ID=16101009
As I said earlier, I lost my parents five years ago.\nBoth of them are soldiers of the Starry Forest Alliance. In Battle of Grace he fought with Vesi and was killed in battle.

ID=16101010
Was it sad? Where are those who did not feel sad when their parents who raised them died.\nMoreover, he was not dead easily, he died while suffering in the battlefield. The impact was quite big.

ID=16101011
Then, let's issue one problem here.\nDaddy Guy who lost parents and grieved in disappointment, which is the road that Thor chose?

ID=16101012
I killed indiscriminately the Vechi and the soul junk who killed the parents the most.\nSecondly, I find the crowd who killed my parents to death and somehow steal the enemy.

ID=16101013
And the third, returning to its former figure as if nothing had happened.

ID=16101014
... Third, I think.

ID=16101015
Yes, it's third.\nWhile suppressing my regret and anger in the heart that is likely to bite with pain and the brain that is about to explode\nBecause I ordered documents in the command room as usual ...

ID=16101016
And the next day I went to the battlefield as usual and kept people.

ID=16101017
%username%, what do you think of me taking such action?\nA cold-blooded man who abandoned his parents' passion? Or is it a wise commander?

ID=16101018
that is ...

ID=16101019
We have to protect in front of our eyes, there is no time to hesitate, as there are people who have to help.\nIt is because it may hurt even those who were able to protect them if they were caught in the past.

ID=16101020
Why do you think evil trying to forget people who died?\nRather, it is courage to overcome it and make the future together with people.

ID=16101021
Tears should flow in the futon before going to sleep.\nThere is no time of sorrow any more here where it became a battlefield.

ID=16101022
Grace City people in front of you are never ruthless so you do not have to look back on the past.\nRather than trying to compare each other, we are trying to cut off the sad past.

ID=56101001
Because each other thinks each other ...

ID=56101002
It may still be a cruel story to the student's owner.\nNo, of course it is a cruel story by anyone.

ID=56101003
However, even if it is so, it is a veil that is deeply carved into the heart.\nEven as we play the heroine of tragedy as this world became a battlefield\nThere is no one who will cry tears.

ID=56101004
It is only people who wipe away the tears, shatter the past and run forward.\nDo you understand?

ID=56101005
... Yes, I understand.

ID=56101006
Well, it seems that the trouble has been solved for a while.\nThe advice of Dundee Guy this time is very important, be sure to tip it in your mind.\nSenia who is standing there will also be with you!

ID=56101007
If you think what you are talking about with rare serious look ...\nTo see where the talk for justice is going to be so long, the captain has gotten too old.

ID=56101008
Cut ...! Stop! My heart is still a teenager!

ID=56101009
Do not worry too much about the grandfather's story there.\nI am crying when I want to cry, but I definitely do not cry\n... I do not really know the mindset.

ID=56101010
No ... rather than me, Thor san seems to have found the correct answer.

ID=56101011
Perhaps, even to that girl ...\nSenior! Thor! Is there any place where abnormal voids occurred near here?

ID=56101012
Huh? I just received a report on abnormal space from the subordinates just before ...

ID=56101013
I will go! There are things I have to do!

ID=56101014
I will not stop if I want to go so much ...\nAre you okay? You were on vacation away from the blank?

ID=56101015
It's okay! If you have any information on abnormal blanks, I will head right away!

ID=26101001
I hope you find it useful. You must do your best.

ID=46101001
I've been handling it wonderfully.\nWas there something unique?

ID=36101001
Oh, that is ... Well ...!\nThe enemy was strong and struggled hard, but everyone exterminated!

ID=36101002
(Thor, I'm sorry ... Because it's a secret ... ...)

ID=16111001
Gracia City became quiet again thanks to your guardian!\nIt's quiet and it's okay even if you do not have ears!

ID=16111002
There is no ear and you can hear nothing!\nAhahahahahahaha!

ID=16111003
Please do not do such a thing with that face!\nI will be taken to prison due to an offense violent crime!

ID=16111004
Chicho, Senior, I feel like beating me! What? I can not afford it!

ID=16111005
Do not be such an adult,%username%.\n... No, that is not a child but a child. It is good to remember it.

ID=56111001
Haha, I'm in a good mood so let me forgive you ...

ID=56111002
Every time my mood gets better I feel I'm getting worse ...

ID=56111003
Um ... I have something to do. I have to go soon ...

ID=56111004
Oh! I do not want to thank you enough, but I feel like having a treat like rice.\nAre you busy so much?

ID=56111005
Yes, I'm sorry.\n... There is always a story I want to tell you this time.

ID=66111001
I also brought a different 'fragments of desire' ...%username%.\nWould you also wish to step into your world this time?

ID=66111002
Yes ...!\nThis time ... This is what I will tell you everything I want to say!

ID=66111003
Huh ... I feel shinier than usual.\nThe path of your walking history will surely shine with similar light.

ID=66111004
I will gladly make your wish fulfilled this time.\nPlease wait a while and call on me again.

ID=66111005
Yes! Thank you!

ID=96111001
Sorry I made you wait.\nPlease get rid of everything you care about this time.

ID=96111002
Now is the time to stand up again. A new history that can not be predicted will appear before you.\nI am looking forward to it.

ID=96111003
Um, I do not know well though it is difficult ...\nWell, I'm going!

ID=96111004
I pray that your path will be the right history.

ID=46111001
I told you it was a waste of time ... have you come again?\nYou seem to be really leisure?

ID=46111002
Moreover, to see a confident mysterious expression ... Apparently it seems to be troublesome this time.

ID=46111003
I came again because there was something I wanted to ask you.\nCan you speak a little, just a little?

ID=46111004
... Try it.

ID=46111005
Do you think that fighting for revenge will benefit himself?

ID=46111006
If you think what to say ...\nIt's a waste of time if you come to talk about whether it is right or wrong.

ID=46111007
That's not it ...!\n... No, I think that I had various circumstances in my old days.

ID=46111008
But, I stuck to the past that passed already, I suffered alone ...\nIf it is your goal to hurt someone else after all it's hot and painful ... it's wrong.

ID=46111009
Is it natural that I will retaliate, because I had a hard time?\nI can not bear only to suffer ... I got the power I got.

ID=46111010
Do you have someone you want to get revenged for?\nThat girl ... those who killed Catherine. Do not you want to kill them all?

ID=46111011
Revenge is an absolute necessity to make you strong.\nIf I said such a thing now, you have no sense of fighting any more ...!

ID=46111012
Designer Energy will no longer give power if the meaning to fight is gone.\nAre you planning to forget your "revenge"?

ID=46111013
Then I am! I do not need reasons to fight ...!

ID=46111014
......

ID=46111015
I also saw a lot of people dying in front of me.\nOf course, there are lots of feelings I want to take revenge!

ID=46111016
But ... that's because other people are together.\nThere are many people who lost valued people besides me!

ID=46111017
I just do not want to live like a heroine of a tragedy.\nI pretend to be a poor person, I do not want to be sympathized ...!

ID=46111018
Stop kidding me! !\nI've forgotten everything so I can heal such a silly thing!

ID=46111019
Lost memory without permission ...\nTalk as if everything what you are talking about is all right!

ID=46111020
No. You and I ... are neither counterfeit.\nI think so ...

ID=46111021
It may be that I have a personality later than I was ...\nStill, are we two people the same person?

ID=46111022
Same human ...? On what grounds can you say such a thing?

ID=46111023
Everything between you and I ... It has a different memory, I got a different experience.\nEven trying to persuade me now ...!

ID=46111024
A long time ago ... what was your longstanding dream?\nWhat kind of person did you want to be?

ID=46111025
... What are you sudden?

ID=46111026
It is a dream of the future.\nIs not it? When I was in elementary school, I put up my chest in front of the blackboard and announced to everyone ...

ID=46111027
......

ID=46111028
I wanted to help everyone ...\nI wanted to be a doctor ...

ID=46111029
don't you\nI am the same. I wanted to be a doctor forever!

ID=46111030
... It is just an old tale now.\nRather than helping people, kill a lot of people for revenge ... I will do so from now on.

ID=46111031
why? It is not a bad thing to talk about a dream!\nYou just ... just walked a little wrong way.

ID=46111032
I cherished people and family around me, so I thought that revenge was born?\nNeither feeling I wanted to protect my mother becoming a doctor.

ID=46111033
... so? So what?

ID=46111034
You can still help people, you can protect.\nIt may be too late to see a dream of becoming a doctor ... I think I can help and protect in another way.

ID=46111035
That is ... different from doing "revenge" like you, in a different way.

ID=46111036
Noisy noisy ...

ID=46111037
In doing so promise unilaterally ...\nTalk about it as if everything is right ...!

ID=46111038
I do not mean to say that I am right.\nAnyway, your way is because I chose the same person as you.

ID=46111039
But now the world has changed.\nI also have a lot of people who want to help but also have to help them.

ID=46111040
Of course I also wanted revenge desperately.\nThere are many things I thought that I wanted to destroy everything.

ID=46111041
But now ... than the face of the people who died while suffering,\nI think I want to remember the faces of those who will help from now.

ID=46111042
Yes ... I see ...\nAlready, I will throw away my revenge heart ...

ID=46111043
... Yup.

ID=46111044
Even if you lose all the power you had ...?

ID=46111045
If that happens ...\nI am planning to teach Mr. Sunny in field town care at Locotown!

ID=46111046
Haha ... I see ...\nYou are already filled with "something different from me" ...

ID=46111047
I do not have any gaps where I can enter ...\n... So do not yield to visions.

ID=46111048
From now on, I feel like I have no whereabouts.\nYou have something else besides 'revenge'.

ID=46111049
sorry ...\nBut, as you said, I will not give up on this form of present.

ID=46111050
Do not pretend to be gentle this time ... Anyway you will not obsess with revenge anymore.\nAs long as you do not make my whereabouts, I will eventually be treated fake and thrown away.

ID=46111051
Either one carries the crime of living in this ugly space.

ID=46111052
Still ... sorry feeling is true ...

ID=46111053
enough! I am not interested in your body any longer!\nIf you decide how to live on your own, you should do just that!

ID=46111054
To persuade a fool like you, it was troublesome to go out and go out of control.\nI do not do anything here because I just live my life ...

ID=46111055
I will do it for you ...!

ID=46111056
... what?

ID=46111057
I guess I lost my mother because of the blank ...?\nSo you want revenge?

ID=46111058
I have no such memory and I can not sympathize with you ...\nStill I will do my best to eliminate the blank you hate.

ID=46111059
I can tell anyone if it's just a mouth.\nIf it is possible to eliminate the space, this world should have become peace long ago.

ID=46111060
I decided to do so and that goal would be enough.\nDo not forget that you are here ... Fight instead of you!

ID=46111061
I think I'm really lonely here forever ...\nStill, I want you to wait without hoping for hope.\nBecause your "revenge" will come true!

ID=46111062
... I'm more motivated than ever ... it is like that now.

ID=46111063
Oh, it's OK. I am irritated when talking to you.\nIt's pointless, it does not change anything ...

ID=46111064
You can live as you like.\n... I'm watching here whether the road was really right or not.

ID=36111001
... Let's meet again.

ID=15902001
There will be nothing I do not know.\nDo whatever, remember!

ID=15902002
A lot of things happened from one to the next, I do not remember anything!\nYou saw something through the screen, are not you?

ID=15902003
I could see%username% collapsing if I thought that something glowed, but that's it.

ID=15902004
I was the same! If you think that it shines brightly ...!\nOh, I really do not know ...

ID=15902005
Anyway, where did Noa and Enok go?\nA guy with a strange hairstyle, too!

ID=15902006
do not know. Even if I keep tracking if I understand it.\nSo how's Sarah sighing?

ID=15902007
Do not ask me.\nIt is serious that an accident happens all over the world now.

ID=15902008
...? Is there another problem occurring?

ID=15902009
After the woman of Zion and gold armor disappeared, abnormal phenomena occurred suddenly throughout Crow Dream.\nPerhaps, it's a bad situation.

ID=15902010
Is that ... right?\nIt is because of us ... not it?

ID=15902011
We just followed the order of the upper part.\n... But there is plenty of possibility to bear the responsibility.

ID=15902012
Haha ... I'm used to being touched with responsibility.\nIn the worst case, I will tell the members of the research team not to discipline.\nAlthough accusations are inevitable, they will not lose their workplace.

ID=15902013
It will be saved ... It will be a big problem if you lose the laboratory.

ID=15902014
What should I do? Should I also look for a near soul worker from the beginning?

ID=15902015
In place of me I want to lower my head in front of a great man ... I want to say,\nTo ask such a thing for Seoul workers is a waste of talented talent.

ID=15902016
Dig Digs who ramped up to raise Zion also completely stopped functioning,\nThe reaction of a mysterious woman who appeared suddenly disappeared with the near soul worker.

ID=15902017
Unlike other areas, this place is quiet as never as before and no problems have arisen.\nIn this situation it is said that we are asking%username% from ....

ID=15902018
Both Zion and that woman disappeared arbitrarily ....\nI thought he was me.

ID=15902019
... Were not you scared in such a place?\nIt looks rather regrettable though.

ID=15902020
I'm sorry I'm sorry to be sorry.\nIt has been since Candus.

ID=15902021
Do not be depressed so much.\nIf you live in that situation and you can come back, it is good.

ID=15902022
I know Sion, but nobody was able to anticipate that a woman who would retreat it in an instant would appear.\nNo one blames%username%.

ID=15902023
Be careful.

ID=15902024
That's right ... How about going to Amanda's place?

ID=15902025
I was running around here with a rough appearance from a little while ago.\nPerhaps it got something important. Go and ask.

ID=55902001
roger that! I will come back soon Please wait a while!

ID=55902002
I am sorry to have asked such a thing.\nI am also busy writing a report to excuse my great men.

ID=25902001
Please go to Dr. Sarah and Amanda. There may be some clues.

ID=65902001
I, return safely!\nAmanda Hey you who was deeply impressed by the survival of the miracle Is it still hot embrace?

ID=65902002
I did not feel like that, but it has disappeared.

ID=65902003
Hahah, that is the only thing Amanda!\nI thought it was bad but after such a thing happened, I wanted to relax a bit with Amanda 's cold eyes.

ID=65902004
I understand. I also seriously worried whether workers' compensation will be applied if the soul workers died during battle.

ID=65902005
You can not go fancy with a joke ...\n... Anyways. What is it that you can you tell me about the current situation?

ID=65902006
Well, which one should I speak from ...\nTo put it briefly, the world is fussing now. It is serious that requests for assistance come from everywhere.

ID=65902007
From all over the world ...? Did the incident happen again?

ID=65902008
It is abnormal white space.

ID=65902009
Since the reaction of Zion has disappeared, abnormal whites appearing all over the world are activating activities.\nThe reaction of the near soul worker who tried pursuit also disappeared perfectly and I can no longer hand them to them.

ID=65902010
Do you mean to give up tracking of near soul workers?

ID=65902011
I check the reaction at any time, but nothing is reacting.\nIf you try to search without any information, you just think you will waste time?

ID=65902012
Chi, the hero who saves the world can not do what he wants to do.

ID=65902013
... I know how I feel.

ID=65902014
Thank you, I will ask Mr. Sala again.

ID=95902001
Did you hear the news that anomalous space appeared from Amanda?

ID=95902002
I heard that it is a crisis of world peace.\nThis time it's pretty serious?

ID=95902003
Well, there are cases in the past that blanks are opened all at once,\nIt has been hardly active recently, but it was not rare a couple of years ago.

ID=95902004
But the nature of the blank confirmed this time is different.\nSo now, in the Star Forest Union we are investigating the blank by calling it "ideal blank".

ID=95902005
The traits are different?

ID=95902006
I can freely go in and out.

ID=95902007
Wow ... that sounds interesting.

ID=95902008
Common blanks suck humans inside and there is no way to escape?\nAnd there are side effects that people who come out of the blanks lose their memory.

ID=95902009
That freely comes in and out of the anomalous empty spaces that have emerged this time.\nIt can be said that it is not a white hole and a black hole but a gate or a passage connecting here and a blank inside.

ID=95902010
Thanks to you, the Starry Forest Alliance is currently fussing inside.\nIt seems that we may be able to finish the disaster of 15 years this time, and organize a dedicated team to investigate abnormal blanks at once.

ID=95902011
Do you think that Noah and Enok are also there?

ID=95902012
I am not sure, but probably not.\nThere is no report that abnormal whites occurred around here, so it will not be sucked in.

ID=95902013
Really ....

ID=95902014
What are you going to do?\nAre you going to search for the near soul worker who disappeared here for a long time, or are going to investigate abnormal empty space?

ID=95902015
You do not have to ask it, do you? Once I've started it's the man who can finish it to the end!

ID=95902016
Hehe, I thought he would say so.\nThen stay with Ruin Fortress and stay with me ...

ID=95902017
Sorry, it looks like you can not stay here.

ID=95902018
What a sudden it appeared.

ID=95902019
No way, another task was given ...?

ID=95902020
I also heard about a while ago, but the majority of the searching forces here are scheduled to be organized into abnormal blank entry troops.

ID=95902021
Probably, Near soul worker tracking is judged to be unsuccessful and it will be to give a new job.\nHahahaha, after all the great people seem to be accustomed to using excess personnel.

ID=95902023
Why "Do you think so?" Listen to what I mean!\nLet 's go after it tidy up firmly.

ID=95902024
I am not going to go too.\nIt is sort of like going all the way to go killing to go scouting in a blank space that you do not know what will happen.

ID=95902025
I am fine in the research field, but this person is absolutely obedient to the order.

ID=95902026
More than that, although peace is about to be disturbed by the appearance of abnormal whites,\nDo you intend to abandon the crisis of humanity to find the children you do not know where you are?

ID=95902027
Chit, do you say that?

ID=95902028
Thank you for your cooperation.\nHow about Dr. Sarah together? Is the space itself the energy that Dr. Sarah studies?

ID=95902029
Of course it looks interesting, but I'm interested in the energy hidden here.\nBesides, unlike Amanda, you are incompetent.

ID=95902030
all right. It is impossible to forcibly take the ordinary people who do not want to go to drift.

ID=95902031
Let us suppose that we will go to work.\nIt seems that abnormal blank space is near Rocotown, so it is confluent on site.

ID=45902001
Oh,%username%! Long time no see, eh!

ID=45902002
Miriam Oden, it's been a long time! Right now, what are your plans for tonight?

ID=45902003
Ah ... well, it does not change.\nI wonder if it is better to say cool as ever?

ID=35902001
It does not change anything!\nLook it up! Do not you feel like something changed? Well, atmosphere!

ID=35902002
Well ... Well ... your skin got a little cleaner ...?

ID=35902003
If you do not know, you do not have to force yourself ...

ID=15912001
Anyway, it was just right timing. It is a big fuss during Locotown due to the recently generated blank.

ID=15912002
Can you see that blank floating in the sky of Locotown?\nIt is an order of magnitude larger than neighboring blanks.

ID=15912003
That place ... where I came out ...

ID=15912004
Recently, the phenomenal blanks have just started to revitalize suddenly.\nNot only that, it seems possible to enter and leave freely according to the research team's report.

ID=15912005
Thanks to everyone in Rocotown evacuating urgently ...\nOn the contrary, E.S. P, a fortified person unit of the Star Forest Alliance, is gathered at Locotown.

ID=15912006
Perhaps, you may know the secret of the blank?\nIf I understand everything before I see it, I do not have any fun to adventure.

ID=15912007
I do not know yet ...\nWe are going to investigate from now on by the disabled people of the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=15912008
Okay, I got touched up for the work I had done, but I got motivated for a moment.\nLet's go into the blanks!

ID=15912009
Haha, I thought you would say so.\nFortune troops are not ready yet, so I will be going back later.

ID=55912001
Well then, I will go ahead and research a sunny date spot!

ID=55912002
I will tell you earlier, but I think I'm too busy getting in and I can not have the time ....

ID=55912003
Can you make room to play too? Okay!

ID=55912004
Haha ... well I can afford it ...

ID=55912005
%username% ... Are you not afraid of you?\nYou may fight unknown enemies in places you do not know at all ...

ID=55912006
Well ... Well, I just played with a girl who was about to destroy the world,\nIt is strange that you are afraid of that extent at this time.

ID=55912007
... Yeah, I see. That's good.

ID=55912008
I do not know what's inside of it, so be careful.\nWe forget Fortune troops as soon as preparation is completed.

ID=25912001
I will follow you as soon as preparation is completed. Do not push yourself too much, do you? What?

ID=65912001
You came, I'm glad.

ID=65912002
... It is a man who will be delighted at first when you arrive.\nNo doubt you will also serve as a commander?

ID=65912003
I was acclaimed for competence from the upper part and was appointed commander of the abnormal blank search team.\nIt seems to me that the manager of the Human Resources Division has written a recommendation letter for every 10 pages of paper by handwriting.

ID=65912004
Does that mean ... You know you were pressed by the most convenient?

ID=65912005
Hahaha, it's the same as before, so you do not understand?\nAlthough it is a blank search of ambiguity what to do, it is white at the time of appointing only the commander quickly.

ID=65912006
The personnel section manager should organize competent research forces at a tremendous speed.\nIt was the first time that he was so ambitious.

ID=65912007
Of course, we will continue to manage the survey team in Ruin Fortress, so it will come and go both places.\nPerhaps when%username% comes to Ruin Fortress, I guess I'll be there, too.

ID=65912008
Great ...\nI can throw my resignation and go on a trip.

ID=65912009
Hahaha is in a position to receive instructions from an incompetent superior, but if you can withstand it, there is nothing in return.\nNo matter who you say, there is no precedent for being promoted to this position at this age.

ID=65912010
I will tell this story of the adult world to this place, it will be about to come to the point.

ID=65912011
If you ask anything, I'd rather ask a man from a beautiful lady, not a man?

ID=65912012
Do not say such a thing, there is no one else who can explain it.

ID=65912013
Well then! Because I will investigate myself directly.\nIt seems fun to adventure the blank!

ID=65912014
To inspect directly ... Are you going to investigate immediately?\nIt would be nice to take a rest for a while, so it would have been hard to come so far.

ID=65912015
It is not a tired body.\nI'm going for a walk for a walk!

ID=65912016
... Do not you know this scary thing?

ID=65912017
I thought like it, but it looks like I'm really enjoying it.\nYou are fine as if you were chasing a woman's ass.

ID=65912018
Certainly, I thought that I was strange.

ID=65912019
Although the near soul worker should have disappeared and felt depressed, I felt suddenly the heart beat faster quickly when I entered here.\nI do not feel calm.

ID=65912020
Is not it personality that I can not bear to be boring though?\nWell, when%username% comes into the investigation earlier, it is a great help as it is here.

ID=65912021
Still, do not you think you are trying to solve everything by yourself?\nBecause the Star Forest Alliance is dispatching E.S. P, a force with different force.

ID=65912022
Different force unit? What is that great, is not it?

ID=65912023
Although it is inferior compared to%username%, it is the strongest unit of mankind.

ID=65912024
Well, for the time being, I will do what I want.\nWhile properly fighting, please let me know if there is something.

ID=65912025
Oops, there was something more important than fighting.\nTalk with Amanda who is here with me!

ID=65912026
Oh, Amanda, are you also here?

ID=65912027
I forcefully pulled saying I do not want to come.\nIf I do not see the beautiful body of Amanda, motivation does not occur.

ID=65912028
Haha, I know that man! That honest story, I liked it!

ID=65912029
What, in fact, there were no other communication soldiers available, so I just brought some talented people.\nI am incompetent, but only the eyes that see the person are certain.

ID=65912030
Alright, I'm going to say hello! Please do something if you have a job?

ID=65912031
I am preparing a lot of work and waiting.

ID=95912001
Huh

ID=95912002
Hmm? Is it something painful? Shall I consult you?

ID=95912003
No ... I just curse my destiny.

ID=95912005
I think humans are consumables.\nI am measuring the limits of my patience.

ID=95912006
Oops ... things were soooo crowded ......

ID=95912007
I will do things that is good at personnel evaluation, if I do not have words, I will quit instantly and live quietly in the corner of the room.\nI do not think I'm too competent ...

ID=95912008
But compared to the work of%username% ....\nIt was not a thing to say in front of a person fighting on the job at the work place, I am sorry.

ID=95912009
Ah! I will do my best, so let's work hard together!

ID=95912010
...%username% does not say I'm not at all frustrated.\nI am not in a position to say honestly to other people, but both soul workers and experts are too good.

ID=95912011
I just do what I want to do.\nWhy is not word good for good?

ID=95912012
If the result according to that feeling saves the world,\nThe conclusion is good and does not change.

ID=95912013
Certainly, is that so?

ID=95912014
Still, not fighting for the peace of mankind or something like that.\n... But I just do not want to see where someone will die in the presence of my eyes.

ID=95912015
That's enough.\nI am fighting for those without power.

ID=95912016
By the way did you try talking to someone over there?

ID=95912017
I do not know who it is, but it seems that girls do not remain in my memory is not a girl.

ID=95912018
That's right.\nThe strongest soul worker, Teneburis, who appeared suddenly ten years ago and bounced back the force of Vesi ... I do not know if he is himself or not, but in fact it should be a great strength in the Starry Forest Alliance.

ID=95912019
Is he such a great guy?\nI'm not interested in such noiseless fuss.

ID=95912020
You always ... nothing.

ID=95912021
Oh, by the way it seems I know%username%, but have you talked before?

ID=95912022
Well, I do not know at all? Well, if you know a man, I will delete it from my memory.

ID=95912023
You forgot all the memories in the blank?\nThat man, I have a memory in the blank that we forgot.

ID=95912024
... It's a little anxious.

ID=95912025
Is not it? It seems I was looking for you, so please go once.

ID=45912001
Hello! An old man looking at the mountain while sticking on the roadside?\nI tried to come because I heard you're looking for me!

ID=45912002
......

ID=45912003
... Please do not pretend not to hear me, reply.

ID=45912004
......

ID=45912005
Hey ...

ID=45912006
What happened ... ...

ID=45912007
Huh? What, what! What?

ID=35912001
You know Halle Estiah!\nShe ... ... where are you!

ID=15922001
Hull ... I do not know who it is, but I feel like a cute little girl name somehow!

ID=15922002
That word, it sounds as if she does not know her.

ID=15922003
I would rather like to know? Can you introduce me later?

ID=15922004
Please do not be blurred! You who did act at her nearest, you will not mind knowing!

ID=15922005
I do not know what people are losing among people, but please disappear from here right now!\nThis place is not the place where you are.

ID=15922006
What a sudden. Are you in a bad mood?

ID=15922007
I do not wonder why he is in such a bad mood,\nChoosing me as the opponent for everything is going to be troublesome.

ID=15922008
......

ID=15922009
......

ID=15922010
Really ... seems like I do not know.

ID=15922011
Haa ... How many times can I tell you I do not understand?

ID=15922012
Mu ... I heard that I lost my memory, I thought that maybe personality may have changed ...

ID=15922013
I do not know at all what I was doing here.

ID=15922014
... I do not look like a lie or acting.

ID=15922015
%username% I know is completely different ...\nEyes and talking way ... to the atmosphere.

ID=15922016
I am sorry to say a tough person, even though I was the first person to meet.\nI hope the crack does not exist in the future relationship.

ID=15922017
Hahaha! I do not need to worry. I have nothing to do with men, so I do not enter cracks!

ID=15922018
I do not care, I receive it.\nMy name is Teneburis. It is such a form now, but once used as a soul worker of justice.

ID=15922019
Tenne ... hmm ... It sounds like you heard somewhere ...

ID=15922020
There was Tenebrus who had exactly the same figure as me over there, so there is a possibility that%username% heard it.

ID=15922021
But, it is a stranger ... No, it is "Teneburis\

ID=15922022
Another one? Did you say that they broke up in two people?

ID=15922023
Does user%% know the existence of soul spirit in the human body?\nIt is a phenomenon that the will of a person separates from the body, but in many cases it is common for children to appear.

ID=15922024
Seoul Spirit ... I can understand almost anything.\nI have seen a similar person two or three times.

ID=15922025
It will be easy to understand if you have seen it.\nI became that soul spirit you know, it is a thing separated from the main body.

ID=15922026
For Seoul Spirit it seems that it grows considerably?

ID=15922027
The soul spirit can be any form depending on the desire of the main body.\nIn my case it seems that the mind that I thought "I would like to remain in the space" embodied on the day when I was kicked out of the blank.

ID=15922028
I'm not interested in how you are Soul Spirit. Is there a memory of this from such a thing?\nI do not like to talk to men, but I only care about that.

ID=15922029
Now, do you want me to wash out what happened to me obediently?

ID=15922030
......

ID=15922031
I'm sorry, I can not do that.

ID=15922032
Haa ... What is next time?\nI do not want to tell you, I was planning to do it myself.

ID=15922033
There is a reason, I can not say it.\n... Will not you understand it now?

ID=55922001
Perhaps, is it related to the name of the girl who told me when I saw my face for the first time?

ID=55922002
... I can not deny it.

ID=55922003
You certainly have lost memory.\nBut I still could not see if you really changed.

ID=55922004
If you give it to me straightforwardly, I can not completely trust%username%.

ID=55922005
Hahaha! I also hardly believe the words of a man, so they are mutual!

ID=55922006
Well, it seems I do not care.

ID=55922007
I will just watch over your work here.\nIf you judge that you are a trustworthy person ... I'll tell you all that time.

ID=55922008
Choose it yourself. I will find out what I want to know.

ID=25922001
... I suppose I will never meet again.

ID=65922001
Oh, you came to a nice place. We were about to finish the surrounding reconnaissance and we were about to organize a search group of places where we stepped on a little.

ID=65922002
What about starting the survey? Just be bored and leave it to me!

ID=65922003
It is the best scenario if found.\nEveryone who entered the blank is exceptionally powerful, so if you take them back, the war with Vesi ... I am looking forward to imagination alone.

ID=65922004
Say such a thing, I hope you find it really.

ID=65922005
In fact, it is not a very good situation to go.\nI tried communicating in all directions with Amanda 's ability, but I did not get any income.

ID=65922006
Even if I use radio waves, it does not matter if there is no recipient?\nAs I was planning to go out for playing, it would be nice to look for it directly.

ID=65922007
It is ambitious and very well.\nBut we are not satisfied with that degree. Discover different powers at once and take them all back to reality.

ID=65922008
Therefore, I would like to help% a little in%username% this time as well.\nHaha, I'm just bent about leaving.

ID=65922009
Even if it is usual, even if it is said that it is now bad now ...\nYou can put more emphasis on us and you can tell me to help others?

ID=65922010
Mr. great will order like that, but at least I do not remember such order?\nI do not like like using the kindness of the people who help with good intentions.

ID=65922011
Currently, our biggest mission is organizing the surroundings.\nSince it is a blank space unknown what will happen, we need to secure safety before other troops come in sequentially.

ID=65922012
Even if it is a flying summer insect,\nSpeaking of great people, they must do it.

ID=65922013
Even if the world is destroyed to come here while knowing that, a class society still as usual.

ID=65922014
It can not be helped even if it goes anywhere, let's keep it about this.\nThen let's get into the main subject.

ID=65922015
Is there a somewhat somewhat ominous building over there over there?\nIt seems to be a blank abnormal phenomenon, but from that, energy that is not extraordinary was perceived.

ID=65922016
As you get close it's quite huge energy. The investigation team who accompanied E.S. P makes it easy for us to break in.

ID=65922017
Okay, from here it is something that common things can not imagine?\nI was depressed by missing a near soul worker, but it has become fun!

ID=65922018
Hahaha, I beg you with that momentum.

ID=45922001
Search, cheers for good work.

ID=35922001
This ... it was quite annoying.\nNo way, the remnants of Rapid Flame of Grace City will appear to such a place.

ID=15932001
Chit, until you come to such a place I wonder what you have to do with those guys!

ID=15932002
Like whitespace in the sky of a human city, there is exactly the same blank space in the area of ​​Vesi?\nThere were no mystery or shit in those who welcomed me for the first time as soon as they came to the blank.

ID=15932003
Tenebris would know a bit about this situation. Can you ask me a moment?

ID=55932001
Tenebury? It's a name I tried to ask somewhere ...

ID=55932002
Have you forgotten it yet? The legendary soul workers ...

ID=55932003
I did not forget, I just do not want to remember!\nThere is no space to remember the name of a man in my brain!

ID=55932004
Oh, yes. Is that so.\nTenebris is on the other bank, so please go.

ID=25932001
Yes, you are welcome.

ID=65932001
I came back, thanks for your hard work.\nNo way that it will fight with Vesi.

ID=65932002
It seems that you are not used to fighting Vesi?

ID=65932003
As I mentioned earlier, we avoided useless conflicts with the Vesi.\nBecause I was busy processing soul junk boiling in the blank.

ID=65932004
First of all, it is strange that Vesi is stationed in such a place.\nBecause the area around this area is an area where supplies were exhausted and abandoned long ago ...

ID=65932005
Did not you forget something?\nOr maybe I am planning a dubious plan.

ID=65932006
Whatever the reason, it appears that it appeared as if you predicted that you would come here.

ID=65932007
It is over if the buds are picked up while they are small.\nDo not worry! I will clean the whole thing at all!

ID=65932008
... I can not feel any tension.\nAre not you thinking of battle like a single entertainment?

ID=65932009
Hmm? Well, it is such a feeling.\nWell, of course I am fighting to help people but if you do anything you should fight fun?

ID=65932010
......

ID=65932011
What's wrong, something wrong?

ID=65932012
No, I have talked to you like this once. please do not worry.

ID=65932013
Oh, by the way, do you know me when you were in the blank?\nHow was it? Did I live as it was just like that now?

ID=65932014
... Yes, I was very selfish.

ID=95932001
Well ... good ... ... Welcome back%username%.\nEven if you are moving hard and heavy things, can you appeal to that sense of justice and friendship?

ID=95932002
Have you expected such a thing to someone who does not memorize the name properly?

ID=95932003
Haha ... yes, I did not expect that.

ID=95932004
I feel like I saw it somewhere ...\nOh, Spirit Pathfinder of Grace City?

ID=95932005
Even though I can not remember the name of a man, I remember the name of a mass of iron.

ID=95932006
I bother forgetting the name of a man.

ID=95932007
Anyway, it is correct. It's that Spirit Pathfinder.\nWe will install it on the scene and use it to check the flow of soul energy.

ID=95932008
Is it to search for people by the reaction of Seoul Energy?\nIs there not enough progress to rely on this?

ID=95932009
Since I have not found anyone since I got here, I guess the top has also been overgrown.\nIt will not work properly anyway.

ID=95932010
In the opinion of Dr. Sarah, if there are so many blanks to discharge so many workers and soul workers,\nIt seems that Seoul Energy is certainly infesting everywhere.

ID=95932011
It seems that at the moment of starting up the machine, reactions come out from all directions and it can not distinguish which is which.\nEven though I know all that, I carry this heavy machine. Because it is a command of a great san ... hahaha.

ID=95932012
Hahah! Work to lower your head to others is hard work! I do not help this chore at all because I do not ...

ID=95932013
Good ... ... ... ah, already, shoulder ...! Why did I do this ...

ID=95932014
Where is the remaining Spirit Pathfinder? I will transfer everything!

ID=95932015
... What will you lower your head to others?

ID=95932016
Thankfully, I will only accept your feelings. Because%username% has an important mission of setting it on the operational site.\nLeave such a thing to us.

ID=95932017
Oh ~, Amanda sister! Gentleness that is considerate of others ... It is fluffy!

ID=95932018
Someday it will absolutely ruin. Sake, entertainment and women.

ID=95932019
So, the next job is to set this up, is not it wrong?\nWait for me as we go for a walk lightly!

ID=45932001
Hahaha, I got a lot of effort.\nI ended up losing everything after all.

ID=45932002
I did not mind so much because I was crowded a lot.\nThat's what I expected.

ID=35932001
Well, it was within the forecast that the Spirit Pathfinder could not be used\n... It is different from what I expected.

ID=35932002
What is it?

ID=15942001
Spirit Pathfinder can not sense Seoul Energy at all.\nIncluding%username% and other energy from other people, all.

ID=15942002
It is contrary to the expectation that Seoul Energy is overflowing and can not be detected.\nSo I'm investigating the cause of a simple machine failure.

ID=15942003
Is not it just a malfunction? You could not sense Seoul Energy here, did you?

ID=15942004
It's a brand new item that was newly introduced for blank search, so it can not be broken ...

ID=15942005
Oh, can you go to Amanda once more than that?\nI was looking for%username% earlier with a serious face.

ID=15942006
No way ... confession!

ID=15942007
Hahaha, it is an interesting joke.

ID=15942008
Surely, it is probably that such things as having laundered too much to dry up, or forgetting to close the main hopper of the stove.\nLooking for%username% is a washing line thick.

ID=55942001
... That is the time for jokes to pass.

ID=55942002
I was not a joke.\nJust show me your face once.

ID=25942001
Take care. I will see you off here.

ID=65942001
Ah. %username%, I came!\nI'm busy but I'm sorry for calling you one time.

ID=65942002
The overcrowding commander over there said that I was calling because the laundry was stagnant?

ID=65942003
Oh ... you can ignore me. That man was originally such a person.

ID=65942004
Indeed, it seems that you got the confidence of your subordinates perfectly.

ID=65942005
What I called is ... a strange voice was heard.

ID=65942006
There were times when "laughing" or "came" and sometimes laughing awkward laughter.\nIt seems that it sounds close to%username%, but noise like a tinnitus is also occurring together and it's quite handy to analyze the content.

ID=65942007
what is that. A ghost appearing in B class horror movies?

ID=65942008
It is a place I want to say that it is not a ghost to flowing though ...\nI do not know anything yet.

ID=65942009
Next to Vesi is a ghost ...\nIf you stay here, you will not be dying and will not die.

ID=65942010
I'd like to take a positive attitude for this positive attitude.\n... I am afraid to die.

ID=65942011
No matter what happens I will defend, so do not worry!

ID=65942012
... Once in a while, I believe.

ID=95942001
It looks a lot like fun.\nWas there something good too?

ID=95942002
Haha, I must have seen the man 's face right now, but my mood was perfect.

ID=95942003
I am sorry for taking your time.\nThere is something to be worried about by all means, may I ask you only one?

ID=95942004
Oh, why not.\nBut, as long as I can not go out with you, please summarize to the utmost.

ID=95942005
It is a simple interest.\nIt is that ring that%username% wears.

ID=95942006
Oh! It's fun to be worried about this!

ID=95942007
How? If made of wire it is pretty good, is not it?\nAs it will rust as it is, I was planning to machine it someday ...

ID=95942008
Did you mean ... did you make it yourself?

ID=95942009
No, it is a gift.

ID=95942010
Gift ... Who would you ask if I got it from?

ID=95942011
I do not know why I'm interested so far, but I do not mind being interested in men ...\nWell, I will answer the question though.

ID=95942012
In Kandas city, Katherine was made by the child.\nIt was a girl who chased me even though I liked it ... in an accident, it became a relic.

ID=95942013
So ... are you always treating it?

ID=95942014
Oh, I just want to wear this inevitable.\nIt is also a proof of determination to save the world ...

ID=95942015
......

ID=95942016
Oh, I was here. I looked for%username%.

ID=95942017
Wow ... more men ...

ID=95942018
I did not want to come.\nHow was the story with Amanda? As I said it was not a permanent business?

ID=95942019
Something, I heard you hear a ghost voice.

ID=95942020
Also abnormal phenomenon ... Is there still a limit to what we can understand with our knowledge?\nOh, I wish I could really be saved if Tenneburi of the legend who lives somewhere knows something ....

ID=95942021
... The commander.\nI understand your feelings, but there are reasons why I do not speak to the blank ...

ID=95942022
Chit ... Also it ...\nRecently it seems to be popular to embrace the secret as much as possible.

ID=95942023
Well, that is postponement. %username%, It seems that we have located the headquarters of the people this time.

ID=95942024
Because the machine is useless, the E.S.P unit directly inspected it and identified the places where they gathered well.\nThere seems to be a machine that collects energy, Flame Tempest.

ID=95942025
Collect energy ... Can you do such a thing with Vesi who is outside?

ID=95942026
No, this is a machine made by a human who cooperated with Vesi.\nRapid Flame was positively using at Grace City.

ID=95942027
Tempest ...? Oh, the monster of a machine that has ruined people and is eating ...\nWhy is it in the blank?

ID=95942028
I am only reading roughly in the report, but I can not believe it would inject a soul energy into a human being and rupture it.

ID=95942029
Perhaps, when Vesi was sucked in, she probably came in with me.\n... Maybe there is the possibility that all the people left here are also sacrificed.

ID=95942030
Why do not you just go and break all things? Leave it to me!

ID=95942031
After all,%username% is always radical.

ID=95942032
......

ID=95942033
What happened ... Tenebris.\nDo such a serious look.

ID=95942034
No ... nothing.\nNow, just a little ... I seem to have seen%username% I know ...

ID=45942001
It did really well!\nBecause of the active user%%username%, since the surrounding Rapid Flame retired, Fortune troops could enter.

ID=45942002
Thanks to you, you said that you injured and cowards trying to escape from the blank\nIt has become possible to stop it.\nFloof ... ...%username% everyone.

ID=35942001
... Perhaps you are an evil human being, are not you?

ID=35942002
It is not me who is bad. Society is bad.

ID=15952001
It seems that Miriam is coming at the dispatch of Fortune troops.\nIt seemed to be busy in assembling a medical tent, how about going to see him?

ID=55952001
Oh, Miriam oden! Does it finally come! I have to help with assembling the tent with all my might!

ID=55952002
Free from working clothes, now is a rest period?\nWhy are you bothering going to work?

ID=55952003
Helping girls is not labor but life.\nAlright to remember! You do not have eyeglasses!

ID=55952004
Well, if you say that you want to do so, stop shopping.\nI will be waiting so please go quickly.

ID=25952001
Oh, were not you going?

ID=65952001
Oh,%username%!\nI am sorry, was it a bit late, is not it? It takes more time to prepare than I thought ...

ID=65952002
I can wait for Miriam Omie for five years, even ten years, but when will you come in my arms?

ID=65952003
Haha ... you have not given up yet.\nIt's fine and healthy, but what's more.

ID=65952004
Would you please tell me about the situation here?\nI have been preparing at Loco Town for a long time and I do not understand anything.

ID=65952005
I guess there was nothing special about this. Rapid Flame appeared, was it a little expelled?

ID=65952006
Vece who was in Grace City ... It is came to such a place ...

ID=65952007
About people sucked in? I heard that one person has not been helped yet though ...

ID=65952008
Exactly. No matter where you go, all this non-existent area is spreading.

ID=65952009
... I see.

ID=65952010
Ah, but there was only one person. Te ... ... tennis racket?

ID=65952011
tennis racket ...?

ID=65952012
Wait a moment ... Maybe ... Te ... Tenebris! What?

ID=65952013
Ah! so! Such a name!\nHmm ...? By the way, my boyfriend in front of Miriam ...

ID=65952014
Well ... that's not it ... that's not it!

ID=65952015
... As long as you see that easy-to-understand reaction, is it around?

ID=65952016
Surely, how about then? What did you talk with that person?

ID=65952017
Oh ~, I have not talked barely.\nTypical "I have a serious secret, but you can not say anything to avoid making the incident unnecessarily complicated" type.

ID=65952018
Well, yeah ... did you feel good? Memory? Someone ... Did not you mention things like those who remember?

ID=65952019
I told you earlier ... but it is easy to understand.

ID=65952020
Haha, what are you talking about?

ID=65952021
Oh, sorry%username%! I still told you a bit about talking about camping assembly still being left!\nThe talk is here! Will you come back later?

ID=65952022
see you soon! See you next time!

ID=65952023
Well, I'm not going to tell you anything, so I'll give you a break today.\nBe sure to come and listen to me so prepare your heart!

ID=65952024
Well, yeah ... I understand ... later ... Well ... someday ...

ID=95952001
Thank you for your hard work,%username%.\nThis time I completely cleaned up.

ID=95952002
If so, do you have something else to say?

ID=95952003
I agree., I am sorry.\nBefore that, there is always something I want to ask.

ID=95952004
Chit ... I do not want to talk long, so let me finish it easily.

ID=95952005
Well then, I will ask you straight away.\nMr.%username%, what are you fighting against the enemy for? What is life going on?

ID=95952006
Is not that decided? Save the weak and fight strong man! Forecasting hero's life even nothing tomorrow what happens today!\nI am now the hero.

ID=95952007
Well ... if you do, after all you are.

ID=95952008
... is the biggest reason I was thinking until this time!\nNow, other reasons are the best.

ID=95952009
Is that so?

ID=95952010
Did you hear about this ring before?\nSomewhat ago I tried various things with all kinds of power to save the girl who gave me this ring.\nBut I could not save it after all.

ID=95952011
So then I swore to that girl I was and now.\nI always put it on my fingers to remember that oath.

ID=95952012
Oath, is it?

ID=95952013
Absolutely to save the world.

ID=95952014
......

ID=95952015
At that time it might not have been serious so far. But gradually my presence in myself and that oath grew bigger.

ID=95952016
But that woman is already in this world ...

ID=95952017
Oh, that's right. Even if we save the world, she can not save it any more.

ID=95952018
Still, what I liked or wanted to protect ... that kind of thing is still in the world.

ID=95952019
Everyone is loved by a child like a bright sun.

ID=95952020
So ... even if herself is dead.\nTo everyone's memory and heart, she is still alive.

ID=95952021
......

ID=95952022
Hahaha! It's strange, right? This girl is being swayed by a younger girl why?

ID=95952023
... Efforts to do so will be done no matter how difficult it is to keep this oath.

ID=95952024
... I understand that.\nI'm serious about%username%, are not you?

ID=95952025
With regards to lady, you never thought you were serious?

ID=95952026
Hehe, it is your reply.

ID=95952027
I'm really sorry I let you take your time.\nBut with this I can also relax a bit ...

ID=95952028
I am not interested in what you think.\nWell then.

ID=45952001
It seems that he was talking with the legendary soul worker,\nDid something happen?

ID=35952001
I did not have anything, I do not think so.

ID=35952002
Really. If it is, there is something I want you to help a little ...

ID=35952003
Well, I'm just bored,\nTry tell me why.

ID=15962001
If you are willing to cooperate, let's talk about work.\nRapid Flame was completely exterminated, but also a place that might be an acquaintance appeared.

ID=15962002
E.S.P unit has already abandoned the search because it is dangerous because you do not know what will come out.\nIf%username% is OK ...

ID=15962003
No, to be frank with you. I can not investigate unless it is%username%.\nPlease ask for my best regards.

ID=55962001
You do not know what will come out? Can you easily tell me why I do not understand?

ID=55962002
It's hard to explain a bit, but as the word says "a place that might be acquitted".

ID=55962003
It was only strange that I was visiting a phantom or suddenly moved to a strange place.\nIf%username% wants to enjoy the thrill, we recommend you go once.

ID=55962004
It's quite bad. Alright, I'll be back right now!

ID=25962001
Survey, thank you.

ID=45962001
Hahaha! It was seriously a brawl field! Are they a ghost or something?

ID=45962002
I am also confused.\nThe enemy that appeared at that time was a figure that%username% looked like the enemy he fought before ... is that so?

ID=35962001
Yes Yes. Although saying it was like a vision though it was said.

ID=35962002
Well ... I did not understand anything after all.\nHowever, Tenebrus who was living here may know something. Why do not you ask?

ID=15972001
Can you talk with a guy again? I do not want to talk with a man for more than 5 minutes a day ...

ID=15972002
There is no one else to depend on, I will ask.\nI will follow you as long as you do not want to go so.

ID=55972001
If you have time to go with you, you can go by yourself.

ID=55972002
Is not it because there is no story of a person who actually played an active part in the field?\nJust keep silent.

ID=55972003
Education

ID=25972001
What are you doing, I will go early.

ID=65972001
Oh, I came again.

ID=65972002
I do not feel well. Was battle difficult?

ID=65972003
No, it's hard to see your face.

ID=65972004
Hahaha.\nIt is a really honest person.

ID=65972005
I do not have a day but I only see the face of a man, but I understand the feeling.

ID=65972006
So? Were not you going to ask something?

ID=65972007
That's right, Tenebris.\nIs there anything you can know about what%username% is experiencing?

ID=65972008
I can only answer that there is no information that can identify something.

ID=65972009
This is a place full of blanks, phenomena which can not be explained by common sense.\nBecause it is filled with Desire Energy, no matter what happens, there is nothing to be surprised about.

ID=65972010
Desire Energy ... ?! Are those words serious?

ID=65972011
Oh, did not you know?

ID=65972012
I do not know or nothing, how can I investigate the inaccessible blanks.

ID=65972013
I see ... I will have to explain from the nature of the blank.

ID=65972014
The blank is not a natural disaster nor a special space, it is a mass of enormous designer energy.\nOne big energy with the desire to "breathe everything".

ID=65972015
Therefore, in this area where we stand, Desire Energy is more familiar than air.

ID=65972016
I see ... was there reason why the Spirit Pathfinder that senses soul energy did not work?

ID=65972017
The reaction of Seoul Energy was drowned out by overwhelming Desire Energy and I could not sense anything.\nIt would have been noticed if Dr. Sarah was there, but anyway it is not when you need to say a human.

ID=65972018
No, wait ...?\nAmanda 's communication capability will be using Seoul Energy, so why can you use it?

ID=65972019
Soul Energy and Desire Energy should have had the property of extinguishing when they hit each other?

ID=65972020
......

ID=65972021
Well, if you say that,%username% can not use the power of soul worker,\nI should have said that it was good.

ID=65972022
For the time being, I will ask the person of the discrimination group investigating this energy to dispatch in the blank as promptly as possible.\n%username% is resting during that time.

ID=65972023
Er, are you off again? I do not feel like talking ...

ID=65972024
It is dangerous to move unnecessarily, as I understood that this is the base of Desire Energy.\nYou have to know in advance what the influence is at a minimum.

ID=65972025
Now, as work gets full - blown, I do not have time to rest, so let 's take a rest now.\nThis is a command as a commander.

ID=65972026
It can not be helped if it is told so far. I wonder if I will visit Miriam Oh!

ID=95972001
Miriam Oden! I came to visit ~!

ID=95972002
Oh, well ...

ID=95972003
... What 's the matter, suddenly, so depressed ... what happened?

ID=95972004
Oh ... a little Well ... There is a personal concern ...

ID=95972005
I do not know what to worry about, but please tell me comfortably.\nI will get on counsel as much!

ID=95972006
That ... that is not so serious! Just ... well ...

ID=95972007
I was talking with Tenebris earlier, did not he?\nDid not you talk something about Tenebris, me?

ID=95972008
Oh ... it was such a trouble ...

ID=95972009
It seems she did not feel like listening suddenly ...

ID=95972010
It is not a level to get out of my mind if you talk to a girl in front of a man you like ...

ID=95972011
I mean ... I do not! Haha! Somehow it has become ashamed.

ID=95972012
Even if I see it all I know is that, I will keep that kind of thing.\nSo what is worry?

ID=95972013
......

ID=95972014
Well, that's not my story, but my friends! There was a man who used to be friends ...\nBut that person may have lost his memory and may not remember anything ...

ID=95972015
It looks like a novel, but the real story ... ha ...

ID=95972016
Haha ... I do not want to be still talking about white ...

ID=95972017
That friend likes that person ... so, I want to help you.

ID=95972018
When that friend met with a guy ... I wonder if I should say a voice ...?

ID=95972019
The man seems to be unaware of his friends ... I am not in the blank ... friends in the hospital! There is no compensation that I have met the man.

ID=95972020
When you call out more than anything, you may be hurt if anyone eyes you ...\nTrue, I wonder what I should do ... I'm troubled ...

ID=95972021
Miriam, you are less disturbing than you thought?

ID=95972022
That ... ... So! How many times it is not my story ...

ID=95972023
Listen carefully because it is good.\nThere is no need to worry. Go straight and bump. Speak as usual without suffering what to say.

ID=95972024
Are you OK? If it became a burden or not me ... If I had not remembered that person ... what should I do?

ID=95972025
If you do not pretend not to watch your whole life, you have to say words at all?\nIt is for the opponent to express words to the utmost maximum.

ID=95972026
No, just forget that guy in my arms! That's for each other!

ID=95972027
Ahaha ... I will remember all but the last word ...

ID=95972028
Do not be afraid, I will hit it once ... Yeah.

ID=95972029
here we go! The trouble has also disappeared and if there is time ...

ID=95972030
Oh, that's right, just a call came! It seems that Martin is calling.

ID=95972031
I do not want to go much ...

ID=95972032
Huh ... It might be a very urgent situation! I guess it is better to go to bed earlier?

ID=95972033
Okay, I understand. I will go.\n... Be sure to tell the time to see the time. all right?

ID=95972034
Yeah ... Do not just keep away from it ...

ID=45972001
Is your vacation already OK?

ID=45972002
Miriam, hey, heard that there is tremendous urgency ...

ID=45972003
I do not have any bad taste like calling me immediately after issuing a vacation order.\nI dislike most as one of the victims. That's it.

ID=45972004
When you have to take a day off, take a good rest.\nIf I have power, I intend to fight against the power of the darkness for the security of the rest of the soldiers.

ID=45972005
Then, have you been shaken ...\nAfter all it is useless if you are interested in a girl with a boyfriend.

ID=45972006
You ought to have never tried various girls from now on.

ID=45972007
Anyway, there is no work at rest%username%. Somewhere different ....

ID=45972008
Disagreeable! Neither Miriam Ojee nor me,\nDo not you think it would be better to go outside and play than doing here?

ID=45972009
Well ... I see ...? I really appreciate it if you will help me ...\nIs it really okay?

ID=45972010
There must be a lot of things that can not be done otherwise, are not we? Try everything!

ID=45972011
Hmm ... If so, I'm sorry but I beg you to thank you ...

ID=45972012
The other day, another unexpected%username% did a survey and a similar illusion appeared.

ID=45972013
The phantom itself was cleared up by the E.S.P unit ... something a little troubled happened

ID=45972014
Oh, is that a terrible strong enemy?

ID=35972001
A clown clown, Edgar appeared.

ID=35972002
Edgar? Really?

ID=15982001
Although it is an illusion,%username% who is engaged in battle as being a Vesi belonging to a danger class is the most suitable.\nOriginally I was planning to let our E.S.P unit process it, but it is a fact that it is a burden.

ID=15982002
I thought that was probably because the people who saw it jumped out one after another.

ID=15982003
It looks a little uneasy.\nCan you fight?

ID=55982001
It was rather good! It is good just to let Miriam Omie shed a furious anger!

ID=55982002
I am sorry to rely on it after all, but do not try too hard.

ID=25982001
Have not you gone yet? Hahaha, you can take a day off if you want to have a break.

ID=45982001
Good job. You returned well.

ID=45982002
It's not as hard as it is!\nI let you eat bullets a little bit on his creepy face, I feel a little lighter!

ID=45982003
By the way it seems I was talking to someone during the investigation ...\nDid something happen?

ID=45982004
Oh, that?\nI heard somewhat like visual illusion. Is not it a common thing here?

ID=45982005
It's not ...\nNo, it's impossible ...

ID=45982006
Oh, did you come by Tenebris?\nIf you have something to know, please tell me everything.

ID=45982007
Because it may be my misunderstanding.\n... It is true that I want you to be a misunderstanding.

ID=45982008
I have to tell any misunderstanding.\nWill you tell me so that our investigation will be furious?

ID=45982009
I am sorry, but I can not say that.

ID=45982010
A bit Tene, we met someone who was not flexible like you before we came here.\nHe told me not to say anything until after the incident eventually told me to tell me.

ID=45982011
We learned then. It is said that you should keep listening persistently even if you say that you do not want to say it.\nIf you do not say it now, you will witness the persistence of our research team?

ID=45982012
I am also suffering from a feeling of wanting to say ...

ID=45982013
So why?

ID=45982014
... Here I say,%username% is dangerous.

ID=45982015
...%username% is?

ID=45982016
I have had many danger of life before now, please do not be shy about saying it!

ID=45982017
Do you declare that you are all right without knowing anything?

ID=45982018
Why do not you say that? There is nothing dangerous than fighting without knowing anything, right?

ID=45982019
Certainly, although there is also it in principle ...

ID=45982020
The truth I know is different in dimension than what you have ever experienced.\nYou can not trust even if you are told simply that you are confident.

ID=45982021
I will not try and answer again.\nWell then, what on earth do you say to me?

ID=45982022
... I have one single request to tell you.

ID=35982001
Leave here. And here we are not somewhere to fight for people.

ID=15992001
I can not tell you anything, but abandon someone who needs help and run away?\nHey, is not it too awful?

ID=15992002
Yes! It is too cruel! Even if it is said that we should leave in one direction, we are in trouble!

ID=15992003
In the first place, if%username% leaves here, it will interfere with the investigation of the blank.\nPerhaps you give up the investigation and you may have to return the baggage together!

ID=15992004
Is the Star Forest Union a group that can not do anything because there is no soul worker alone?\nEven if%username% alone is gone ...

ID=15992005
It's not a simple dependency problem! Those who do not understand do not speak!

ID=15992006
Declining morale of the survey team is also a problem.\nBecause of the concern that you may be terrible at times, the number of people who will leave will be going on.

ID=15992007
In the first place, there are many people who participate in the survey just because there are soul workers.\nIf%username% is gone, the investigation team will lose its root.

ID=15992008
Of course%username% Although the collective dependence is concentrated on one person.\nWe have to understand that the investigation can proceed because there is the%username%.

ID=15992009
If so, please leave everyone.\nIt is dangerous to stop%username% in this abnormal space.

ID=15992010
I can not do that! You may have clues to save the world here.

ID=15992011
... Of course it is important to know that if you return home by hand, you will get painful eyes from great people,\nThat's a personal matter ...

ID=15992012
It is a blank space that can finally be investigated by finding things.\nIt's been 15 years since the blanks were opened, and there is no precedent as one.

ID=15992013
I can not give up the opportunity I might grasp the clues to save the people suffering from the blanks.\nAnything is okay, I will not go back until I get results here.

ID=15992014
Oh, my old man always took care of herself, but what have you done today?

ID=15992015
I have no will to motivate myself not to want to.\nThere was no reason I came up to the commander at this age.

ID=15992016
Besides, there is no one to come here to take the command except me.\nThe wonderful one will stand out on his own regret. So, I have to do it.

ID=15992017
It is more stubborn than I thought ...\nLet's ask%username%, Are you sure that you can bear with whatever happens?

ID=15992018
How many times should I say without worrying about it?

ID=15992019
If you stay here like this, you will certainly have a day to regret.\nThat's why I'm listening.

ID=15992020
You certainly are strong.\nBut before then it was an ordinary human being, is not he a student?

ID=15992021
It is a time when emotions appear most clearly and clearly, and it is also a time when emotions can not be controlled at the same time.\nEven if you recognize yourself as strong, there are things that will be broken by something that is nothing.

ID=15992022
Well then, are you sure to see it now? I wonder if myself is brute or real!

ID=15992023
......

ID=15992024
This is not an easy pride.\nBefore that, I never obediently follow the words of a man.

ID=15992025
No. I think that I just do not understand how serious the current situation is.\n%username% is also stubborn than it looks.

ID=15992026
I am sorry, but I will tell you the place from now on so that no one will be asked.\nPlease follow me where I was.

ID=55992001
Now what are you going to do intimidating with just two people?

ID=55992002
Do not worry. With this body that is only a soul, you can not harm you.

ID=55992003
I'm sorry, can the commander wait in another place?

ID=55992004
If it's an important story, I think it is necessary for me to be a commander as well.

ID=55992005
It is a personal story.\nIf you want to know the contents, please listen to me personally later.

ID=55992006
However, I do not know if%username% will talk.

ID=55992007
Well ... I am worried about what you are talking about ...\nThere is no help if it is a personal story. understood.

ID=25992001
... Please tell me later what you talked about.

ID=65992001
I have been waiting for you.\nActually ... I am still wondering what I should do about this story.

ID=65992002
There are a lot of troubles.\nTry it. Because there should not be any problem separately.

ID=65992003
I do not even know what I'm talking about from now on to say I'm OK ...\nSuch unfounded confidence is not courage but just arrogance.

ID=65992004
Just say something like that from a while ago ...\nTired of just warnings?

ID=65992005
... I can see that being augmented is visible\nI do not seem to go back any more, so I will tell you.

ID=65992006
There is one thing I want to confirm just before entering the main subject.\nI told you heard a voice of unknown identity in the previous strategy, can you tell me more about that voice?

ID=65992007
It looked like my voice, but I was not talking.\nWhat a way I feel like someone else?

ID=65992008
It resembles the voice of%username% ... Is it no doubt?

ID=65992009
There is no mistake, because there are not many such good voices.

ID=65992010
... Then you do not have to hesitate to tell this content.

ID=65992011
I will ask you only one thing first.\n%username% is Halle Estiah, Lily Blum fairy tale, Stella Universel.\nAre you familiar with these three people, especially Halle Estia?

ID=65992012
I've heard of Lily, but I have never actually met him.\nIt is a woman's name because it is in memory.

ID=65992013
It's complicated whether you do not know, but it is complicated. I understood it for the time being.

ID=65992014
Now the people I mentioned are the desire workers who killed a lot of people in the blank.

ID=65992015
Desire worker ... Is it a designer version of Soul worker?

ID=65992016
Yes. There is a difference in the name of energy to use and the driving force of power, but you can think that it is almost unchanged.

ID=65992017
But like Vesi they were just loyal to their "desires".\nSimply hate human beings and enjoy violence ... Also, it was simply the reason that it is fun to die people.

ID=65992018
They already missed the ordinary as a human being.\nI deny everything except myself ... It was exactly how I realized desire.

ID=65992019
I fought with them many times in the blank.\nWake up as a "true" soul worker ... to protect people and "justice".

ID=65992020
As you can see now, thanks to that, I was able to become "a soul worker of justice".

ID=65992021
So?\nI am now the same as you, you became one of the heroes to save the world?

ID=65992022
Of course I thought that it was just a fun game until this time,\n... After I swear to that girl I intend to be a little serious.

ID=65992023
I do not have such an idea whether to play a hero of justice.\nI can never give up on my mind, at least trying to make this world even decent.

ID=65992024
Well ... That's right.\nIf so, now that mind is your truth.

ID=65992025
Well ... I will tell you a little more.

ID=65992026
......

ID=65992027
In the group "I joined the Dark Moon Nocturne" which I created by collecting survivors in the blank ...\nOne traitor was included.

ID=65992028
Well, I think that I was not interested in surviving in cooperation with people from the beginning.\nWhether or not the person's behavioral standards are interested only for me ...

ID=65992029
... So?

ID=65992030
Still, I was acting with familiar face-up, so I did not notice it at all.\nHe could not win boredom, he felt something to the designer workers.

ID=65992031
He left a word unknown to regain his true figure and became a designer worker and killed people without survival.\nWith a smile that looks like a fun you have never showed when you were with me.

ID=65992032
Like a child who found a favorite toy, that face that was killing people while holding a happy smile.\n... I will certainly remember seeing you.

ID=65992033
I noticed from the middle what kind of story I would like to talk about.\nWith my personality, the possibility of doing that is enough.

ID=65992034
At that time ... In other words, I know that%username% was depressed only by fully enjoying his "pleasure".\nTherefore, it became a good food of the Desire Energy that is prevailing in this world.

ID=65992035
I was worried that you would recall myself when you were a killer someday and regain the emotions of those days.\nSo, I could not talk to you until now.

ID=65992036
At least I do not want to see the face of%username% never returning to the whole body and rejoicing while receiving blood.

ID=65992037
Hahaha, that's right ... I see ...

ID=65992038
I think that the only thing remaining in%username% who escaped from the blank and lost memory of 15 years was only the desire to lose purpose.

ID=65992039
And the first thing you jumped into your eyes is "human crisis".\nDesire of Desire who lost its purpose was replaced with the desire of "to save humanity".

ID=65992040
Otherwise, just because a high school student,%username%, can not compete with life just because there is a different ability.\nHuman heart is not pure and strong so far.

ID=65992041
If you tell this fact, I knew that%username% would be shocked.\nSo, I did not want to talk as much as possible.

ID=65992042
But if%username% will stay here, someday your shadow ... past%username% will swallow you.\nSince it is necessary to avoid only that, so we talked to him ...

ID=65992043
You are different from you in the past. You can still escape from here enough.\nSo please, please leave from here.

ID=65992044
escape ...?

ID=65992045
If you are a different person from the old%username% and there is a heart to try to help people ...\nPlease leave from here before Desire Energy gets runaway.

ID=65992046
Sorry, but would you give me some time to think?\nI do not think that answers will come out soon.

ID=65992047
Yes, you will not be able to decide immediately ...\nI am waiting for you here.

ID=95992001
Ha ha ha! Did you ask all the stories?

ID=95992002
Tenebris was trying to hide it, but let's hear from himself.\nNow,%username%! Share important information for the future of humanity!

ID=95992003
......

ID=95992004
Um ...%username%?

ID=95992005
Not much ... It was not a big deal.

ID=95992006
Is it so ...? Even though you just cleared it?

ID=95992007
Do not mind anymore! Because I should understand!

ID=95992008
Yeah, what is it ... Is that the degree of friendship between the two people?

ID=95992009
I am not connected with a man by friendship or something!

ID=95992010
And this is my problem,\nSo now you believe me?

ID=95992011
... understood. I believe.

ID=95992012
It seems that it is not content that you can speak lightly from the expression.\nIf you do not want to talk, I will give up listening too.

ID=95992013
We are a smart research team that actually conducts surveys, tracks and finds information,\nIt is not a detective who interrogates people and makes information.

ID=95992014
so? You can communicate better than I thought.

ID=95992015
I do not know what I talked about, but I am very tired.\nFor a while leave the survey to us and rest a little%username%.

ID=95992016
Oh, I understand ... Can I ask you only one thing before I take a rest?

ID=95992017
Looking from you, what kind of person am I? What do you think about soul workers?

ID=95992018
Well! What? %username% to ask me a personal question ...

ID=95992019
I want to ask because anyone can do it! Response!

ID=95992021
At one time I used the soul worker like a tool, but that was an old story.

ID=95992022
Wow ... is it meant to be a tool as well as a different person?

ID=95992023
Well, from the point of view of the great men, I and the general soldiers are treated the same,\nAt least I think that I should never forgive people like "old-handed" like old days.

ID=95992024
Even though I use this much, words are just fine.

ID=95992025
I think that the current commanders have a fixed idea since they saw the disinterested people used at the time of the past war.\nIt is strong and it is a dangerous existence which is not too tired even if fighting, so you should use it.

ID=95992026
Think about it, would not it be hard if existence that has strength far apart from humans also causes a revolt?\nSo it seems that in the past Star Forest it was trying to control from the mental side.

ID=95992027
But I ... I will change that stereotype from my generation.\nTherefore, while grinding sesame to the great people, they are hitting ...

ID=95992028
I am going to use it as a tool against the different persons and soul workers who have been used as tools in the past\nI also think that it is an apology.

ID=95992029
Really ...\nI understood, I will go with this.

ID=95992030
my mother. Yes, let's meet again.

ID=45992001
Hello,%username% ... My facial expressions are dark.

ID=45992002
Is that so? I should be perfect at any time.

ID=45992003
I thought that it was bad for you ... Actually, I was listening to the story secretly.

ID=45992004
... Huh? Oh, then you can see it is is not as usual.

ID=45992005
Haha ... the feeling that everything I know is denied ...\nIt was shocking beyond my expectation.

ID=45992006
You do not have to worry too much.\nI do not have such a feeling that I want to kill people, and I guess there are things that are all lie before that?

ID=45992007
I want to think that it is a lie ...

ID=45992008
Well ... it's bad for%username%\nI do not think Tenebras' words are lies. .

ID=45992009
why ...?

ID=45992010
I was caught up by helping someone and helping with it all the time.\nIt is terrifying for someone to hurt while working from morning till night, sometimes he does not care about myself and is unfaithful.

ID=45992011
Every time there was such a thing, I was not able to answer clearly when asked, "Why will you help people while risking?"\nI merely vaguely thought that it was my job to cure people.

ID=45992012
But it seems that it is convincing that the obsession with helping people was actually moved by other power.\n... Rather, I think so.

ID=35992001
Are not you Miriam 's hesitation regrettable?\nThe fact that I have worked hard until now is actually only being driven by something power, is not it?

ID=35992002
......

ID=16002001
Hey,%username%. There is no crazy question, but can you tell me what your future dream is?

ID=16002002
Goal? That is decided like that.

ID=16002003
Whether any woman will be the coolest man in the world that can be dropped,\nI guess looking for pleasure not to get bored every day.

ID=16002004
... There are also people who want to fulfill their oath to a girl recently.

ID=16002005
Did you forget that goal?\nIs not it right?

ID=16002006
Oh, yeah ... the first two are the goals we had in the past,\n... I also declared the oath to that child.

ID=16002007
That's right. You picked it ... are you trying to do?

ID=16002008
Of course I was not originally a doctor and I was not sure how to treat a person.\nBut, despite being a different person, I have the desire to save men, fighting in Fortune troops like this.

ID=16002009
Even if you say that this has happened due to something else, you will not regret it.\nIs not I myself in the end even my appearance working like this now?

ID=16002010
Oh, I see.

ID=16002011
How about you? You decided what you want right now.\nWhatever your heart is, your goal will not change.

ID=16002012
Oh, it will not change! That's it! After all it was useless troubles!

ID=16002013
Of course it is true that our power has a creepy root.\nEven so, the root of people will never change

ID=16002014
... Thank you, you seem to be able to organize what you should do!

ID=16002015
Finally I got back to a brazier%username% I know!\nAs usual you are swayed by women with unfounded self-confidence! all right?

ID=56002001
... It is awful even though there are only Miriam Omen who was declared a decent yet.

ID=56002002
Besides, I still deal with myself as a child, but I also have a lady to say that I like me even though I look like this.\nHow? Do not you look a little different?

ID=56002003
Well, you sure changed.\nI do not know what happened after I left Rocotown, but I can not deny it if I told you to be quiet.

ID=56002004
So you can do it well.\nWhatever you say, do not get caught up and do your best, do not you?

ID=56002005
That's it! I'm not a man who is bothered by the words of others!\nThank you very much! I go to say so to him!

ID=56002006
Yup! Welcome!

ID=56002007
... Tenebris, or ...

ID=26002001
Huhu, did you solve your problem?

ID=66002001
Hey! Tennis court!

ID=66002002
... There is only one letter, and not even a person's name, even an object.

ID=66002003
Apparently, as far as looking at all the expressions, I seem to have brought back the worst reply.

ID=66002004
worst? The worst you are thinking about you, I have nothing to do with it at all!

ID=66002005
Giving up fighting here for%username% and withdrawing is a reply for the world.\nThat is why I finally decided to tell you everything.

ID=66002006
I also as a soul worker who fought for justice at a glass cover camp.\n... I only wish that%username% of the era that I know will not wake up.

ID=66002007
Oh, do not let me say it twice.\nI do not care about you at all! all right?

ID=66002008
... I have persuaded as much as I can, so I will not have any means to stop you.\nYou seem to have no choice but to watch how you progress from now on.

ID=66002009
Haha, will you still remain! Thank you,%username%!\nI did not get sneaky by words of ghosts!

ID=66002010
It is not a ghost, please refrain from words.

ID=66002011
But bad news to%username% who made a new determination here.

ID=66002012
It seems that Junk Knight who made Kandusity disturbance was found at a time.

ID=66002013
Junk ... Oh, that black one who fought in the Canddus underground channel.

ID=66002014
It is Seoul Junk based on soul workers.\nThere is a high possibility that it appears as an illusion like before, but it is hard to say that it is weaker than the real one considering the precedent.

ID=66002015
There are only about%username%, the same soul worker, as a countermeasure.\nI just asked something difficult to complain.

ID=66002016
The trouble has also been resolved, and if the enemy appears, there is no choice but to fight.\nPut out just as I pick it up so let me know!

ID=66002017
You do not even feel tired.\n... Was there something that got the power like?

ID=66002018
There is nothing in particular.\nHowever, there is only a blank answer left as to whether his conclusion is truly correct.

ID=46002001
......

ID=46002002
If it is a mission report, should not I go to Martin instead of me?

ID=46002003
I heard a strange voice when fighting.\nIt was a voice like going directly to the brain, but it feels somewhat disgusting ...

ID=46002004
Are you planning to say it is horrible now?\n... Of course, that's a wise decision.

ID=46002005
In the previous strategy%username% heard a very clear auditory listening ... is not it?\nThat is a proof that you are little bit eroded by Desire Energy.

ID=46002006
If you noticed how many people will be sacrificed by an unnecessary battle ... even now ...

ID=46002007
Tell me how to crush that!

ID=46002008
......

ID=46002009
... Do you think that you can solve anything by fighting and winning?

ID=46002010
I got a fight from the other side!\nI am not a human being able to relax the guy who came up first!

ID=46002011
I'll erase the guy that interferes with what I try!\nIt does not matter what the ghost is supposed to be!

ID=46002012
Calm down,%username%.\n... Do you know what you are talking about now?

ID=46002013
Of course I know. I feel calm enough to restless ...

ID=46002014
No, I am not calm at all.\nI'm sure you have lost reason because of the voice you heard.

ID=46002015
The blank stimulates the trauma and fear of the targeted human being, and guides the target to want "power".\nNow that you lost reason, you do not want to beat the enemy.

ID=46002017
Well then, whatever you are doing!

ID=46002018
Oh, I was here.%username%! It's a request for a fairly dangerous work from the search group.

ID=46002019
What! Do whatever you want so please say it soon!

ID=46002020
Eh ... why are you so angry?\nMaybe it's a bit dangerous, so please calm down and ask me.

ID=46002021
... Oh, sorry.\nSo what?

ID=46002022
There was sighting information of Codename Amaryllis, a research result of the Ned Company that made a noise of Candas City temporarily.\nDoes%username% know this name?

ID=46002023
... Amaryllis ...!

ID=46002024
... It is rough. Looking at that figure, it seems that the blanks have prepared a fairly powerful toy this time.

ID=46002025
I was troubled ...\nAccording to the report,%username% is Catherine, host of Amaryllis ...

ID=46002026
Please do not tell me any further.

ID=46002027
Excuse me.\nI told extra things.

ID=46002028
But it certainly became it.\n%username%. You must never fight here any more.

ID=46002029
Your desire for anger is now uncontrollable as far as I can see.\nIt will absolutely take advantage of your trauma and weaknesses and erode Desire.

ID=46002030
If that happens, it will be a matter of time before your figure of "old days" going crazy with Desire Energy will appear.

ID=46002031
Desire ...? What is that story Tenebus.\n%username% can not have Desire Energy.

ID=46002032
Is%username% originally a soul worker?\nSince Seoul Energy and Desire Energy can not coexist, no matter how much erosion is done ...

ID=46002033
Oh yeah ... others believed that you were a soul worker.

ID=46002034
Hmm ...? What on earth is that?

ID=36002001
please do not worry.\nThis is something that%username% needs to say directly, not me.

ID=36002002
... Chit.

ID=16122001
Well then, I will ask.

ID=16122002
%username%.\nCan you now believe that you can fight without losing yourself to Amaryllis and to the end?

ID=16122003
This is not a question of whether you are physically strong or not strong.\nBecause you will be totally shadowed if the spirit collapses even a little.

ID=16122004
Now, please tell me.

ID=16122005
Do not worry ... I am fine ...

ID=16122006
As a person who fought with%username% for a while.\nWhen you say seriously, it is when you can not afford your heart all the time.

ID=16122007
... Yes, if you say that you are fine, it certainly would be a lie.\nIt is a fact that we could not afford it.

ID=16122008
But I do not want the illusion of that child's ugly figure even in illusion. I was scared or lost reason.\nYou really do not have to worry.

ID=16122009
%username% saw these serious figures so far, including the time when I worked with blanks.\n... You will be upset to the point you have never seen before.

ID=16122010
If so, even if you proceed from here, you are caught by Desire Energy 's "desire" and are only eroded.\nYou will use that voice to enter your mind and persistently stimulate "desire".

ID=16122011
So, this is not a recommendation but a warning.\nYou must not go forward more than this. Do you understand?

ID=16122012
... Ohhh.

ID=16122013
Yes, it was a wasteful thought when I thought about it.\nI am also really stupid ... Since I do not use my head, have they really started to solidify?

ID=16122014
Yes, it is. %username% was still having a hard time.\nSo this time ...

ID=16122016
What does that mean, I guess ... Are you sure you want to go ...? What?

ID=16122017
Give up, legendary soul worker.\nThis person does not change what he decided whatever happens.

ID=16122018
Do not be afraid to go forward does not match me!\nAlways be confident and entertain the world! so!

ID=16122019
... It is impossible.\nI seem to hide it now, but it certainly looked like%username% was upset even ahead.

ID=16122020
What on earth does you force impossible ...\nA girl there ... for Katherine?

ID=16122021
In order to stimulate me, it bothers me out to the vision of the deceased person and is insulting, does not it?\nCan you bear such a thing?

ID=16122022
Did you have the personality to think about other people to that extent?\nFor your enjoyment, you did not think too much of the life of others ...

ID=16122023
Er ... Why are you talking again?\nThis person, personality is slightly distorted, but basically it is a nice person trying to help humanity.

ID=16122024
...%username% Please understand what I said.

ID=56122001
I know, what does that mean?\nHowever, if you had treated me as a rogue until now, you had better stop quitting.

ID=56122002
The only thing I can do is to live happily like I like.\nNow if I feel happy with helping the world or helping a girl, just run it as it is?

ID=56122003
Anyway, I do not listen to your words.\n... Of course I will not listen to my words, though.

ID=56122004
Just give up as clean as you are.\nWe have no choice but to stop this person.

ID=56122005
... understood.

ID=26122001
... Please be careful.

ID=46122001
... What are you guys? Why are you here?

ID=46122002
I am sorry. Suddenly appeared.\n%username% met Amaryllis and was waiting for the real figure to wake up.

ID=46122003
Oh so.\nIf you talk like that, it sounds like a blackout that comes out after defeating Rasubosu?

ID=46122004
You seem to have been able to afford a light joke. It was good.

ID=46122005
Although it seems that it took longer than expected, I would like to congratulate you from the heart that I regained the body.\nIt was a bit of a hard time to materialize you who was only desire, but there are rewarding things.

ID=46122006
When I got out of the blanks and lost my memory, when I became completely strangely it was serious and rough!\nHahaha, I was giving up when I saw a figure that flew away as saving boring humans.

ID=46122007
... What did you say?

ID=46122008
If it was not even the woman I guess it was going well more ...\nWhat is it supposed to be because I am not late now?

ID=46122009
Let's go.\nI am preparing everything for you to go crazy.

ID=46122010
Hey, a little joke is too bad ...

ID=46122011
What's wrong? Maybe because I have not seen you for a long time, do not you get used to it?\nIf I do not know without trying to move, I will prepare the meat dolls ...

ID=46122012
If you send a bit of information to a foolish Star Forest it will do as usual, hahaha!

ID=46122013
Do not talk funny just listen, Talk about my story!

ID=46122014
Yup ...? Why are you in such a bad mood?\nYou were the "shadow" You occupied the body. You should be more pleased, are not you?

ID=46122015
The woman had a hard time bringing%username% who was banished from the blank.\nNo matter how much I dislike men,%username% does not understand my position ....

ID=46122016
Mashita ... Is not it deserial side?

ID=46122017
Desireia ... Do you want me to tell you what I mean?

ID=46122018
......

ID=46122019
Haha! How! I did not decently check, I talked to my old friend in a mood.\nI am very happy because it is a fighting friend who stamped humans with fun together in the blank ...

ID=46122020
Mistake mistake, do not mind!\nI do not see the extra like me like a complete black curtain! Hahaha!

ID=46122021
That word ... it was a bit too late to laugh and was not it?

ID=46122022
Hahaha! I was killed ...!\nThis is totally unexpected!

ID=46122023
That "shadow" is the soul spirit itself of Desire Energy.\nEspecially, the mass of desire of%username% was excellent among the many works I have seen.

ID=46122024
Even though you slightly touched your desire, it exploded beautifully.\nDesire calls even greater desire. That is why it expands endlessly.

ID=46122025
So it is a providence that 'shadow' designer is much stronger than weak emotional power like you.\nNo matter who whatever it is, the true desire is a complete body that eroded and dominated human soul energy.

ID=46122026
That's why I listen seriously ...

ID=46122027
Everything ... Why did you like dolls beyond "shadows\

ID=46122028
Oh ... it's time to give out a real intention?\nIt was good just because you did not like it from the beginning. I will vomit all things I know I will kill him halfway.

ID=46122029
Kufu ... ... haha!

ID=46122030
Well, that does not matter.\nThe prepared plan may be distorted somewhat, but it has not ended completely.

ID=46122031
Apparently the work seems to increase.\nAnything planned carefully to pull in%username% has all been wasted.

ID=46122032
Rather than waste ... It seems that it has become considerably troublesome.\nWell, let 's give the win to you guys this time only.

ID=46122033
Let's meet again.\nWhere ... I do not know how it will meet.

ID=36122001
Will it fade away, too?\nIt seems like a masterpiece thoroughly.

ID=36122002
... After all there was something.\nPerhaps there are reasons why an ordinary man could enter and leave the blank ...

ID=66132001
I came back,%username%!\nHahaha! This time also fought well!

ID=66132002
Do not close the mouth of the legendary soul worker who was doing a good arms work with this arm!\nOh, it seems just to come, so let's ask! What's wrong?

ID=66132003
... Apparently I seem to have underestimated%username%.

ID=66132004
As you guys,%username% has been growing forever.\nYou should not have to say that you should go home even if you still have a little anxiety.

ID=66132005
Ha ha ha! What is it! Now say something about%username%!

ID=66132006
Medium is exciting but exciting, I could do a little research personally.

ID=66132007
Hmm ...? What errands are you, suddenly ...

ID=66132008
I saw the guys who I saw at Grace.\nI have to go check it directly.

ID=66132009
Oh ... now I can also study the fantasy space.\nThere is no urgent business for the time being. Take care.

ID=66132010
... Did you find anything strange?

ID=66132011
Yeah, I found out ... but what is it?\nSkin I always have thin eyes There is a black man but can you tell me something?

ID=66132012
No ... I do not understand at all.

ID=66132013
I knew, I have to go check it out directly after all.\nWell then I'll be back.

ID=15903001
There will be nothing I do not know.\nDo whatever, remember!

ID=15903002
Rather, I would like to hear this.\nWhat was going on outside while I was feeling down?

ID=15903003
Do you think you would hear such a thing if you understand?\nIt will be fine as it is.

ID=15903004
The same thing is the same with me.\nTo be unable to fight properly and lose consciousness, it is miserable ...

ID=15903005
Which is the near soul worker? No wonder he ran away while he was talking.

ID=15903006
do not know. Even if I keep tracking if I understand it.\nSo how's Sarah sighing?

ID=15903007
Do not ask me.\nIt is serious that an accident happens all over the world now.

ID=15903008
...? Is there another problem occurring?

ID=15903009
After the woman of Zion and gold armor disappeared, abnormal phenomena occurred suddenly throughout Crow Dream.\nPerhaps, it's a bad situation.

ID=15903010
Is that ... right?\nIt is because of us ... not it?

ID=15903011
We just followed the order of the upper part.\n... But there is plenty of possibility to bear the responsibility.

ID=15903012
Haha ... I'm used to being touched with responsibility.\nIn the worst case, I will tell the members of the research team not to discipline.\nAlthough accusations are inevitable, they will not lose their workplace.

ID=15903013
It will be saved ... It will be a big problem if you lose the laboratory.

ID=15903014
I wonder if I'm making noise about such things now.\nNow, if it is a commander, would you be a commander, would you explain what I would do?

ID=15903015
In place of me I want to lower my head in front of a great man ... I want to say,\nTo ask such a thing for Seoul workers is a waste of talented talent.

ID=15903016
Dig Digs who ramped up to raise Zion also completely stopped functioning,\nThe reaction of a mysterious woman who appeared suddenly disappeared with the near soul worker.

ID=15903017
Unlike other areas, this place is quiet as never as before and no problems have arisen.\nIn this situation it is said that we are asking%username% from ....

ID=15903018
Then concentrate on finding other near soul workers.\nI am soon ... No, I will join the survey if I take a little rest.

ID=15903019
... It is a face that you are not scared at all.\nIf I was over there, my feet could tremble and I could not walk for a few days.

ID=15903020
Of course.\nIf you die in the battle you put your life on, it is rather amiable.

ID=15903021
This time I got in the way, but I will definitely win next time.

ID=15903022
Being fainter is a force ......\nOh, no, sorry. Please stop looking at the murderous eyes.

ID=15903023
... At that time I just did not know the enemy well.\nNext time we will riff you.

ID=15903024
Hahaha ... Keep the motivation till next time you fight.\nAlso, how about going to Amanda's place?

ID=15903025
I was running around here with a rough appearance from a little while ago.\nPerhaps it got something important. Go and ask.

ID=55903001
We will ask you in turn, so please talk one by one?

ID=55903002
I am sorry to have asked such a thing.\nI am also busy writing a report to excuse my great men.

ID=25903001
Please go to Dr. Sarah and Amanda. There may be some clues.

ID=65903001
Have a nice day. Somehow I came back.

ID=65903002
Welcome back%username%, there are no injuries?\nI was worried.

ID=65903003
The body was fine than I thought.\nMore then, although you have been told me more about the current situation.

ID=65903004
It's not as detailed as that. I know about the uproar in the entire Western Crow Dream.\nFrom all over the place we are in a hurry to support and we can not be sane.

ID=65903005
You can use that level of information. Can you tell me?

ID=65903006
... The cause of the noise is abnormal.

ID=65903007
Since the reaction of Zion has disappeared, abnormal whites appearing all over the world are activating activities.\nThe reaction of the near soul worker who tried pursuit has also completely disappeared, and it is a pity, but I do not think they will let her get their hands anymore.

ID=65903008
Is it supposed to give up tracking of near soul workers?

ID=65903009
... I understand your feelings, but you have to do that.

ID=65903010
More people are faced with a death crisis ....\nNear soul workers may be useless worrying because they can do something by themselves as long as they live.

ID=65903011
That's right.\nGiven that we are now facing the crisis of life now, the priority will be decided.

ID=65903012
I understood the story. So, we decide what to do after listening to the information Sarah has.

ID=95903001
Did you hear the news that anomalous space appeared from Amanda?

ID=95903002
I just heard a bit of a story that the situation is serious.\nI've checked the details about the matter, but would you please tell me?

ID=95903003
Well, there are cases in the past that blanks are opened all at once,\nIt has been hardly active recently, but it was not rare a couple of years ago.

ID=95903004
But the nature of the blank confirmed this time is different.\nSo now, in the Star Forest Union we are investigating the blank by calling it "ideal blank".

ID=95903005
What is different trait?

ID=95903006
I can freely go in and out.

ID=95903007
... That is interesting, do you want to know more?

ID=95903008
Common blanks suck humans inside and there is no way to escape?\nAnd there are side effects that people who come out of the blanks lose their memory.

ID=95903009
That freely comes in and out of the anomalous empty spaces that have emerged this time.\nIt can be said that it is not a white hole and a black hole but a gate or a passage connecting here and a blank inside.

ID=95903010
Thanks to you, the Starry Forest Alliance is currently fussing inside.\nIt seems that we may be able to finish the disaster of 15 years this time, and organize a dedicated team to investigate abnormal blanks at once.

ID=95903011
... Is it possible that Near Soul Worker suddenly disappeared due to abnormal void?

ID=95903012
I am not sure, but probably not.\nThere is no report that abnormal whites occurred around here, so it will not be sucked in.

ID=95903013
I'm sorry.

ID=95903014
What are you going to do?\nAre you going to search for the near soul worker who disappeared here for a long time, or are going to investigate abnormal empty space?

ID=95903015
The fact that it appears blank means that the lives of many people are in danger.\nI regret that I will postpone searching for those children.

ID=95903016
... Oh? I did not think that the lives of people unrelated to it are very meaningful for you.

ID=95903017
It is not worth the children to exchange for many other lives that are afflicted with the blanks.\n...... I am a little worried, though.

ID=95903018
Well ... certainly, keeping chasing what I do not know is not a reasonable judgment.

ID=95903019
Anyhow, it cooperates.\nThankful things are awful. Hahaha.

ID=95903020
... Please do not suddenly jump out from behind?\nI wonder if you do not have reasonable manners as a person.

ID=95903021
Haha, excuse me with joy when I heard that%username% comes about blanks.\nHow about Dr. Sarah together? Is the space itself the energy that Dr. Sarah studies?

ID=95903022
Of course it looks interesting, but I'm interested in the energy hidden here.\nBesides, unlike Amanda, you are incompetent.

ID=95903023
all right. It is impossible to forcibly take the ordinary people who do not want to go to drift.

ID=95903024
Let us suppose that we will go to work.\nIt seems that abnormal blank space is near Rocotown, so it is confluent on site.

ID=45903001
Oh,%username%! Long time no see, eh!

ID=45903002
I am happy to meet you. Were there any changes?

ID=45903003
Yeah, I do not have anyone to talk about such elegantly these days,\nI feel that%username% has returned.

ID=35903001
Although it is not very pleasant to treat like an unusual animal.

ID=35903002
Ah ha ... I'm sorry. I am glad anyway ...

ID=35903003
... Shall we change the topic?

ID=15913001
Anyway, it was just right timing. It is a big fuss during Locotown due to the recently generated blank.

ID=15913002
Can you see that blank floating in the sky of Locotown?\nIt is an order of magnitude larger than neighboring blanks.

ID=15913003
It is a place where I fell ...

ID=15913004
Recently, the phenomenal blanks have just started to revitalize suddenly.\nNot only that, it seems possible to enter and leave freely according to the research team's report.

ID=15913005
Thanks to everyone in Rocotown evacuating urgently ...\nOn the contrary, E.S. P, a fortified person unit of the Star Forest Alliance, is gathered at Locotown.

ID=15913006
E.S.P unit ...? I wonder what kind of organization it is.

ID=15913007
Actually, I'm not sure.\nI wonder if it is an abbreviation of "EsperStrikeProcess" and I think that it is a group of people with different powers.

ID=15913008
While the Stari Forest Alliance 's experts usually play an active part in various places,\nIt gathers only at the time of a truly important mission.\nIt seems to be called "process" with the meaning of a temporary system, not a team or organization.\n... That gathering means that this time it's so important.

ID=15913009
... That means that those entering the blank can at least protect yourself.\nI welcome you in an environment where you can fight without care of others.

ID=15913010
There are quite a lot of people in the research team and Fortune troops, so it does not mean that I completely ...\nAnyway, I wish you the other way.

ID=55913001
Oh, Miriam is also planning to come.\nThank you for your consideration. It is in the content of soliciting a request for rescue as before.

ID=55913002
Haha ... I will be careful ...\nI will do my best not to pull the legs of%username% and E.S.P troops.

ID=55913003
Yes, please repeat.\nBecause it is often a matter of disconcerting recently, because it is a series of battle if it enters the blank.

ID=55913004
%username% ... Are you not afraid of you?\nYou may fight unknown enemies in places you do not know at all ...

ID=55913005
Things that are likely to be said to be scary have experienced in general.\nThere is nothing to it like to put a life on fighting.

ID=55913006
Yes ... I can not understand it properly, but I can not say anything if you do.

ID=55913007
I do not know what's inside of it, so be careful.\nWe forget Fortune troops as soon as preparation is completed.

ID=25913001
I will follow you as soon as preparation is completed. Do not push yourself too much, do you? What?

ID=65913001
You came, I'm glad.

ID=65913002
It was quite early.\nIf there are such means of traveling, would not it have been better to ride with them?

ID=65913003
I also think so deeply, but it is a helicopter for executive team executives, so outside people are prohibited from boarding.\nIt seems to be an absurd privilege, but it is necessary to go back and forth between Ruin Fortress and work here.

ID=65913004
Although I am fighting so hard, I do not get on the helicopter.\nThe nature of the organization called Starry Forest Union is evident.

ID=65913005
%username% is not involved in the rank system of the Star Forest Alliance?\nIs it okay? People who sneaky like superior officers like me can easily move on the equipment of the union\nYou will miss the great man 's mood?

ID=65913006
It is a gathering of frantic people.

ID=65913007
There is no word to return.

ID=65913008
I will tell this story of the adult world to this place, it will be about to come to the point.

ID=65913009
Please do as soon as possible.

ID=65913010
I understand the desire to fight soon, but it is still a reality that we have not been able to conduct a decent survey yet.

ID=65913011
As you can see, it is the situation where only the initial team that was in charge of the rush arrived.\nBoth are planning to support Rocotown's Fortune troops and Grace City's soul workers, but now it's like this.

ID=65913012
... What are you doing with Kandas city?\nAlthough I remember that there was the most elite Field Force abundant in battle experience.

ID=65913013
If Candas' Force Strike unit, it was refused support request.\nIt seems that even repeating excuses of Seoul Junk's elimination even even orders of the general rank class.

ID=65913014
Well, it was a soldier unit after the Amaryllis incident, it would be useless.\nI guess I will only have the support of the Force Strike Forces stationed in other cities.

ID=65913015
It looks like me when I am mad at losing reason. ...\nRather, it is not Kandas city that I need help now.

ID=65913016
No, think carefully.\nIf you analyze this space and exit from the original, soul junk will never come out any more.\nNow if you concentrate only on here, you can solve other problems on your own.

ID=65913017
...... The line is passing.

ID=65913018
The Star Forest Association believes that the incident on this abnormal space is the end point of all disasters.\nIt is a pity that Ned Company betrayed at such a time.

ID=65913019
Such a pig group is just an eyesore.\nBecause I ought to be able to solve it enough by myself, do not worry.

ID=65913020
Haha, it was only a while since I lost to Zion, but only his mouth is fine.

ID=65913021
Will you decide after seeing whether it is only mouth?

ID=65913022
Bad, but now it is more important than battle.\nTalk with Amanda who is here with me!

ID=65913023
Oh, that person also came in.\nI wonder if I can do promises not to act on my own this time?

ID=65913024
Do you care about Mr. Hicks?\nIn fact the person himself regrets greatly.

ID=65913025
It is not what I can say without indiscriminate killing.\nHowever, as self-assertiveness is intense, I just worry about not repeating the same mistake.

ID=65913026
Anyway, because it is an important communication person, do not let me criticize and resign.\nHere we can not communicate anything without Amanda 's ability.

ID=65913027
... We will do our best.

ID=95913001
Huh

ID=95913002
A deep sigh. I wonder what's wrong.

ID=95913003
No ... I just curse my destiny.

ID=95913005
I think humans are consumables.\nI am measuring the limits of my patience.

ID=95913006
If you are not satisfied with coming to here, I wonder how you will get back over there.\nHere I will finish all of you.

ID=95913007
Ah ....\nIt was not a thing to say in front of a person fighting on the job at the work place, I am sorry.

ID=95913009
Yes, you get tired.\nI got accustomed to the soul worker's body and I could not sympathize with others' tiredness.

ID=95913010
Every time I get tired, I am fighting with my life every time ....\nI lost completely to Zion even before this ...

ID=95913011
I have not lost yet. Will you take care of your words?

ID=95913012
Oh, oh ... well ... well ... yeah ...%username% has not lost yet.

ID=95913013
... It sounds like I'm knocking in the air.

ID=95913014
Ahahaha ... Ah, apparently did you talk with someone over there?

ID=95913015
I saw the state, but it seemed to be doing some thought.\nI am going to understand the feelings that I do not want to be disturbed by my own time.

ID=95913016
I have been with you ever since we came in.\nThat's right, it seems to be a legendary soul worker "Teneburus" that appeared suddenly ten years ago and bounced back the strength of Vesi.

ID=95913017
Legend ...?

ID=95913018
Oh, I do not know. Suddenly appeared ten years ago,\nHe guided the soul workers and the disabled people and won the victory many times in the war with Vesi.

ID=95913019
Thanks to that, human beings could push back Vesi and enjoy prosperity.\nBut, doing something unreasonable five years ago ... No, you do not have to worry so far.

ID=95913020
The legendary soul worker ...\nI'm curious what kind of people are called legends.

ID=95913021
Do you try fighting each other's life?

ID=95913022
I am expecting it, but it is probably a different person or a fake person of the same name.

ID=95913023
... What do you say?

ID=95913024
The name "Teneburis" was very popular back then and there are things I used cat licks.\nEven small children knew their name.

ID=95913025
And then I saw directly with this eyes Tenebris was not that young.\nA bit more ... It was feeling old.

ID=95913026
The crucial thing is that Tenebris is dying five years ago.\nIt is officially death processing.

ID=95913027
I think I will realize what is true.\nBy the way it seems I know%username% ...

ID=95913028
Then I will talk to you directly.\nDiscrimination on whether the other party is making meaningless vigor or not is attached.

ID=45913001
I will see you. I'm%username%.\nI would like to say a few words.

ID=45913002
......

ID=45913003
Is not it rude to stare without saying anything?

ID=45913004
......

ID=45913005
... Anything is okay so please tell me?

ID=45913006
What happened ... ...

ID=45913007
Huh? Excuse me, but could you please say that again?

ID=35913001
You know Halle Estiah!\nShe ... ... where are you!

ID=15923001
To shout suddenly towards the partner for the first time,\n... You are not more polite than you imagined.

ID=15923002
Please do not be blurred!\nYou will not know the name!

ID=15923003
Hmm! I just decided that it was a question not worth answering.\nPlease do not decide the things of others without permission?

ID=15923004
That bored and prideful attitude ... I would like to say nostalgic ...\n%username% ...

ID=15923005
I do not know what people are losing among people, but please disappear from here right now!\nThis place is not the place where you are.

ID=15923006
Haa ... I really care about you ...

ID=15923007
Did you say Tenebrus?\nAs long as you see a loud voice like a wimp toward a lady, it seems that there is no mistake in being a spoof.

ID=15923008
Such a foolish name called a legend is such an abomination ... Is not she not ashamed?

ID=15923009
......

ID=15923010
......

ID=15923011
That eyes ... I guess you really do not seem to understand Hull Estea.

ID=15923012
You know the coffee you call espresso.

ID=15923013
Well, a different person whose name is the same ...?\nNo, it is difficult for others to mimic this voice and tone that scratches your ears ....

ID=15923014
I wonder if they are selling quarrels? I will be with you at any time.

ID=15923015
... I do not look like a lie or acting.\nI heard the story that%username% has lost memory, but I could not believe it. I am sorry to have a rude story to say that I met him for the first time.

ID=15923016
I hope the crack does not exist in the future relationship.

ID=15923017
Do not worry. It is not a fool who can not control his own emotion unlike you.

ID=15923018
Well ... again we apologize.

ID=15923019
If you apologize, why can you tell me why you are using other people 's own name?\nI heard that the name Tenebris is very famous.

ID=15923020
Tenebris is certainly my name, not the name of others.

ID=15923021
But beyond ... it is true that there was another Tenebrus outside the blank.\nNo, it is correct to call that body as its body.

ID=15923022
"One more person"? Did you say that you also made an alter ego?

ID=15923023
Does user%% know the existence of soul spirit in the human body?\nIt is a phenomenon that the will of a person separates from the body, but in many cases it is common for children to appear.

ID=15923024
Yes, I have seen you several times.

ID=15923025
That would be easy to understand.\nI became that soul spirit you know, it is a thing separated from the main body.

ID=15923026
Though you can not indeed see "a young child".

ID=15923027
The soul spirit can be any form depending on the desire of the main body.\nIn my case it seems that the mind that I thought "I would like to remain in the space" embodied on the day when I was kicked out of the blank.

ID=15923028
Who ...? So then, you left here in Seoul Spirit, the body died outside the blank. That's why there is no mistake.

ID=15923029
Yes ... I have recently heard that the story died five years ago.

ID=15923030
I am not interested in whether you are dead or not.\nBy the way, I heard that you remember what happened here, is it true?

ID=15923031
Given our attitude, my past may also appear.\nI regret that I can not prepare sweets, but will not I talk for a while?

ID=15923032
You mean that you want your past.\nI am sorry ... I can not say anything about this.

ID=55923001
It began again. I'm quite stubborn.

ID=55923002
... I will not deny.

ID=55923003
You certainly have lost memory.\nBut I still could not see if you really changed.

ID=55923004
If you give it to me straightforwardly, I can not completely trust%username%.

ID=55923005
I think the most doubtful you here is that you are entitled to use words as a credit?

ID=55923006
Because I also have convenience.\nCould you admit that?

ID=55923007
... Then I wonder if you can tell me the way to gain that trust.

ID=55923008
It is enough to act like usual.

ID=55923009
I will just watch over your work here.\nIf you judge that you are a trustworthy person ... I'll tell you all that time.

ID=55923010
That promise to talk about everything. I could hear it firmly.\nI will act like usual.

ID=55923011
Ignorant threatening people I am entertaining work that tears meat.\nPlease do not worry because it is a "regular work" you said.

ID=55923012
... Yes, I understand.

ID=25923001
... I suppose I will never meet again.

ID=65923001
Oh, you came to a nice place. We were about to finish the surrounding reconnaissance and we were about to organize a search group of places where we stepped on a little.

ID=65923002
It is finally it,\nI was about to lose the boredom and go home.

ID=65923003
I hope I find people sucked in this survey.\nEveryone who entered the blank is exceptionally powerful, so if you take them back, the war with Vesi ... I am looking forward to imagination alone.

ID=65923004
It is a story when it is found?

ID=65923005
Yes. As you said, I can not imagine optimism.\nI tried communicating in all directions with Amanda 's ability, but I did not get any income.

ID=65923006
So, should I search directly?

ID=65923007
I am sorry that I just left the job.

ID=65923008
Even if I pretend to be offended, I will be in trouble.\nIt is not being forcibly forced to do unpleasant work.

ID=65923009
A higher person will command, but at least I do not remember having ordered such an order?\nI do not like like using the kindness of the people who help with good intentions.

ID=65923010
Oops, I did not want to talk like this. Currently, our biggest mission is organizing the surroundings.\nSince it is a blank space unknown what will happen, we need to secure safety before other troops come in sequentially.

ID=65923011
Even if it is a flying summer insect,\nSpeaking of great people, they must do it.

ID=45923001
Search, cheers for good work.

ID=35923001
This ... it was quite annoying.\nNo way, the remnants of Rapid Flame of Grace City will appear to such a place.

ID=15933001
You have come so far that you have to see such barbarians ....

ID=15933002
Like whitespace in the sky of a human city, there is exactly the same blank space in the area of ​​Vesi?\nThere were no mystery or shit in those who welcomed me for the first time as soon as they came to the blank.

ID=15933003
Tenebris would know a bit about this situation. Can you ask me a moment?\nIf he can confirm even if he or she is living here originally, it will be easier to prepare for future measures.

ID=55933001
It is a name that can not be said to be reliable, but this time it can not be helped.

ID=55933002
Is not it unreliable, is it Mr. Tenebris?\nCertainly it is doubtful that the hero who died 5 years ago came home as a ghost.

ID=55933003
But it seems you do not feel like harming us?\nIt seems that they are not going to provide information.

ID=55933004
Personal opinion judged by sensation is also written in the diary.\nI will act with all things as enemies.

ID=55933005
So why not try to solve anything by themselves, why not try conversing?\nIf anyone continues to doubt that he is also an enemy, it will only narrow the choices.

ID=55933006
... There are a couple of things.

ID=25933001
Come now, please go to Tenebris.

ID=65933001
I came back, thanks for your hard work.\nNo way that it will fight with Vesi.

ID=65933002
It sounds like I was getting along with that word, Vesi.

ID=65933003
As I mentioned earlier, we avoided useless conflicts with the Vesi.\nBecause I was busy processing soul junk boiling in the blank.

ID=65933004
First of all, it is strange that Vesi is stationed in such a place.\nBecause the area around this area is an area where supplies were exhausted and abandoned long ago ...

ID=65933005
They are not just groups without thought.\nThere must be something planning to stay here.

ID=65933006
Whatever the reason, it appears that it appeared as if you predicted that you would come here.

ID=65933007
Do not worry.\nBecause I will search out all and destroy one by one.

ID=65933008
... I can not feel any tension.\nAre not you thinking of battle like a single entertainment?

ID=65933009
You know well.\nJust as I am fighting, I am fighting according to your words.\nAs a result, I am saving people as an incidental obligation.

ID=65933010
Incidental obligation ...\nIt is somewhat contradictory to use the word incidental to the duty of necessarily having to do.

ID=65933011
Sure it is, I think that this explanation is perfect for my duty to carry.

ID=65933012
Is it like being an excuse for yourself?\nIf there is a justification for protecting people, no matter how many kills an enemy\nThere is no one who thinks it is funny.

ID=65933013
... Apparently, I feel that something different is mixing with you I know.\nI'm worried if you lose reason and start to kill people disaster.

ID=65933014
So, do not worry.\nAs I mentioned earlier, it is not a fool who can not control his / her own emotions.

ID=65933015
Yes ... as I said, let's keep watching a little more now.\nI wish for yourself to be true.

ID=95933001
Well ... good ... ... Welcome back%username%.\nAs you can see, he is moving his heavy boxes now hard. May I borrow justice and power from Seoul workers?

ID=95933002
I'm sorry, I will not do miscellaneous matters.\nEven if it looks like a bad person, I do not want to show the way the case falls.

ID=95933003
Chit, I've got words that I do not want to help ....

ID=95933004
And%%username% is going to bring some of this.\nYou have to set up for surveillance search.

ID=95933005
Oh ...? I wonder whether he brought a machine to find a person.

ID=95933006
It is a spirit path finder supported from Heavy Gears of Grace City.\nMachine that is essential for reconnaissance mission to sense the flow of energy.

ID=95933007
Every survivor in the blank is a different person, so even if it is in a distant place, it is clearly perceived.\n... and it seems that great masters think.

ID=95933008
In the opinion of Dr. Sarah, if there are so many blanks to discharge so many workers and soul workers,\nIt seems that Seoul Energy is certainly infesting everywhere.

ID=95933009
It is not a problem that there is no reaction, it seems that there is too much reaction and it can not be distinguished which is which.\nEven though I know all that, I carry this heavy machinery. Because it is a command of a great san ... hahaha.

ID=95933010
If you work under other people, please bear that level of irrationality.

ID=95933011
Wow, that kind of look down on%username% ... I remember the officers.

ID=95933012
Good ... ... ... ah, already, shoulder ...! Why did I do this ...

ID=95933013
... You also suffered from miscellaneous matters.

ID=95933014
Epson staff members were under patrol and were left out because there were few staff members left in the garrison.\nIt is not dangerous for the Star Forest Association to fail to work properly without the help of such a weak woman.

ID=95933015
It is weak ... Pupu!

ID=95933016
Apparently, I guess I have to beat someone there.\nBecause I do not want to show much to you, will you close your eyes a bit?

ID=95933017
I will do it happily.\nPeople who insult women will get severely punished.

ID=95933018
wait a minute! Laughing with a story that it is so small ...!\nAh! painful! Do not beat me! Wow, this is lower!

ID=95933019
Well ... it's a lot of serious people working seriously.

ID=95933020
I agree, I work more seriously than I first met.

ID=95933021
That ... I also have a conscious mistake in Ruin Fortress.\nI do not know if I will be punitive for such a thing, but I want to be a force to finish this disaster a little.

ID=95933022
It is a pleasure to see how long that preparation will last.\nSo, what should I do? Would you take this lump of iron and install it somewhere?

ID=95933023
... ... Yes ... please ... I will ...

ID=45933001
Hahaha, I got a lot of effort.\nI ended up losing everything after all.

ID=45933002
As I fought enough to satisfy, I do not need to talk that I was not useful for anything.

ID=35933001
Well, it was within the forecast that the Spirit Pathfinder could not be used\n... It is different from what I expected.

ID=35933002
Yes, tell me?

ID=15943001
Spirit Pathfinder can not sense Seoul Energy at all.\nIncluding%username% and other energy from other people, all.

ID=15943002
It is contrary to the expectation that Seoul Energy is overflowing and can not be detected.\nSo I'm investigating the cause of a simple machine failure.

ID=15943003
What is the possibility of bringing a defective defective product?

ID=15943004
It's a brand new item that was newly introduced for blank search, so it can not be broken ...

ID=15943005
Oh, can you go to Amanda once more than that?\nI was looking for%username% earlier with a serious face.

ID=15943006
Well, even if you stay here, useful information will not come out.\nI will go.

ID=15943007
Surely, it is probably that such things as having laundered too much to dry up, or forgetting to close the main hopper of the stove.\nLooking for%username% is a washing line thick.

ID=55943001
... It is a joke that fraternity is felt.

ID=55943002
I was not a joke.\nJust show me your face once.

ID=25943001
Take care. I will see you off here.

ID=65943001
Ah. %username%, I came!\nI'm busy but I'm sorry for calling you one time.

ID=65943002
As I am used to being called, do not hesitate to say.

ID=65943003
What I called is ... a strange voice was heard.

ID=65943004
There were times when "laughing" or "came" and sometimes laughing awkward laughter.\nIt seems that it sounds close to%username%, but noise like a tinnitus is also occurring together and it's quite handy to analyze the content.

ID=65943005
I wonder if it sounds like a ghost ...? Considering the place, there is no wonder if it comes out.

ID=65943006
It is a place I want to say that it is not a ghost to flowing though ...\nI do not know anything yet.

ID=65943007
If you do not recognize%username%, you can only do it with caution as soon as possible.\n... I do not know what I can do even if I take care.

ID=95943001
Thank you for your hard work. Did the strategy succeed?

ID=95943002
I did not listen to what the machine says, all of it wasted.\nWell, I did not expect it from the beginning.

ID=95943003
... It seems that stress will accumulate ....\nDo you have to say that it looks rather rather clear?

ID=95943004
%username% ... You are satisfied by fighting again.

ID=95943005
Of course.\nThe weight of the bones touching the blade and the feeling that the cold sword cuts the meat does not accumulate.

ID=95943006
Is there a pleasant thing as when dealing with an enemy appealing with just a life with a look frightened to help you?

ID=95943007
It is thought of a murderer.\n... the same as that time.

ID=95943008
Would not it be more ideal to enjoy killing than being forcefully fought?

ID=95943009
What if you are going to do whatever blanks are gone?\nNow I am enjoying killing while doing various excuses, but if that subject disappears, you are ...

ID=95943010
They will attack people, perhaps without killing conscience and killing them in a blink of an eye.

ID=95943011
... You know, are not you?

ID=95943012
It is the third time to tell you, but I am not a fool who can not control his own emotions.

ID=95943013
... I calm the empty madness by doing the slaughter.\nI do not know when it was like this, but I understand about the nature of myself.

ID=95943014
There is nothing to say about irony ... There is space, so I can be with such humans like this.\nIf this is an ordinary world with no whitespace, the word meaning disaster may have been my name.

ID=95943015
... Are you thinking about something about your madness?

ID=95943016
It is not something like a countermeasure, but there are reasonable thoughts.

ID=95943017
I enjoy battle and slaughter.\nIf the world threatened by the blanks seeks combat actions,\nI will enjoy killing acts as they are requested.

ID=95943018
And simply fight to find stronger enemies.\nI will keep fighting all the time until this body can not bear it.

ID=95943019
If you can defeat the enemy, you win. Contributing to humanity today as well.\nAnd if you lose, you fight for humanity and duty. The world has enjoyed peace as ever.

ID=95943020
how is it? I can satisfy my desire fairly and be surrounded by applause until the time of leaving.\nWhat do you think is a good idea?

ID=95943021
It remains as it was.

ID=95943022
Since I do not know at all what is left as it is, do not abbreviate the subject?

ID=95943023
You are the same ... dealing very deeply with life.\n... It is not much different from%username% I know.

ID=95943024
Oh, I wonder?\nI would like to have a better alternative to say greatly admonish.

ID=95943025
Oh, I was here. I looked for%username%.\n... But the air here is stingy. Should I take it back?

ID=95943026
No ... I just reacted somewhat irritably.\nThere are not many things, so I would appreciate it if you would like to call on me.

ID=95943027
Okay ... Okay.\nFirst, how was the story with Amanda? As I said it was not a permanent business?

ID=95943028
He said he heard a ghostly voice.\nI could not listen at all.

ID=95943029
It is also an abnormal phenomenon ... again, there is a limit to what we can understand with our knowledge.\nOh, I wish I could really be saved if Tenneburi of the legend who lives somewhere knows something ....

ID=95943030
... The commander.\nI understand your feelings, but there are reasons why I do not speak to the blank ...

ID=95943031
Chit ... Also it ...\nRecently it seems to be popular to embrace the secret as much as possible.

ID=95943032
Well, that is postponement. %username%, It seems that we have located the headquarters of the people this time.

ID=95943033
Because the machine is useless, the E.S.P unit directly inspected it and identified the places where they gathered well.\nThere seems to be a machine that collects energy, Flame Tempest.

ID=95943034
Collect energy ... Can you do such a thing with Vesi who is outside?

ID=95943035
No, this is a machine made by a human who cooperated with Vesi.\nRapid Flame was positively using at Grace City.

ID=95943036
Oh, I can remember machines that had brought people to ruin and collect soul energy.\nI wonder why he is in such a place.

ID=95943037
Perhaps, when Vesi was sucked in, she probably came in with me.\n... Maybe there is the possibility that all the people left here are also sacrificed.

ID=95943038
Why do not you crush them all out?\nIt is more dull than cutting meat, but it is still enough to enjoy.

ID=95943039
After all, the solution of%username% is extreme.

ID=95943040
......

ID=95943041
What happened ... Tenebris.\nDo such a serious look.

ID=95943042
No ... nothing.

ID=45943001
It did really well!\nBecause of the active user%%username%, since the surrounding Rapid Flame retired, Fortune troops could enter.

ID=45943002
Thanks to you I was cowardly trying to escape from the blank by saying that I got hurt\nIt has become possible to stop it.\nFloof ... ...%username% everyone.

ID=35943001
Because I have done only what I should do, do not you express like a bad person?

ID=35943002
Hahaha, your humility.

ID=15953001
It seems that Miriam is coming at the dispatch of Fortune troops.\nIt seemed to be busy in assembling a medical tent, how about going to see him?

ID=55953001
It is a bad proposition, I will continue to serve as a greeting.

ID=55953002
Oh, can I please introduce myself if I go get together?

ID=55953003
... I'll leave it if you feel like it.

ID=25953002
You'd better go see Miriam.

ID=65953001
Oh,%username%!\nI am sorry, was it a bit late, is not it? It takes more time to prepare than I thought ...

ID=65953002
Do not worry because I do not feel lonely because there is not someone.\nI am happy to see you again.

ID=65953003
Yes, I'm happy too!\nI'm sorry just because my greeting has ended, but would you please tell us about the situation here?\nI have been preparing at Loco Town for a long time and I do not understand anything.

ID=65953004
I think that there has not been any particular change, except for killing Rapid Flame's Vesi.

ID=65953005
Vece who was in Grace City ... It is came to such a place ...

ID=65953006
About people sucked in? I heard that one person has not been helped yet though ...

ID=65953007
That ... I will answer only that the information you know is accurate.

ID=65953008
... that's it.\nI was going to treat those who first hurt when I came here ...

ID=65953009
Oh, I did not mean there was no harvest at all.\nA man named Tenebris is ...

ID=65953010
Tenebris ...! What?

ID=65953011
... It is quite understandable reaction.\nDo you know?

ID=65953012
Oh, he, well ... I was just surprised because it is the name of the legendary soul worker!\nWow ~ wow amazing ...

ID=65953013
... I can not make it fake.

ID=65953014
Surely, how about then? What did you talk with that person?

ID=65953015
I do not talk much.\nAs soon as I see my face I'm a person who will ruff my voice without greeting.\nThere is nothing to think about human nature.

ID=65953016
Yes ... I guess that's not such a thing ...

ID=65953017
After all it was familiar.

ID=65953018
I wonder what he's talking about Haha!

ID=65953019
Oh, sorry,%username%! I have talked too much about building the camp yet!\nThe talk is here! Will you come back later?

ID=65953020
see you soon! See you next time!

ID=65953021
... I am not good at secret affairs. truly.

ID=95953001
Thank you for your hard work,%username%.\nThis time I completely cleaned up.

ID=95953002
Do you understand it sooner or later?\nWhatever the reason, I am fighting for people.

ID=95953003
... I agree. But it is not enough yet.\nThere is something you want to check only one point for you.

ID=95953004
Mr.%username%, what are you putting your life on?\nIs there really no target?

ID=95953005
Did you mention it before? It is enough to fight and die.\nPerhaps, that last is best for me.

ID=95953006
It is quite vulgar.

ID=95953007
... I will make a mistake by now and still give it to you.

ID=95953008
No, I will not withdraw my remarks.

ID=95953009
Satisfying if you fight and die. And do you feel stupid and pride?\nIt seems that it seems as if she is desperately pressing a halibote called "wonderful" to merely thinking lighter.

ID=95953010
More than anything, you are fighting on the premise that you will die.\n... Is not she just wanting to throw away everything because she is mad with her madness?

ID=95953011
It's logic not worth listening.\nI do not ask other people's understanding.

ID=95953012
Being selfish as it does not care about the eyes of others is an act that is allowed only for young children.\nHowever, you are already an interlocutor and an organizational member belonging to an organization called the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=95953013
And it was not a nobleman of the historic Bloom fairy tales before that?

ID=95953014
... You know about Bloom fairy tales as well.

ID=95953015
It was a direct talk from you when I was in the blank.

ID=95953016
I used to be a lady with a nice mouth.\nThere is no memory.

ID=95953017
Please do not forsake your mind.\nIf you are you ... I believe you can make a different choice from that time ...

ID=95953018
Please remember ...\n... that life is not something you can just throw away for your enjoyment.

ID=95953019
Well, I will give you as a reference level.

ID=95953020
... After all, it seems that this story is told by me.

ID=95953021
I'm sorry I let you take your time.\nIt will not be long if you start talking.

ID=95953022
I do not know why I'm obsessed with it so far,\nI think that it is better for you to leave so far as to be selfish as you like to be good for not being dead.

ID=45953001
It seems that he was talking with the legendary soul worker,\nDid something happen?

ID=45953002
Separately. Do you have an obligation to tell you everything?

ID=45953003
I do not know why I get frustrated at all, but do not mind if I do not want to say it.\nOh, by the way it is obligatory to report to the commander, me, on the organizational system structure.

ID=35953001
......

ID=35953002
... But I will not let it dare because I do not want to die yet.\nAh. In other words, I have something I want you to help me with.

ID=15963001
Rapid Flame was completely exterminated, but there appeared to be a place where there might be a body.

ID=15963002
E.S.P unit has already abandoned the search because it is dangerous because you do not know what will come out.\nIf%username% is OK ...

ID=15963003
No, to be frank with you. I can not investigate unless it is%username%.\nPlease ask for my best regards.

ID=55963001
There is no reason to refuse if you can fight hard.\nIt is after confirming why it was expressed as "a place that might be acquaintance".

ID=55963002
It's hard to explain a bit, but as the word says "a place that might be acquitted".

ID=55963003
It was only strange that I was visiting a phantom or suddenly moved to a strange place.\nIf%username% wants to enjoy the thrill, we recommend you go once.

ID=55963004
I refuse things that are troublesome.\nBut there seems to be something more to get than other places, I will go.

ID=25963001
Survey, thank you.

ID=45963001
The meat and the machine have cut enough to get bored, but I did not think that it would be a ghost.

ID=45963002
What was your impression of fighting with that?

ID=45963003
It was a feeling of cutting haze and clouds. I felt better feeling like holding more insects.

ID=45963004
It is confirmed, but the enemy that appeared at that time was similar figure to the enemy who%username% fought before ... Is that so?

ID=35963001
There is no objection.\nThere is no confirmation about small fish, but since the huge doll that appeared at the end can not be forgotten.

ID=35963002
However, I did not understand anything after all.\nHowever, Tenebrus who was living here may know something. Why do not you ask?

ID=15973001
... I will depend on him for something.\nEven though you are a survey team, you do not want to investigate?

ID=15973002
There is no other person to depend on because there is no other one to depend on?\nIf you are dissatisfied, I will go with you, so I beg you.

ID=55973001
If you were planning to come, why do not you spend a relaxing time together with the men?

ID=55973002
Is not it because there is no story of a person who actually played an active part in the field?\nJust keep silent.

ID=25973001
Now, let's go early.

ID=65973001
The weak face, if you see it over and over in a day, I will miss it.

ID=65973002
Haha, I have no greetings today, do you?\nAnyway, thanks for your hard work.

ID=65973003
Do not say anything unnecessary, just talk about what you need?

ID=65973004
Tenebris.\nIs there anything you can know about what%username% is experiencing?

ID=65973005
This is a place full of blanks, phenomena which can not be explained by common sense.\nBecause it is filled with Desire Energy, no matter what happens, there is nothing to be surprised about.

ID=65973006
Desire Energy ... ?! Are those words serious?

ID=65973007
Oh, did not you know?

ID=65973008
I do not know or nothing, how can I investigate the inaccessible blanks.

ID=65973009
I see ... I will have to explain from the nature of the blank.

ID=65973010
The blank is not a natural disaster nor a special space, it is a mass of enormous designer energy.\nOne big energy with the desire to "breathe everything".

ID=65973011
Therefore, in this area where we stand, Desire Energy is more familiar than air.

ID=65973012
I see ... was there reason why the Spirit Pathfinder that senses soul energy did not work?

ID=65973013
The reaction of Seoul Energy was drowned out by overwhelming Desire Energy and I could not sense anything.\nIt would have been noticed if Dr. Sarah was there, but anyway it is not when you need to say a human.

ID=65973014
No, wait ...?\nAmanda 's communication capability will be using Seoul Energy, so why can you use it?

ID=65973015
Soul Energy and Desire Energy should have had the property of extinguishing when they hit each other?

ID=65973016
......

ID=65973017
Well, if you say that,%username% can not use the power of soul worker,\nI should have said that it was good.

ID=65973018
For the time being, I will ask the person of the discrimination group investigating this energy to dispatch in the blank as promptly as possible.\n%username% is resting during that time.

ID=65973019
If you have tea time you will enjoy chopping bad taste.

ID=65973020
It is dangerous to move unnecessarily, as I understood that this is the base of Desire Energy.\nYou have to know in advance what the influence is at a minimum.

ID=65973021
Now, as work gets full - blown, I do not have time to rest, so let 's take a rest now.\nThis is a command as a commander.

ID=65973022
So it is necessary to take a separate rest ...

ID=65973023
By the way, Miriam seems to have been suffering from something before.\nWill you meet once and give me a consultation?

ID=65973024
... I understand.

ID=95973001
I am happy, I came to see it because I got time.

ID=95973002
Oh, well ...

ID=95973003
... You seem to have fallen into really big trouble.

ID=95973004
Oh ... well ... there is a little personal concern.

ID=95973005
The pain will double if you understand the wounds, but the troubles become light enough to divide.\nI will give you my opinion, so if you can confidently disclose my problem I will be happy to take a consultation.

ID=95973006
That ... that is not so serious! Just ... well ...

ID=95973007
I was talking with Tenebris earlier, did not he?\nDid not you talk something about Tenebris, me?

ID=95973008
I will declare, but I have never heard of your name as one letter.

ID=95973009
Oh, yeah ...

ID=95973010
What is? Can you pronounce the words firmly?

ID=95973011
Haha ... that's right ...\nOh, I want you to listen to the trouble as you said! If you have time, can you consult us?

ID=95973012
There is no reason to deny the words I said from my side.

ID=95973013
... you know what.

ID=95973014
Well, that's not my story, but my friends! There was a man who used to be friends ...\nBut that person may have lost his memory and may not remember anything ...

ID=95973015
It looks like a novel, but the real story ... ha ...

ID=95973016
... Do you need to dare to understand intentionally, even though you are talking about yourself?

ID=95973017
... Really a friend's story! Because it is not my story!

ID=95973018
Looking at the spot that makes it so far, there are reasons.\nOkay, I will make assumptions on the story of my friend.

ID=95973019
So ... ... anyway!

ID=95973020
That friend likes that person ... so, I want to help you. I'm troubled ...

ID=95973021
When that friend met with a guy ... I wonder if I should say a voice ...?

ID=95973022
The man seems to be unaware of his friends ... I am not in the blank ... friends in the hospital! There is no compensation that I have met the man.

ID=95973023
If you want to conceal what you are talking about, I wonder if it's a bit more plausible ......

ID=95973024
Haha ... anyway. When you call out, you may be hurt if anyone eyes you ...\nTrue, I wonder what I should do ... I'm troubled ...

ID=95973025
Well ... I will check it once, but is the name of the man Tenebrus?

ID=95973026
Yup! Tene ... no! It's about another man who likes my friends!

ID=95973027
I will assume you are Tenebris and will speak.

ID=95973028
That man ... Just a fake face It is a kind of indulgence than necessary.\nAs if you were justice just as hypocritical,\nHe likes to enter wisdom to others.

ID=95973029
Those who are just cynical about the disadvantages of others with blind belief that they are right like that,\nI think it would be better to stop it.\nEven if you are a guest at our house, it is the level you have to pay for the money.

ID=95973030
What ... what are you talking about!\nNot Teneburi ... but the man of the story is not such a person!

ID=95973031
... Is he really going to hide it?

ID=95973032
No ... I do not know anything! It is neither hypocritical nor unnecessary! I was always fighting Vesi for everyone!\nEven when I get injured in the war like everyday and come back for my treatment,\nI was smiling while saying that I was glad I was helped!

ID=95973033
It's only a few days since I met you, I know what you understand ...

ID=95973034
Well, the answer came out.

ID=95973035
... What are you talking about?

ID=95973036
Now I've confirmed how much I thought of that man by anger that you showed me.\nIt is quite serious to get such angry with a little insulting, right?

ID=95973037
Confirmation ... No way, no words bothering words ...?

ID=95973038
No, they are all true.

ID=95973039
......

ID=95973040
Anyway, your action now that your action for that person is serious.\nIf you give up talking for the reason that it is frightening to confirm, someday you will regret it with shedding tears.

ID=95973041
That's ... That's right.

ID=95973042
Yeah ... I need not hide, I do not need to be shy ...\nIf I want to talk like old days and laugh together, now I have to call out ...

ID=95973043
I am fortunate if it helped.\nWell then, I will be looking forward to the fight soon.

ID=95973044
Oh, yes! Thank you,%username%! Please come and see me again!

ID=45973001
Is your vacation already OK?

ID=45973002
I did not need rest from the beginning so I will do my job.

ID=45973003
I do not have any bad taste like calling me immediately after issuing a vacation order.\nI dislike most as one of the victims. That's it.

ID=45973004
When you have to take a day off, take a good rest.\nIf I have power, I intend to fight against the power of the darkness for the security of the rest of the soldiers.

ID=45973005
Do not let me say it twice.\nI say that I did not need it from the beginning.

ID=45973006
Well ... I see ...? I really appreciate it if you will help me ...\nIs it really okay?

ID=45973007
I understand that the soul workers can not feel tired ...\nEven so, I really do not want to say battle to school girls many times.

ID=45973008
I already live my life far from my normal students.

ID=45973009
Hmm ... If so, I'm sorry but I beg you to thank you ...

ID=45973010
The other day, other than%username% was the place where the survey was done, and similar illusions appear.

ID=45973011
The phantom itself was cleared up by the E.S.P unit ... something a little troubled happened

ID=45973012
What is trouble?

ID=35973001
A clown clown, Edgar appeared.

ID=35973002
... It's more interesting than I expected.

ID=15983001
Although it is an illusion,%username% who is engaged in battle as being a Vesi belonging to a danger class is the most suitable.\nOriginally I was planning to let our E.S.P unit process it, but it is a fact that it is a burden.

ID=15983002
Please let me go at once. It seems to be enjoyable for the first time in a long time.

ID=15983003
It looks very happy.\nIs that so strong?

ID=55983001
Secondly there is a fight there,\nI can not cut that spooky face many times.

ID=55983002
... Really.\nWell, for now, I will ask you again this time.

ID=25983001
Have not you gone yet? Hahaha, you can take a day off if you want to have a break.

ID=45983001
Good job. You returned well.

ID=45983002
... After all, the texture when harvesting was not good. Others have nothing to say.

ID=45983003
Ahahah, for the time being we must fight against those guys, but be patient.

ID=45983004
By the way it seems I was talking to someone during the investigation ...\nDid something happen?

ID=45983005
It looks like you heard a silly hallucination, but you do not have to worry about it.

ID=45983006
It's not ...\nNo, it's impossible ...

ID=45983007
Oh, did you come by Tenebris?\nIf you have something to know, please tell me everything.

ID=45983008
Because it may be my misunderstanding.\n... It is true that I want you to be a misunderstanding.

ID=45983009
I have to tell any misunderstanding.\nWill you tell me so that our investigation will be furious?

ID=45983010
I am sorry, but I can not say that.

ID=45983011
A bit Tene, we met someone who was not flexible like you before we came here.\nHe told me not to say anything until after the incident eventually told me to tell me.

ID=45983012
We learned then. It is said that you should keep listening persistently even if you say that you do not want to say it.\nIf you do not say it now, you will witness the persistence of our research team?

ID=45983013
I am also suffering from a feeling of wanting to say ...

ID=45983014
So why?

ID=45983015
... Here I say,%username% is dangerous.

ID=45983016
...%username% is?

ID=45983017
If it was my life, it will be a long time since I ceased to use my mind.

ID=45983018
life? I am pleased if it can do with that.\nBecause the lives of many people will be threatened.

ID=45983019
If so, should you also tell me to pay attention with me?

ID=45983020
Of course it is true, but there are circumstances.\nThe truth I know is different in dimension than what you have ever experienced.

ID=45983021
While giving only insecurity, it is noisy that what is attention is what.\nIf you can not say anything, can you keep silent? Because I care very much.

ID=45983022
No, there is a remedy.\n... It is the only wish I will tell you.

ID=35983001
Leave here. And here we are not somewhere to fight for people.

ID=15993001
There is no reason to be convinced, is not it somewhat terrible to say "walk away" unilaterally?

ID=15993002
Yes! It is too cruel! Even if it is said that we should leave in one direction, we are in trouble!

ID=15993003
In the first place, if%username% leaves here, it will interfere with the investigation of the blank.\nPerhaps you give up the investigation and you may have to return the baggage together!

ID=15993004
Is the Star Forest Union a group that can not do anything because there is no soul worker alone?\nEven if%username% alone is gone ...

ID=15993005
It's not a simple dependency problem! Those who do not understand do not speak!

ID=15993006
Declining morale of the survey team is also a problem.\nBecause of the concern that you may be terrible at times, the number of people who will leave will be going on.

ID=15993007
In the first place, there are many people who participate in the survey just because there are soul workers.\nIf%username% is gone, the investigation team will lose its root.

ID=15993008
Of course%username% Although the collective dependence is concentrated on one person.\nWe have to understand that the investigation can proceed because there is the%username%.

ID=15993009
If so, please leave everyone.\nIt is dangerous to stop%username% in this abnormal space.

ID=15993010
I can not do that! You may have clues to save the world here.

ID=15993011
... Of course it is important to know that if you return home by hand, you will get painful eyes from great people,\nThat's a personal matter ...

ID=15993012
It is a blank space that can finally be investigated by finding things.\nIt's been 15 years since the blanks were opened, and there is no precedent as one.

ID=15993013
I can not give up the opportunity I might grasp the clues to save the people suffering from the blanks.\nAnything is okay, I will not go back until I get results here.

ID=15993014
I am pretty enthusiastic this time, right?

ID=15993015
I have no will to motivate myself not to want to.\nThere was no reason I came up to the commander at this age.

ID=15993016
Besides, there is no one to come here to take the command except me.\nThe wonderful one will stand out on his own regret. So, I have to do it.

ID=15993017
It is more stubborn than I thought ...\nLet's ask%username%, Are you sure that you can bear with whatever happens?

ID=15993018
If I say "no problem" many times from now, can you convince your slightly smaller brain?

ID=15993019
If you stay here like this, you will certainly have a day to regret.\nThat's why I'm listening.

ID=15993020
You certainly are strong.\nBut before then it was an ordinary human being, is not he a student?

ID=15993021
It is a time when emotions appear most clearly and clearly, and it is also a time when emotions can not be controlled at the same time.\nEven if you recognize yourself as strong, there are things that will be broken by something that is nothing.

ID=15993022
Do not worry.\n... The work worthy of being broken has been experienced many times already.

ID=15993023
......

ID=15993024
It's not easy to break pride?\nBefore that, I would obediently obey other people's words.

ID=15993025
No. I think that I just do not understand how serious the current situation is.\n%username% is also stubborn than it looks.

ID=15993026
I am sorry, but I will tell you the place from now on so that no one will be asked.\nPlease follow me where I was.

ID=55993001
Hmm, if you can not use words even with violence?

ID=55993002
Do not worry. With this body that is only a soul, you can not harm you.

ID=55993003
I'm sorry, can the commander wait in another place?

ID=55993004
If it's an important story, I think it is necessary for me to be a commander as well.

ID=55993005
It is a personal story.\nIf you want to know the contents, please listen to me personally later.

ID=55993006
However, I do not know if%username% will talk.

ID=55993007
Well ... I am worried about what you are talking about ...\nThere is no help if it is a personal story. understood.

ID=25993001
... Please tell me later what you talked about.

ID=65993001
I have been waiting for you.\nActually ... I am still wondering what I should do about this story.

ID=65993002
It is disgusting, I guess.

ID=65993003
Yes. Even if you hide it any more, you will only buy doubts and resentment from you.\n... I do not know what will happen to the results, but I will prepare and talk about it.

ID=65993004
There is one thing I want to confirm just before entering the main subject.\nI told you heard a voice of unknown identity in the previous strategy, can you tell me more about that voice?

ID=65993005
It was a familiar voice, a voice that whispered myself.

ID=65993006
It resembled%username% 's voice ... is not it?

ID=65993007
It may be self-destructive, but there is no other voice to stroke the human nerves so much.

ID=65993008
... Then you do not have to hesitate to tell this content.

ID=65993009
At first, I will ask only one.\n%username% is Halle Estiah, Erwin ArcLight, Stella · Univel. Do you know about these three people?

ID=65993010
It is a name I do not remember at all.

ID=65993011
Clearly ... Is not it possible to imagine even a kind of small clue?

ID=65993012
It does not matter how many times you listen.

ID=65993013
The name I mentioned at the moment is Desirey Workers who were active in the blank.\nWe absorbed enormous power here, the territory of Desire, and slaughtered people indiscriminately.

ID=65993014
Desire worker ... Is it different from soul workers?

ID=65993015
Yes. There is a difference in the name of energy to use and the driving force of power, but you can think that it is almost unchanged.

ID=65993016
But like Vesi they were just loyal to their "desires".\nSimply hate human beings and enjoy violence ... Also, it was simply the reason that it is fun to die people.

ID=65993017
They already missed the ordinary as a human being.\nI deny everything except myself ... It was exactly how I realized desire.

ID=65993018
I fought with them many times in the blank.\nWake up as a "true" soul worker ... to protect people and "justice".

ID=65993019
As you can see now, thanks to that, I was able to become "a soul worker of justice".

ID=65993020
It is similar to mine, but it seems to be different people.

ID=65993021
Well ... if you forgot everything, it may be natural to say so.

ID=65993022
... You still have something to say?

ID=65993023
Yeah, please listen to a little more.

ID=65993024
I was inhaled in the blanks and I gathered people and made an organization named "Dark Moon Nocturnal Union"\nSomehow survived.\nWhile battling Seoul Junk and a designer worker striking humans, I barely lived everyday.

ID=65993025
In such a situation ... There was one designer worker that I brought directly after capturing.\nDespite being completely restrained and unable to resist,\nI was wearing eyes that seemed to kill someone by now.

ID=65993026
... What is the name of that designer worker?

ID=65993027
The condition was serious, and several bones of arms and ribs were broken. If the treatment is delayed, the right eye is on the verge of blindness.\nIt was rather an enemy that the advantage of being less tired easily fought until the body broke.

ID=65993028
Even so, he smiled like crazy.\nI guess I was going to fight until my life has expired and I can not move.\n... There is no explanation other than a rabid raging dog groaning with life.

ID=65993029
Say no, reduce your name.

ID=65993030
... In order to tell the expression, I noticed without needing to say, did not I notice?

ID=65993031
......

ID=65993032
I said that you again appeared in front of me, fighting to save humans.\nYou entrusted to madness and killed a lot of people for your own enjoyment.

ID=65993033
I still can not forget the crazy smile that you showed me.\nBut ... you have forgotten everything and have come to see me again.

ID=65993034
What are you going to do if you deny that I'm a lie?

ID=65993035
No, you absolutely can not deny.\nIt is because you are the one who never cares the life of others, your life ... absolutely.

ID=65993036
In that case let's change your way of saying.\nI am a stranger now.

ID=65993037
There is no word to return if you died to the people I killed in the past and said Atonement.\nBut, at least from now on, I will fight only to protect people.

ID=65993038
I know that there is value to others' lives, even though there is no value in my life.\n... That child taught me.

ID=65993039
No. "Mission sense" trying to protect the person you have is due to the loss of memory that happens when it is discharged from the blank.

ID=65993040
The one left in%username% who lost memory of 15 years after escaping from the blank,\nI think that it was only desire that lost purpose.

ID=65993041
And the first thing you jumped into your eyes is "human crisis".\nDesire of Desire who lost its purpose was replaced with the desire of "to save humanity".

ID=65993042
Enjoying killing If you fight to protect people themselves are contradictory\nHave you ever doubted?

ID=65993043
Does that mean I'd like to say that the mind I'm trying to protect people is manipulated and created?

ID=65993044
Desire created by Desirey Energy.\nIt is neither more nor less than that.\nThe essence of%username% has not changed since long ago.

ID=65993045
Still thought that I would watch over the first time I saw you here ...\nI also expected you to come out of my madness and fight for people.

ID=65993046
... But, as you can see, only the conclusion that you inherently did not change appeared.

ID=65993047
But if%username% will stay here, your shadow will be someday ...\nPast%username% will swallow you.\nI had to absolutely avoid that much.

ID=65993048
I understand your story.\nSo what do you say to me?

ID=65993049
You are different from you in the past. You can still escape from here enough.\nSo please, please leave from here.

ID=65993050
It is a boring conclusion.

ID=65993051
... I did not want to persuade you with such words.

ID=65993052
If you stay here as it is, one day you will kill humans.\nThe person you saw, the person you saw, the people you meet from now, all the people.

ID=65993053
Does%username% still stay here?

ID=65993054
......

ID=65993055
It may not have been necessary to say so far.\n... yet you seem to have a human heart ...

ID=65993056
What is your heart, what do you know of me?

ID=65993057
It is a word as a person who fought with your life on the fly and protected the murderers with their life.

ID=65993058
The more you speak, the more you get angry.\nIt seems not worth listening to any more talks, I will go.

ID=95993001
Ha ha ha! Did you ask all the stories?

ID=95993002
Tenebris was trying to hide it, but let's hear from himself.\nNow,%username%! Share important information for the future of humanity!

ID=95993003
......

ID=95993004
Um ...%username%?

ID=95993005
Why do not you check it yourself?

ID=95993006
Uh, why did you suddenly be in a bad mood ...?

ID=95993007
Okay, will you not talk to me?

ID=95993008
Eh ... ... If you have anything in trouble, I can help you ...

ID=95993009
Would you please leave me alone?\nThis is my personal problem.

ID=95993010
... Yes, I understand.

ID=95993011
It seems that it is not content that you can speak lightly from the expression.\nIf you do not want to talk, I will give up listening too.

ID=95993012
We are a smart research team that actually conducts surveys, tracks and finds information,\nIt is not a detective who interrogates people and makes information.

ID=95993013
Does not sticking?\nYou seem to have a head to think a little.

ID=95993014
I do not know what I talked about, but I am very tired.\nFor a while leave the survey to us and rest a little%username%.

ID=95993015
... Is it 僭 越, can I ask you only one person personally?

ID=95993016
Although I can not refuse to be polite,\nCan I relate to personal problems?

ID=95993017
Answer the question ...! What is the soul worker you think?

ID=95993018
Mu ... Do not suddenly ask questions that are difficult to answer.

ID=95993020
At one time I used the soul worker like a tool, but that was an old story.

ID=95993021
Is that the Stary Forest Association thinking that Seoul workers and experts are "tools"?

ID=95993022
Well, from the point of view of the great men, I and the general soldiers are treated the same,\nAt least I think that I should never forgive people like "old-handed" like old days.

ID=95993023
Were the other commanders handling me as a tool?

ID=95993024
That's what the current commanders have seen in the past the disinterested people used in the war\nThere will be a fixed idea.\nIt is strong and it is a dangerous existence which is not too tired even if fighting, so you should use it.

ID=95993025
Think about it, would not it be hard if existence that has strength far apart from humans also causes a revolt?\nSo it seems that in the past Star Forest it was trying to control from the mental side.

ID=95993026
But I ... I will change that stereotype from my generation.\nTherefore, while grinding sesame to the great people, they are hitting ...

ID=95993027
I am going to use it as a tool against the different persons and soul workers who have been used as tools in the past\nI also think that it is an apology.

ID=95993028
... There are times when we have a decent story unexpectedly.\nThe appearance that I saw in Ruin Fortress looks like a lie.

ID=95993029
At that time it was a bit desperate.\nI will do it when I do it! my mother!

ID=95993030
Well, at best let's do our best.\nI will excuse you because I do not have any further interest in your personal story.

ID=95993031
Ha ha ... ... Yes, let's meet again.

ID=45993001
Hello,%username% ... I am frustrated ...

ID=45993002
You understood well.\nI am a little disturbed by the strife with Tenebris.

ID=45993003
I thought that it was bad for you ... Actually, I was listening to the story secretly.

ID=45993004
......

ID=45993005
Haha ... the feeling that everything I know is denied ...\nIt was shocking beyond my expectation.

ID=45993006
It was said that I am a murderer who kills people.\n... Miriam is also terrible with me?

ID=45993007
Actually, I was afraid since long ago ...

ID=45993008
Still ... I do not think%username% here is so terrible.

ID=45993009
Even though I hear his words, I can say that.

ID=35993001
... that.\nIf you do not mind, are you going to talk a little bit here?

ID=35993002
of course. Rather, I'd like to ask from here.

ID=16003001
It's a bit embarrassing story, but ...\nThere used to be a longing thought that%username% was really amazing.

ID=16003002
Do not you care about others' eyes or words, do you do what you ought to do?\nOf course there are people who will be estranged because of that,\nIt was very enviable for me who always lived while following the words of others.

ID=16003003
Then I made a mistake on the person I admire.\nI am just rampant without permission.

ID=16003004
I do not like being such a madman, I adore you ... it will be a stain point.

ID=16003005
Ah, sorry. I apologize first, but you are not crazy than I thought.

ID=16003006
What do you mean?

ID=16003007
A real madman does not say that you are crazy.\nI can not act with confidence in my actions.

ID=16003008
I can understand well because I have seen a lot of people who are "really" crazy in front of the danger of death.

ID=16003009
... That was right. You were one who stands on the battlefield.

ID=16003010
So please do not blame yourself like%username%, crazy or not worthy of life.

ID=16003011
Of course there is something in the past with Tenebris and seems to have been said to be a villain who killed people ...\nStill, together the people of Rocotown ... You helped a lot of people.

ID=16003012
So forget the sinful past, will you know the importance of your life?

ID=16003013
... Because it is someone else's, you can say something ridiculous.

ID=16003014
If your parents or you are the one that I killed, can you say something like this now?

ID=16003015
%username% in front of me is not such a person.\nBecause I feel guilty in my past, who ask questions to me.

ID=16003016
It is conveniently interpreted ...\nPlease know only that I am not so wonderful as you think.\n... I do not want to talk any more, so I will go to other places.

ID=56003001
No matter what you say, I believe it is a worthy person.

ID=56003002
Really ... It is a stubborn person.

ID=56003003
You changed a lot.\nWhen I came to Loco Town for the first time, when I left Rocotown ... and after experiencing lots of things, now also in this moment.

ID=56003004
So I believe that you can do it well.\nAnd they will fight for people from now on.

ID=56003005
... Be yourself.

ID=56003006
Yup! Make it selfish!

ID=26003001
Huhu, do you have anything you would like to discuss further?

ID=66003001
I came, Tenebris.

ID=66003002
... I hoped it would not come again.

ID=66003003
Apparently, as far as looking at all the expressions, I seem to have brought back the worst reply.

ID=66003004
Whether it is the worst or not, you decide.\nAs you think carefully, it seems you did not have to be swayed by the words of others.

ID=66003005
I know about myself the most.\n... I will give you some light meditation on behalf of others.

ID=66003006
I also as a soul worker who fought for justice at a glass cover camp.\n... I only wish that%username% of the era that I know will not wake up.

ID=66003007
... I persuaded as much as I could, so I have no way to stop you.\nYou seem to have no choice but to watch how you progress from now on.

ID=66003008
Haha, will you still remain! Thank you,%username%!\nI did not get sneaky by words of ghosts!

ID=66003009
It is not a ghost, please refrain from words.

ID=66003010
But bad news to%username% who made a new determination here.\nIt seems that Junk Knight who made Kandusity disturbance was found at a time.

ID=66003011
Oh, it is a bad guy who was smelly.

ID=66003012
It is Seoul Junk based on soul workers.\nThere is a high possibility that it appears as an illusion like before, but it is hard to say that it is weaker than the real one considering the precedent.

ID=66003013
There are only about%username%, the same soul worker, as a countermeasure.\nI just asked something difficult to complain.

ID=66003014
It does not matter, I will erase it as a change of my mood.

ID=66003015
You do not even feel tired.\n... Was there something that got the power like?

ID=66003016
There is nothing in particular.\nHowever, only a blank answer remains as to whether her conclusion is truly correct.

ID=46003001
......

ID=46003002
If it is a mission report, should not I go to Martin instead of me?

ID=46003003
There was a slightly disgusting thing and I just stopped by.\nBecause it is very rude, please do not pry every one.

ID=46003004
Although it is rude, there are still things I have to say.\nThis time is really dangerous.

ID=46003005
In the previous strategy%username% heard a very clear auditory listening ... is not it?\nThat is a proof that you are little bit eroded by Desire Energy.

ID=46003006
If you noticed how many people will be sacrificed by an unnecessary battle ... even now ...

ID=46003007
You can tell, how about defeating that ...

ID=46003008
......

ID=46003009
... Do you think that you can solve anything by fighting and winning?

ID=46003010
Yes, of course.\nSo far we have solved so, and we are planning to fix it in the same way.

ID=46003011
The amendment that made me irritate is properly done!

ID=46003012
Please calm down,%username%.\nI understood the feeling well.

ID=46003013
If you want to calm me, tell me how to beat that!

ID=46003014
No, I will not say that.\nEven if you say,%username% will never feel calm.

ID=46003015
The blank stimulates the trauma and fear of the targeted human being, and guides the target to want "power".

ID=46003017
Then what do you say!

ID=46003018
Oh, I was here.%username%! It's a request for a fairly dangerous work from the search group.

ID=46003019
For what?

ID=46003020
Eh ... why are you so angry?\nMaybe it's a bit dangerous, so please calm down and ask me.

ID=46003021
Oh, it is okay. I think that this feeling will be clearer if we reap something, please.

ID=46003022
Codename Amaryllis, which is the result of a research by Ned Company which made Temporary Candasity a noise.\nDoes%username% know this name?

ID=46003023
... Amaryllis ...!

ID=46003024
... It is rough. Looking at that figure, it seems that the blanks have prepared a fairly powerful toy this time.

ID=46003025
I was troubled ...\nAccording to the report,%username% is Catherine, host of Amaryllis ...

ID=46003026
Would you be silent for a moment?

ID=46003027
Excuse me.\nI told extra things.

ID=46003028
But it certainly became it.\n%username%. You must never fight here any more.

ID=46003029
Your desire for anger is now uncontrollable as far as I can see.\nIt will absolutely take advantage of your trauma and weaknesses and erode Desire.

ID=46003030
If that happens, it will be a matter of time before your figure of "old days" going crazy with Desire Energy will appear.

ID=46003031
Desire ...? What is that story Tenebus.\n%username% can not have Desire Energy.

ID=46003032
Is%username% originally a soul worker?\nSince Seoul Energy and Desire Energy can not coexist, no matter how much erosion is done ...

ID=46003033
Oh yeah ... others believed that you were a soul worker.

ID=46003034
Hmm ...? What on earth is that?

ID=46003035
please do not worry.\nThis is something that%username% needs to say directly, not me.

ID=46003036
... I do not want to say much, though.

ID=46003037
Then let's ask.

ID=46003038
%username%.\nCan you be sure that you can fight with Amaryllis without losing yourself until the very end?

ID=36003001
This is not a question of whether you are physically strong or not strong.\nBecause you will be totally shadowed if the spirit collapses even a little.

ID=36003002
Here you go.

ID=16123001
As I lose myself, it is useless worry.\nJust like usually ... you only have to enjoy the battle.

ID=16123002
... Do you really think that it is such a simple task?

ID=16123003
I know that there is something dirtying my feelings in front of me.\nBut even if so, everything is an illusion after all. It should end in a place to defile my feelings.

ID=16123004
The child did not really come back to life,\nThere is no need to be swayed by a cheesy vision just made.

ID=16123005
... It's brute, clearly.

ID=16123006
It is not the act of others to decide whether it is brute or not,\nIs not it my own action?

ID=16123007
Believe confidence without such grounds and let go of%username% ...!

ID=16123008
Well, give up.\nEven if you are worrying like that, I do not think I will ask%username%.

ID=16123009
I do not have the power to prevent%username% from going anyway?

ID=16123010
It is obvious that you are going to be in danger but you have to let go.\nI feel sorry for myself who can not do anything like this.

ID=16123011
This may lead to global crisis ...\nThe spirit of%username% may be contaminated ...

ID=16123012
Giving up here is exactly the same, disobeying the threat of the world.\nWhatever you make any choice, if you are the same, choose who you do not run away.

ID=16123013
... It seems that determination does not shake by any means.

ID=16123014
understood.\nWhat I can do is about to pray.

ID=16123015
Surely it will be fine.\nTenebris has too much underestimated%username%.

ID=56123001
Whatever you say, I will go.\nBecause I can not see the wildest appearance of that child.

ID=56123002
......

ID=26123001
... Thank you.

ID=46123001
You are ... a rude person in Grace City.\nFor what purpose did it appear before me?

ID=46123002
Hahaha, you are as nervous as ever.\n%username% met Amaryllis and was waiting for the real figure to wake up.

ID=46123003
A true figure? You talk strange.\nI have never showed you a figure that seems pointless even once.

ID=46123004
No, that is not the meaning, it is a celebration for you taking away your body. my mother.

ID=46123005
Although it seems that it took longer than expected, I would like to congratulate you from the heart that I regained the body.\nIt was a bit of a hard time to materialize you who was only desire, but there are rewarding things.

ID=46123006
When I got out of the blanks and lost my memory, when I became completely strangely it was serious and rough!\nHahaha, I was giving up when I saw a figure that flew away as saving boring humans.

ID=46123007
If it was not even the woman I guess it was going well more ...\nWhat is it supposed to be because I am not late now?

ID=46123008
Now, I will go.\nI am preparing everything for you to go crazy.

ID=46123009
Why are you suddenly saying anything suspicious?\nNow, I'd like to hear more talk before dropping my neck.

ID=46123010
What's wrong? Maybe because I have not seen you for a long time, do not you get used to it?\nIf I do not know without trying to move, I will prepare the meat dolls ...

ID=46123011
If you send a bit of information to a foolish Star Forest it will do as usual, hahaha!

ID=46123012
......

ID=46123013
Mashita ... Is not it deserial side?

ID=46123014
Desire side ... No way!

ID=46123015
......

ID=46123016
Haha! How! I did not decently check, I talked to my old friend in a mood.\nI am very happy because it is a fighting friend who stamped humans with fun together in the blank ...

ID=46123017
Mistake mistake, do not mind!\nI do not see the extra like me like a complete black curtain! Hahaha!

ID=46123018
Hahaha! I have been touched!\nThis is totally unexpected!

ID=46123019
Can you stop talking and talk to me as it is?\nYou will see the blade on your neck.

ID=46123020
Haha ... yes! say! I will say anything!

ID=46123021
That "shadow" is the soul spirit itself of Desire Energy.\nEspecially, the mass of desire of%username% was excellent among the many works I have seen.

ID=46123022
Even though I touched your desire a little, it exploded beautifully.\nDesire calls even greater desire. That is why it expands endlessly.

ID=46123023
So it is a providence that 'Shadow' designer is much stronger than weak emotional power like you.\nNo matter who whatever it is, the true desire is a complete body that eroded and dominated human soul energy.

ID=46123024
That's why I listen seriously ...

ID=46123025
Everything ... Why did you like dolls beyond "shadows\

ID=46123026
......

ID=46123027
Kufu ... ... haha!

ID=46123028
Well, that does not matter.\nThe prepared plan may be distorted somewhat, but it has not ended completely.

ID=46123029
Apparently the work seems to increase.\nAnything planned carefully to pull in%username% has all been wasted.

ID=46123030
Rather than waste ... It seems that it has become considerably troublesome.\nWell, let 's give the win to you guys this time only.

ID=46123031
Let's meet again.\nWhere ... I do not know how it will meet.

ID=36123001
Sufficiency, now, it will be dead soon ... ... Oh! What?

ID=36123002
... It will not disappear.\nIt sounds like a rogue thoroughly.

ID=66133001
I came back,%username%!\nHahaha! This time also fought well!

ID=66133002
Do not close the mouth of the legendary soul worker who was doing a good arms work with this arm!\nOh, it seems just to come, so let's ask! What's wrong?

ID=66133003
As you guys,%username% has been growing forever.\nYou should not have to say that you should go home even if you still have a little anxiety.

ID=66133004
Ha ha ha! What is it! Now say something about%username%!

ID=66133005
I will not hold back.\nBesides that, although it is urgent, we will have time to rest.

ID=66133006
Hmm ...? What errands are you, suddenly ...

ID=66133007
I got a choreographed thing to check quickly.\nBecause I have done what I should do, I will not say I'm no good, right?

ID=66133008
Oh ... now I can also study the fantasy space.\nThere is no urgent business for the time being. Take care.

ID=66133009
... Did you find anything strange?

ID=66133010
As you did for me, I will not say until I can be sure.\nPlease wait with patience. Like I did.

ID=66133011
There seems to be something wrong ... I understand. I am waiting for it.

ID=15904001
There will be nothing I do not know.\nDo whatever, remember!

ID=15904002
I do not even know. I seem to have completely fainted ... I'm sorry!

ID=15904003
Do not you have to apologize, so do you not even remember something alone?\nReally, can not you remember all from the beginning?

ID=15904004
Oh ... desperate to survive ...

ID=15904005
Better ... ... is Near Soul Worker?\nWhere are they now?

ID=15904006
do not know. Even if I keep tracking if I understand it.\nSo how's Sarah sighing?

ID=15904007
Do not ask me.\nIt is serious that an accident happens all over the world now.

ID=15904008
...? Is there another problem occurring?

ID=15904009
After the woman of Zion and gold armor disappeared, abnormal phenomena occurred suddenly throughout Crow Dream.\nPerhaps, it's a bad situation.

ID=15904010
Is that ... right?\nIt is because of us ... not it?

ID=15904011
We just followed the order of the upper part.\n... But there is plenty of possibility to bear the responsibility.

ID=15904012
Haha ... I'm used to being touched with responsibility.\nIn the worst case, I will tell the members of the research team not to discipline.\nAlthough accusations are inevitable, they will not lose their workplace.

ID=15904013
It will be saved ... It will be a big problem if you lose the laboratory.

ID=15904014
Is there anything I can do for you?\n... I can not do anything and I can not get miserable.

ID=15904015
In place of me I want to lower my head in front of a great man ... I want to say,\nTo ask such a thing for Seoul workers is a waste of talented talent.

ID=15904016
Dig Digs who ramped up to raise Zion also completely stopped functioning,\nThe reaction of a mysterious woman who appeared suddenly disappeared with the near soul worker.

ID=15904017
Unlike other areas, this place is quiet as never as before and no problems have arisen.\nIn this situation it is said that we are asking%username% from ....

ID=15904018
Kugu ... Then that one ... even those one ...!

ID=15904019
Do not say unreasonable. How am I going to find it alone?

ID=15904020
Still it is much better than not doing anything!

ID=15904021
No, it is correct not to do anything.\nThe reaction of the near soul worker has completely disappeared in the Ruin Fortress.\nTracking is impossible.

ID=15904022
But ...!

ID=15904023
%username%, I am not worried about that girls.\n... But will you go to Amanda right now?

ID=15904024
I was running around here with a rough appearance from a little while ago.\nPerhaps it got something important. Go and ask.

ID=55904001
... all right.\nNow it seems better to start with work I can.

ID=55904002
Thank you for understanding.\nRight now I do not think I will take responsibility alone, and I will let you call out from the work I can do.

ID=25904001
Please go to Dr. Sarah and Amanda. There may be some clues.

ID=65904001
Sorry ... I could not do anything and I came back.

ID=65904002
It's enough to just come back.\nBesides, I do not have anything qualified.

ID=65904003
You do not need to be sick if you care about Hicks.\nThe president of the part-time job also said that when the shelf of the product turned over, think about how to clear away quickly before compensation.

ID=65904004
Thinking about the future from what I finished ... Is it meaningful?

ID=65904005
Ah. I am also keenly aware of my inability to bring a near soul worker back.\nStill, I can not give up without doing anything like this!

ID=65904006
Exactly ...\nI have to work harder too ...

ID=65904007
Okay, I will teach you what I understand now.\nI do not mind being asked for support requests from everywhere ...

ID=65904008
Any information is OK! Now I want clues at least.

ID=65904009
... The cause of the noise is abnormal.

ID=65904010
Since the reaction of Zion has disappeared, abnormal whites appearing all over the world are activating activities.\nThe reaction of the near soul worker who tried pursuit has also completely disappeared, and it is a pity, but I do not think they will let her get their hands anymore.

ID=65904011
Anomalous blank ... Martin gave up searching and had a reason for being annoyed.

ID=65904012
I do not think that he has such a deep idea ...\nIt is information I know suddenly that abnormal whites appeared around the world.

ID=65904013
Thank you very much. Well then, I will ask other people to talk.

ID=95904001
Did you hear the news that anomalous space appeared from Amanda?

ID=95904002
Oh, it seems that blanks have become activated ... It is the crisis of the whole world.

ID=95904003
Well, there are cases in the past that blanks are opened all at once,\nIt has been hardly active recently, but it was not rare a couple of years ago.

ID=95904004
Well, is that so? I wonder if it will become a world like a hell full of terrors ...

ID=95904005
Oh, you like hell better?

ID=95904006
No way! If the world became hell I was going to declare it would be a healer!

ID=95904007
I am prepared for it but I do not need to worry about that.\nThe Star Forest Alliance entered into an emergency regime, but should be able to control this level.

ID=95904008
But the nature of the blank confirmed this time is different.\nSo now, in the Star Forest Union we are investigating the blank by calling it "ideal blank".

ID=95904009
Is there something unusual as well?

ID=95904010
I can freely go in and out.

ID=95904011
Oh ... that is amazing beyond what I thought!

ID=95904012
Common blanks suck humans inside and there is no way to escape?\nAnd there are side effects that people who come out of the blanks lose their memory.

ID=95904013
That freely comes in and out of the anomalous empty spaces that have emerged this time.\nIt can be said that it is not a white hole and a black hole but a gate or a passage connecting here and a blank inside.

ID=95904014
Thanks to you, the Starry Forest Alliance is currently fussing inside.\nIt seems that we may be able to finish the disaster of 15 years this time, and organize a dedicated team to investigate abnormal blanks at once.

ID=95904015
Perhaps Near soul workers are there ...!

ID=95904016
I am not sure, but probably not.\nThere is no report that abnormal whites occurred around here, so it will not be sucked in.

ID=95904017
That's too bad ...

ID=95904018
What are you going to do?\nAre you going to search for the near soul worker who disappeared here for a long time, or are going to investigate abnormal empty space?

ID=95904019
... Sarah said there was no near soul worker there,\nI can not think of any other places there.

ID=95904020
You do not mean to stay here. I'm sorry.

ID=95904021
I often told you%username%!\nNow that the response of the near soul worker has disappeared, it is more efficient to search with the blank.

ID=95904022
Is not it only because I do not want to go in the blank by myself?\nAccording to what I heard, it seems that he was selected as a survey team of abnormal blank spaces this time.

ID=95904023
Hahaha, you guessed.\nWould you mind staying blank together?

ID=95904024
Of course it looks interesting, but I'm interested in the energy hidden here.\nBesides, unlike Amanda, you are incompetent.

ID=95904025
all right. It is impossible to forcibly take the ordinary people who do not want to go to drift.

ID=95904026
Let us suppose that we will go to work.\nIt seems that abnormal blank space is near Rocotown, so it is confluent on site.

ID=45904001
Oh,%username%! Long time no see, eh!

ID=45904002
Mi ... Miriam ...! I 'm happy ...

ID=45904003
The place where we are not good at talking to women is the same.

ID=35904001
Hah ... That does not change so easily ...

ID=35904002
Certainly, that's right.

ID=15914001
Anyway, it was just right timing. It is a big fuss during Locotown due to the recently generated blank.

ID=15914002
Can you see that blank floating in the sky of Locotown?\nIt is an order of magnitude larger than neighboring blanks.

ID=15914003
It is the place where I am falling.

ID=15914004
Recently, the phenomenal blanks have just started to revitalize suddenly.\nNot only that, it seems possible to enter and leave freely according to the research team's report.

ID=15914005
Thanks to everyone in Rocotown evacuating urgently ...\nOn the contrary, E.S. P, a fortified person unit of the Star Forest Alliance, is gathered at Locotown.

ID=15914006
E.S.P ...?

ID=15914007
Actually, I'm not sure.\nI wonder if it is an abbreviation of "EsperStrikeProcess" and I think that it is a group of people with different powers.

ID=15914008
While the Stari Forest Alliance 's experts usually play an active part in various places,\nIt gathers only at the time of a truly important mission.\nIt seems to be called "process" with the meaning of a temporary system, not a team or organization.\n... That gathering means that this time it's so important.

ID=15914009
In short, the strong people gather!\nI hope there are many good people!

ID=15914010
There are basically many good people in different powers, so do not worry!\nWill it be more empty than that? Are not you afraid?

ID=55914001
To be honest, I am a little anxious ...\n... But that does not mean I can not withdraw!

ID=55914002
It is nice to have motivation, but you do not need to push yourself.\nSometimes the back of%username% looks uneasy ... I hope you care.

ID=55914003
I will try it.\n... but I do not feel confident as long as there are people to protect in front of me.

ID=55914004
I see ...\nWell then shall we ask you not to die?

ID=55914005
Of course, do not worry because I am not going to die!\nI will surely save lots of people and come back!

ID=55914006
Yeah ... do not push too much.

ID=25914001
I will follow you as soon as preparation is completed. Do not push yourself too much, do you? What?

ID=65914001
You came, I'm glad.

ID=65914002
Oh! I'm arriving overtaking me who came running fast! Well, tough training! What?

ID=65914003
No, I just used a bit of the byproduct of the modern civilization called helicopter.\nIt seems to be an absurd privilege, but it is necessary to go back and forth between Ruin Fortress and work here. Will not you forgive me?

ID=65914004
Rather it is better to run directly and train the body, so I will not mind doing that! Hahaha!

ID=65914005
That boldness that laughs off irrationality positively.\nNever think of belonging to the Starry Forest Alliance? You can use it like a cloth and you will be thrown away.

ID=65914006
Hahaha! If it comes to helping someone, I will even become clothes!

ID=65914007
Haha ... even black jokes will not be blown away with a smile like the sun.

ID=65914008
I will tell this story of the adult world to this place, it will be about to come to the point.

ID=65914009
Oh, I beg you!

ID=65914010
... I am just coming now, it is reality that we have not been able to conduct a decent survey yet.

ID=65914011
As you can see, only the initial team responsible for the rush arrives.\nBoth are also for Fortune troops in Locotown and soul workers in Grace City\nI will support you, but now it's like this.

ID=65914012
Candas city is? Sure, I think there was a unit trained in practice.

ID=65914013
If Candas' Force Strike unit, it was refused support request.\nIt seems that even repeating excuses of Seoul Junk's elimination even even orders of the general rank class.

ID=65914014
Well, it was a soldier unit after the Amaryllis incident, it would be useless.\nI guess I will only have the support of the Force Strike Forces stationed in other cities.

ID=65914015
... I have to go help one more time someday.

ID=65914016
No, think carefully.\nIf you analyze this space and exit from the original, soul junk will never come out any more.\nNow if you concentrate only on here, you can solve other problems on your own.

ID=65914017
Oh, that's right! It's burning ...!

ID=65914018
The Star Forest Association believes that the incident on this abnormal space is the end point of all disasters.\nIt is a pity that Ned Company betrayed at such a time.

ID=65914019
Such guys are better not to have it.

ID=65914020
Even if it is a relationship connected by money, it can not be denied that it was one of the main forces that the Star Forest Alliance relied on.\nI think that it is necessary to look at important things more important than this time at the time like this ... the timing of betrayal is too bad.

ID=65914021
Well, it can not be helped.\nLet's concentrate on supplementing our strength while proceeding with this investigation for the moment.

ID=65914022
I will continue to manage the survey team in Ruin Fortress, so I will come and go both places.\nInformation on near soul workers will be reported to%username% as soon as it can be confirmed. Oh, in the upper part, it is confidential.

ID=65914023
Of course I will keep it secret! Thank you!

ID=65914024
Well, will%username% go to Amanda?\nSince I was just in the blank, leave me a greeting.

ID=95914001
Huh

ID=95914002
Oh ... Hello Amanda.\nShe seems to be very tired.

ID=95914003
No ... I just curse my destiny.

ID=95914005
I think humans are consumables.\nI am measuring the limits of my patience.

ID=95914006
Oh ... if there is anything I can do it will not work!\nAfter a bad thing, surely good things are waiting!

ID=95914007
By doing that, you are always positive.\nI did not say it before the people who fight on the scene at the work place, sorry.

ID=95914009
The rest after working and sweating is exceptional!\nLet's do more hard!

ID=95914010
... Perhaps it is best to think like%username% now.

ID=95914011
of course! Positive thoughts will train your body and mind!\n... Ah! It does not mean that that is is not beautiful! Excuse me when I care.

ID=95914012
Hehuu, why do not you talk to someone standing alone there with that momentum?

ID=95914013
According to what I heard, it seems to be Tenebris, a legendary soul worker that appeared suddenly ten years ago and bounced back the strength of Vesi.

ID=95914014
Oh! Did you accomplish something amazing? He is likely to be a model for the same soul worker!

ID=95914015
Oh, you do not know. Suddenly appeared ten years ago,\nHe guided the soul workers and the disabled people and won the victory many times in the war with Vesi.

ID=95914016
Thanks to that, human beings could push back Vesi and enjoy prosperity.\nBut, doing something unreasonable five years ago ... No, you do not have to worry so far.

ID=95914017
Anyhow, hero who was known regardless of age and sex in this world.\nThe end was not very nice, but it is famous enough to always come out with children's hero's cheeks.

ID=95914018
That ... that person who is such awesome!

ID=95914019
I am expecting it, but it is probably a different person or a fake person of the same name.

ID=95914020
... Really. It is not a ghost to say it is dead, it can not stay here ... ...

ID=95914021
The name "Teneburis" was very popular back then and there are things I used cat licks.\nProbably, I think that kind.

ID=95914022
And Tenebris, then, I saw directly with this eye, was not that young.\nA bit more ... It was feeling old.

ID=95914023
Then I will investigate directly!\nA villain trying to use the fame of others can not forgive!

ID=95914024
There is also the possibility of the same name simply, so do not doubt from the beginning?

ID=45914001
Hello! I am%username%!

ID=45914002
......

ID=45914003
It seems that Tenebrus is a name.\nIs it OK if you are not rude to see if you are the principal?

ID=45914004
%username% ...\n... The story that he came into the blank was not a lie, did he?

ID=45914005
Hmm ...? What is that story?

ID=45914006
Yes ... you lost your memory.\nIt seems that she has been panicked. Although it is painful ... I will start with self-introduction.

ID=35914001
My name is Teneburis.\nLong ago, I fought in the blank with you ... It is irreplaceable battlefield.

ID=15924001
Fighting friend ...? I'm sorry but I do not have such a memory at all ...

ID=15924002
Haha, it seems useless because the people who were kicked out of the blanks seem to forget what was here.\nWould you please listen to me as it is?

ID=15924003
%username% taught me to always think straight at any time, absolutely not give in any circumstances.\nAt first I thought that I did not think about anything, but from the time I was able to gain power with the will power of%username%.

ID=15924004
If you were not here I am not ...%username%.

ID=15924005
I do not really understand what you are talking about ...\nI am honored if it helps ... haha ​​...

ID=15924006
If I were not like this, I would have to offer a trip again, it is a pity.

ID=15924007
Also answer my question!\nIf you are truly Tenebris, what happened to Tenebris who died in reality?

ID=15924008
Oh, that's right ... My body went out over there, it died ...

ID=15924009
What a body ... is you in front of you Is not it altogether?

ID=15924010
It may be a bit different if we say alter ego.

ID=15924011
Does user%% know the existence of soul spirit in the human body?\nIt is a phenomenon that the will of a person separates from the body, but in many cases it is common for children to appear.

ID=15924012
There, there are! It is a child who gave me power.

ID=15924013
It will be easy to understand if you have seen it.\nI became that soul spirit you know, it is a thing separated from the main body.

ID=15924014
In other words, are you talking about the soul spirit of Tenebris that died in reality ...?\nIt's complicated ...

ID=15924015
It seems that the mind that I thought "I would like to remain in the space" embodied on the day when I was kicked out of the blank.\nIt is common in the blanks.

ID=15924016
In summary, the will of Tenebris' s willingness to remain blank makes Seoul Spirit,\nDid Tenebris return to reality died in the war?

ID=15924017
Yes ... and I became in a state where I can not leave far away from the entity over there,\nI was tied up here at the closest point of the empty whirlwind.

ID=15924018
My story ... will you believe me?

ID=55924001
Of course I believe!

ID=55924002
As expected,%username% I know is no better.\nI trust people without grounds or reasons.

ID=55924003
If you just trust people like that, you probably forgot all that advised you someday to see painful eyes?

ID=55924004
I do not mind! Try to believe it for the time being, if I have a problem do I manage to do something!

ID=55924005
That word is exactly the same.\nHe seemed to have returned as usual.

ID=55924006
If there was only one change ...\nI wonder at that time that it was a mediocre competent who is not a soul worker.

ID=55924007
I do not know the story after I parted with%username% because I became such a body.\n... Were you able to become a soul worker too?

ID=55924008
If the story of the soul worker awake ...\nI asked for the soul spirit, after that I wanted to coalesce with that girl ...!

ID=55924009
Seoul Spirit will appear after becoming a soul worker.\nIt is contradictory to wake up seeking that soul spirit.

ID=55924010
Mu ... well you do not understand.\nWhen I opened my eyes for the first time in the ruins ... In the moment when the enemy appeared the weapon suddenly appeared ...

ID=55924011
Then it seems that it was already a soul worker at that time.\nIt will not be awakened by such a trivial incident.

ID=55924012
Well, such a thing is OK!\nIf I could help people with this power, that would be satisfying!

ID=55924013
Yes ... If you are a strong sense of justice, you probably woke up to soul workers alone.\n... I think so, too.

ID=55924014
Still it can not wipe anxiety as long as the possibility still remains a little ...\nMr.%username% ... Are you sure to show me your activity again here?

ID=55924015
my mother! I do not know what worries so much, but of course I am OK!\nDo not get nervous when you think you can see legends ...!

ID=55924016
So thank you very much for your continued support.

ID=25924001
... I suppose I will never meet again.

ID=65924001
Oh, you came to a nice place. We were about to finish the surrounding reconnaissance and we were about to organize a search group of places where we stepped on a little.

ID=65924002
I've been waiting! I will go with you as well!

ID=65924003
I hope I find people sucked in this survey.\nEveryone who entered the blank is exceptionally powerful, so if you take them back, the war with Vesi ... I am looking forward to imagination alone.

ID=65924004
Ah! Even now it should be somewhere awaiting rescue!\nDo not remember the faces of people waiting for the rescue seen by Life Saver bytes many times ...

ID=65924005
Haha, I would rather than have people who rescue now rather than.\nI tried communicating in all directions with Amanda 's ability, but I did not get any income.

ID=65924006
Those in danger are determined to have no means of communication!\nI learned when I was in the fire department with a part of a mountain rescue team!

ID=65924007
...%username% ... Why are you doing soul workers instead of superman?

ID=65924008
I ... did you say something?

ID=65924009
No, it is a soliloquy.

ID=65924010
Oops, I did not want to talk like this. Currently, our biggest mission is organizing the surroundings.\nSince it is a blank space unknown what will happen, we need to secure safety before other troops come in sequentially.

ID=65924011
Even if it is a flying summer insect,\nSpeaking of great people, they must do it.

ID=65924012
Summer insects are okay!\nAll the danger I will show off!

ID=45924001
Search, cheers for good work.

ID=35924001
This ... it was quite annoying.\nNo way, the remnants of Rapid Flame of Grace City will appear to such a place.

ID=15934001
No matter how much it appears! I will eliminate all things that pose a human threat!

ID=15934002
The trouble to come up to the blanket and fight first is Vesi ... honestly beat fast.

ID=15934003
Like whitespace in the sky of a human city, there is exactly the same blank space in the area of ​​Vesi?

ID=15934004
Rather it is easy to fight and it will be saved!\nI have fought many times over from him!

ID=15934005
However, I do not mind why they are united in this place without anything.\nIf you are Tenebrus who has lived here for a long time, you know a little about this situation. Why do not you ask a little?

ID=55934001
Yes! In addition, my activity must also appeal!

ID=55934002
%username% is a big fan of Tenebris.\nCan I trust that person who does not know the purpose yet so much?

ID=55934003
My eyes to see my men who experienced a phone sales byte is certain!\nTenebris is not lying. It seems there is circumstance, but you better understand it gradually!

ID=55934004
Why can you train eyes to see people on phone sales ...

ID=55934005
Whoever trusts is a nice thing about%username%, but trusting too blindly is not good.\nIf you search for information inside the Star Forest Alliance or ask for money, please report it to me as a spy.

ID=55934006
my mother! Thank you for worrying about me!\nWell then, I will go to ask Tenebris soon!

ID=25934001
Let's hear the story with legend.

ID=65934001
I'm home! Everyone evil wicked Vesi!

ID=65934002
I came back, thanks for your hard work.\nNo way that it will fight with Vesi.

ID=65934003
What does that mean?\nVesi is a human enemy! The object of purging at any time! ... Well, is not it?

ID=65934004
It may be so out of the blank which began war with Vesi.\nHowever, here the human and Vesi had little interference.

ID=65934005
Is that ... right? I only thought it was an enemy ...

ID=65934006
Because there is a common enemy called Soul Junk that is infinitely generated in the blank\nWe avoided useless exhaustion of each other.

ID=65934007
First of all, it is strange that Vesi is stationed in such a place.\nBecause the area around this area is an area where supplies were exhausted and abandoned long ago ...

ID=65934008
But it is true that Vesi attacked first ...

ID=65934009
Surely ... it is weird ...

ID=65934010
I do not know if it is strange, but if I attack, I have to fight back.\nI will fight for the sake of you forever! So, please be watching Tenebris!

ID=65934011
Yes ... as I said, let's keep watching a little more now.\nIn order to figure out what you really can do as a soul worker ...

ID=65934012
Oh, I remembered "Anxiety" I mentioned before was solved?\nI fought a lot for Mr. Tenebris!

ID=65934013
No ... I can not prove anything simply by being enthusiastic.\nYou have to look carefully over time, so you do not need to hurry.

ID=65934014
But, unlike him I know,%username% is still a man full of strong will and power.\nIt must have surpassed many hardships and trials so far.

ID=65934015
Hahaha! Compared to the legendary soul worker, it is still too much!\nFrom now on, I will devote more!

ID=65934016
......

ID=95934001
Well ... good ... ... Welcome back%username%.\nAs you can see, he is moving his heavy boxes now hard. Can I borrow justice and power of soul workers?

ID=95934002
Where is the rest of the box! What?\nI will show you my competence called biped walking forklift with a byte at the logistics center! !

ID=95934003
... No, I just said that ...\nYou can not leave such a chore to%username% fighting in the blank.

ID=95934004
Besides, anyway%username% has some of this to take.\nI have to have it installed for the surveillance search.

ID=95934005
Oh! It was not a machine to look for a man! What?

ID=95934006
It is a spirit path finder supported from Heavy Gears of Grace City.\nIt is planned to detect and search the flow of Seoul Energy of survivors.

ID=95934007
Every survivor in the blank is a different person, so even if it is in a distant place, it is clearly perceived.\n... and it seems that great masters think.

ID=95934008
In the opinion of Dr. Sarah, if there are so many blanks to discharge so many workers and soul workers,\nIt seems that Seoul Energy is certainly infesting everywhere.

ID=95934009
It is not a problem that there is no reaction, it seems that there is too much reaction and it can not be distinguished which is which.\nEven though I know all that, I carry this heavy machinery.\nBecause it is a command of a great san ... hahaha.

ID=95934010
Still, should not I do better than not do anything?\nRegret is not late even after setting up!

ID=95934011
After all the soldiers and others were used in this case, when it became meaningless totally,\nIt is me who speak ill of others behind the scenes. Hahaha ...

ID=95934012
Good ... ... ... ah, already, shoulder ...! Why did I do this ...

ID=95934013
Amanda was working too?

ID=95934014
Epson staff members were under patrol and were left out because there were few staff members left in the garrison.\nIt is not dangerous for the Star Forest Association to fail to work properly without the help of such a weak woman.

ID=95934015
It is weak ... Pupu!

ID=95934016
Apparently, I guess I have to beat someone there.\nBecause I do not want to show much to you, will you close your eyes a bit?

ID=95934017
I'm sorry, Mr. Martin ... to stop doing women's ... ...

ID=95934018
wait a minute! Laughing with a story that it is so small ...!\nAh! painful! Do not beat me! Wow, this is lower!

ID=95934019
Well ... it's a lot of serious people working seriously.

ID=95934020
I know that Amanda is different from the old one!\nIf you put in more spirit, surely other people will admit it!

ID=95934021
... I have to work harder to make up for any incorrect judgment at Ruin.

ID=95934022
Let's forget about what you have done and concentrate on what will happen in the future!\nI am doing that as well! Hahaha!

ID=95934023
Huh ... ... When speaking with%username%, it seems that somehow I will be affected ...\nI will work harder, so please install Spirit Pathfinder.

ID=45934001
Hahaha, I got a lot of effort.\nI ended up losing everything after all.

ID=45934002
House! At least it became my strength training training!

ID=45934003
Hahaha, that's a positive personality, as long as it's enviable.

ID=35934001
Well, it was within the forecast that the Spirit Pathfinder could not be used\n... It is different from what I expected.

ID=35934002
Yes! Please explain!

ID=15944001
Spirit Pathfinder can not sense Seoul Energy at all.\nIncluding%username% and other energy from other people, all.

ID=15944002
It is contrary to the expectation that Seoul Energy is overflowing and can not be detected.\nSo I'm investigating the cause of a simple machine failure.

ID=15944003
Leave it to me who was doing a watch repair byte if it is machine related!\nYou can repair as much as you need with tools and drawings and spare parts!

ID=15944004
It's a brand new item that was newly introduced for blank search, so it can not be broken ...

ID=15944005
Oh, can you go to Amanda once more than that?\nI was looking for%username% earlier with a serious face.

ID=15944006
Serious face ... Maybe you are in danger!

ID=15944007
Surely, it is probably that such things as having laundered too much to dry up, or forgetting to close the main hopper of the stove.\nLooking for%username% is a washing line thick.

ID=55944001
Haha, I see. I did not think that taking a qualification as a cleaningist would be useful at such times.\nI will go and help you soon!

ID=55944002
%username%, who are you really ....

ID=25944001
Take care. I will see you off here.

ID=65944001
Ah. %username%, I came!\nI'm busy but I'm sorry for calling you one time.

ID=65944002
Leave it to both hands until washing, rinsing, and dehydration! Where are the laundry!

ID=65944003
What ... what are you talking about? You can not call it with such a thing!

ID=65944004
Hmm ...?, Martin said that she was calling for laundry indeed ...

ID=65944005
It seems necessary to physically destroy the stereotype for me.

ID=65944006
Anyway, what I called is ... a strange voice was heard.

ID=65944007
There were times when "laughing" or "came" and sometimes laughing awkward laughter.\nIt seems that it sounds close to%username%, but noise like a tinnitus is also occurring together and it's quite handy to analyze the content.

ID=65944008
No way, is it a ghost? OK, I'll hit you all and catch it!

ID=65944009
It is a place I want to say that it is not a ghost to flowing though ...\nI do not know anything yet.

ID=65944010
If you do not recognize%username%, you can only do it with caution as soon as possible.\n... I do not know what I can do even if I take care.

ID=95944001
It was a pleasure. How was the strategy?

ID=95944002
No, it seems that there was a problem with the machine or not working at all.

ID=95944003
I see ... I saw many people struggling, but it is disappointing.\nWhat on earth was that machine?

ID=95944004
It seems that nothing was perceived though it was a machine that sensued Energy.\nLooking at the place where my soul energy can not be sensed, it will not be wrong with a breakdown.

ID=95944005
To%username% ... Is not that wrong?

ID=95944006
Oh! I heard that it was not perceived at all!

ID=95944007
......

ID=95944008
... You do not have to think seriously so far! If you are a survivor, I will search with these feet!

ID=95944009
Yes ... I thought that%username% would say so.\nUm ... Can I check only one last?

ID=95944010
Ask me whatever you can answer me!

ID=95944011
......

ID=95944012
you are ...\nIs it really a soul worker?

ID=95944013
Huh ...? What does that mean ...

ID=95944014
Oh, I was here. I looked for%username%.\nCan I have some time?

ID=95944015
Um ... Tenebris?

ID=95944016
I'm sorry. Please forget the word you said earlier.

ID=95944017
......

ID=95944018
How was the story with Amanda? As I said it was not a permanent business?

ID=95944019
Ah ... I heard you heard a ghostly voice.\nIt seems that he did not hear well ...

ID=95944020
ghost ....

ID=95944021
Oh, do you know something?\nI thought that it is a legendary Tenebris who lives in the blank after all!\nCome on, tell me!

ID=95944022
No ... I will not get it confused at important times, either.\nI will tell you more from watching the situation ...

ID=95944023
Is anything but a luxury to tell me?

ID=95944024
It is for%username% san ... Please understand.

ID=95944025
Fu ... There are various things I want to say, but now it was not such a case.\n%username%, I got a job.

ID=95944026
Since the machine is useless, the E.S.P unit directly inspected and investigated,\nI identified the places where they gathered well.\nThere seems to be a machine that collects energy, Flame Tempest.

ID=95944027
Collect energy ... Can you do such a thing with Vesi who is outside?

ID=95944028
No, this is a machine made by a human who cooperated with Vesi.\nRapid Flame was positively using at Grace City.

ID=95944029
Machine to rupture humans and collect soul energy ...\nWhy are you in such a place?

ID=95944030
Perhaps, when Vesi was sucked in, she probably came in with me.\n... Maybe there is the possibility that all the people left here are also sacrificed.

ID=95944031
all right. It is obvious that it becomes a threat to people.\nI will break it as soon as I go!

ID=95944032
After all,%username% is always passionate.

ID=95944033
......

ID=95944034
What happened ... Tenebris.\nDo such a serious look.

ID=95944035
No ... nothing.

ID=45944001
It was truly a big success!\nThanks to ensuring minimum safety with active use of%username% this time\nYou finally got to call Fortune troops.

ID=45944002
Thanks to you, you said that you injured and cowards trying to escape from the blank\nIt has become possible to stop it.\nFloof ... ...%username% everyone.

ID=35944001
I feel like I've done something terribly bad ...

ID=35944002
Ha ha ha, did you understand now?

ID=15954001
It seems that Miriam is coming at the dispatch of Fortune troops.\nIt seemed to be busy in assembling a medical tent, how about going to see him?

ID=55954001
Oh! By the way, Mr. Miriam came over here!\nI have to stick straight and say hello!

ID=55954002
Well, if you go get together, I will ask for an introduction.\nBe particularly appealing to the point that you are still single.

ID=55954003
Eh, oh ... yes ...

ID=25954001
You'd better go see Miriam.

ID=65954001
Oh,%username%!\nI am sorry, was it a bit late, is not it? It takes more time to prepare than I thought ...

ID=65954002
I'm happy ... Miriam!\nSorry I can not help assembling the tent!

ID=65954003
Assembling a tent is our job, so you do not have to worry.\nMore than that, I would be happy if you let me know about the situation here.\nI have been preparing at Loco Town for a long time and I do not understand anything.

ID=65954004
The group of Rapid Flame who worked wrongly in Grace City\nI processed it and there has not been any other change.

ID=65954005
Were you in Grace City? You are coming to such a place ...

ID=65954006
About people sucked in? I heard that one person has not been helped yet though ...

ID=65954007
... Sorry.\nNot enough of my power, no one has been found yet.

ID=65954008
No ... That's not something to apologize ...?\nI hope to continue working hard in the future. Yup!

ID=65954009
Then, after all, you do not know anything in the blank ...\nAt best it is about that there is this unreal place.

ID=65954010
Oh, there were other clues to mention blank!\nA person named Tenebris is ...

ID=65954011
Te ... Teneburi ...! ?!

ID=65954012
I ... do you know each other?

ID=65954013
Oh, he, well ... I was surprised because it was the name of a man called a legendary soul worker!\nWow amazing awesome ~ ...

ID=65954014
The surprising way is overruled ...

ID=65954015
Surely, how about then? What did the person talk about?

ID=65954016
I heard that I am a acquaintance from a long time ago.\nOther than that I have not heard anything to tell you, but would I ask if I have something else I would like to know?

ID=65954017
No, no ... no problem.\nIt is not special knowing, and I will go to see him if I have business if ... ...

ID=65954018
Oh, sorry,%username%! I have talked too much about building the camp yet!\nThe talk is here! Will you come back later?

ID=65954019
that. It was said that all the time ago ...

ID=65954020
see you soon! See you next time!

ID=65954021
Yes ... Later also.

ID=95954001
Thank you for your hard work,%username%.\nYou did it successfully. It is fluffy.

ID=95954002
Ah! If Tenebris admits it, I will get better!

ID=95954003
But ... there are still some uneasy points left.

ID=95954004
How did you become a soul worker ...\nIf you can not remember, do not you understand even a small clue?

ID=95954005
I also want to remember for Mr. Tenebris ...

ID=95954006
No ... There is no need to push yourself to remember.

ID=95954007
If%username% san, surely ... yeah.\nIf you are my brave friend,%username% ...\nIt should be proudly awakened as a soul worker.

ID=95954008
......

ID=95954009
I believe ... some anxiety will remain, but this anxiety is obviously due to other causes.\nAnd%username% said that it was my mistake\nI will surely prove it.

ID=95954010
You do not have to try to believe what you do not think.

ID=95954011
...... Excuse me.\nI will watch you quietly a little more.

ID=95954012
In that case I will work much more and I will have to clear up that anxiety!

ID=95954013
thank you very much.\nAfter all, you are very reliable.

ID=45954001
It seems that he was talking with the legendary soul worker,\nDid something happen?

ID=45954002
Disagreeable! There is nothing to report in particular!\nWell, let's get down to the next job!

ID=35954001
Oh! It is quite motivating!\nThen I will ask for your next job well!

ID=15964001
Rapid Flame was completely exterminated, but a place that could not be acquired also appeared.

ID=15964002
E.S.P unit has already abandoned the search because it is dangerous because you do not know what will come out.\nIf%username% is OK ...

ID=15964003
No, to be frank with you. I can not investigate unless it is%username%.\nPlease ask for my best regards.

ID=55964001
Leave it to me! I will be coming soon!

ID=55964002
It seems that it happened that we were visiting idols or suddenly moving to a strange place, or weird things.\nTake care enough and take the survey.

ID=25964001
I asked for your regard, research.

ID=45964001
came back ...

ID=45964002
What was your impression of fighting genuine ghosts?

ID=45964003
You ought to have done a byte of demonicist ... well ...

ID=35964001
But if you can hit and defeat a ghost, that's enough.\nYou can fight properly.

ID=15974001
No, not good. It is very dangerous to fight indiscriminately without knowing anything.\nHow about going asking Tenebris?

ID=15974002
But, too much relying too heavily on Tenebris ...

ID=15974003
There is no other person to depend on because there is no other one to depend on?\nIf I am afraid to go alone, I will go with you!

ID=55974001
No, I did not say that in that sense ... Oh, Martin!

ID=55974002
Would you care if you are busy and dying? Here we go!

ID=25974001
Now, I'm going to meet Tenebris!

ID=65974001
I am sorry many times have come, Tenebris Mr. ...

ID=65974002
No, I welcome you. Please come whenever you need my knowledge.

ID=65974003
Tenebris.\nIs there anything you can know about what%username% is experiencing?

ID=65974004
I can only answer that there is no information that can identify something.

ID=65974005
This is a place full of blanks, phenomena which can not be explained by common sense.\nBecause it is filled with Desire Energy, no matter what happens, there is nothing to be surprised about.

ID=65974006
Desire Energy ... ?! Are those words serious?

ID=65974007
Oh, did not you know?

ID=65974008
I do not know or nothing, how can I investigate the inaccessible blanks.

ID=65974009
I see ... I will have to explain from the nature of the blank.

ID=65974010
The blank is not a natural disaster nor a special space, it is a mass of enormous designer energy.\nOne big energy with the desire to "breathe everything".

ID=65974011
Therefore, in this area where we stand, Desire Energy is more familiar than air.

ID=65974012
I see ... was there reason why the Spirit Pathfinder that senses soul energy did not work?

ID=65974013
The reaction of Seoul Energy was drowned out by overwhelming Desire Energy and I could not sense anything.\nIt would have been noticed if Dr. Sarah was there, but anyway it is not when you need to say a human.

ID=65974014
No, wait ...?\nAmanda 's communication capability will be using Seoul Energy, so why can you use it?

ID=65974015
Soul Energy and Desire Energy should have had the property of extinguishing when they hit each other?

ID=65974016
......

ID=65974017
Well, if you say that,%username% can not use the power of soul worker,\nI should have said that it was good.

ID=65974018
For the time being, I will ask the person of the discrimination group investigating this energy to dispatch in the blank as promptly as possible.\nPlease wait while%username%.

ID=65974019
I was waiting ...! Is not it okay for me to move more like this?

ID=65974020
It is dangerous to move unnecessarily, as I understood that this is the base of Desire Energy.\nYou have to know in advance what the influence is at a minimum.

ID=65974021
Now, as work gets full - blown, I do not have time to rest, so let 's take a rest now.\nIs it because you need%username%, are you waiting now?

ID=65974022
... It can not be helped if I told you like that.

ID=65974023
By the way, Miriam seems to have been suffering from something before.\nWill you meet once and give me a consultation?

ID=65974024
I do not know if it will be useful ...\nIt is to decide after talking about it!

ID=95974001
How are you ... Miriam! I have heard that there is something to worry about!

ID=95974002
Oh, well ...

ID=95974003
There are really serious troubles ...

ID=95974004
Oh ... a little Well ... There is a personal trouble ...

ID=95974005
Although it may not be very useful, please bother me for Miriam!

ID=95974006
That ... that is not so serious! Just ... well ...

ID=95974007
I was talking with Tenebris earlier, did not he?\nDid not you talk something about Tenebris, me?

ID=95974008
No ... I never heard of it ...

ID=95974009
Uu ....

ID=95974010
Was it to be down to that! What?\nI thought that thought ... Miriam really is with Tenebris!

ID=95974011
Wrong! Is it wrong! ... Yup! Friend! My friends are suffering a bit!

ID=95974012
Oh! I was worrying about my friends! It seems Mr. Miriam!

ID=95974013
...... Yup.\nIf it is not a trouble ... Will you be troubled with me by listening to my friend's story?

ID=95974014
Um ... that's not my story though! Still it is better to have more troubles than myself ... is not it so?

ID=95974015
of course! Come on, tell me anything!

ID=95974016
Well, that's not my story, but my friends! There was a man who used to be friends ...\nBut that person may have lost his memory and may not remember anything ...

ID=95974017
It looks like a novel, but the real story ... ha ...

ID=95974018
It is truly a sad story to forget a lover in memory loss.

ID=95974019
Well, yeah ... really so ...

ID=95974020
By chance, he seems to have met a man who lost his memory ...\nBut I am afraid that a man does not remember himself.

ID=95974021
When you call out more than anything You may be hurt if anyone is to see your eyes ...\nTrue, I wonder what I should do ... I'm troubled ...

ID=95974022
Really ...\nI can understand their feelings.

ID=95974023
It may be strange to ask such a story to a man ...\n... What would you do?

ID=95974024
Mu ... The heart of a woman is difficult, so if you think I'm the man, please refer.

ID=95974025
First of all, there is no sense of refusal for a woman who speaks favorably even with an unknown person, and it will not absolutely disgust it!

ID=95974026
Ah ... really! What?

ID=95974027
Ah! Like my own thing about my friends, I guess it is Mr. Miriam!

ID=95974028
Ahahaha ... I am glad if my friend thinks that it will be pleased ~\nIs it really more annoying than that?

ID=95974029
If the world seems to be annoying to that extent, I can not even listen to people who do not know!\nYou should approach us normally and call your voice.

ID=95974030
Yeah ...\n... Approach and make a voice. This?

ID=95974031
Thank you. Thanks for that, I heard that it will take a bit of a decision.\nWell ... Of course not my friends!

ID=95974032
Miriam-san ... I suffer for this so much for my friends ...!

ID=95974033
So ...! I can not even be defeated!\nFor someone suffering here ... I will go fight!

ID=95974034
Yeah ... Thank you%username%! Come again!

ID=45974001
Is your vacation already OK?

ID=45974002
I can not lose to Miriam who works for my friends! Will not you work at once!

ID=45974003
I do not have any bad taste like calling me immediately after issuing a vacation order.\nI dislike most as one of the victims. That's it.

ID=45974004
When you have to take a day off, take a good rest.\nIf I have power, I intend to fight against the power of the darkness for the security of the rest of the soldiers.

ID=45974005
But I am really okay. I want to save a lot more people!

ID=45974006
Well ... I see ...? I really appreciate it if you will help me ...\nIs it really okay?

ID=45974007
of course! Please let me go!

ID=45974008
Hmm ... If so, I'm sorry but I beg you to thank you ...

ID=45974009
The other day, another unspecified%username% was the place where the investigation was done, and a similar illusion appears.

ID=45974010
The phantom itself was cleared up by the E.S.P unit ... something a little troubled happened

ID=45974011
Whatever comes out, leave it to me!

ID=35974001
A clown clown, Edgar appeared.

ID=35974002
... What's going on?

ID=15984001
Although it is an illusion,%username% who is engaged in battle as being a Vesi belonging to a danger class is the most suitable.\nOriginally I was planning to let our E.S.P unit process it, but it is a fact that it is a burden.

ID=15984002
No need for care,\nPlease send me out soon.

ID=15984003
It looks a little angry, is it okay? .

ID=55984001
A rogue who chased a lot of people to death grimly ...!\nWhen I remember that time, a little bad feeling emerges ...

ID=55984002
... Really.\nWell, for now, I will ask you again this time.

ID=25984001
Have not you gone yet? Hahaha, you can take a day off if you want to have a break.

ID=45984001
Good job. You returned well.

ID=45984002
Haha ... I was resentful also by the phantom opponent ...

ID=45984003
Is not it evidence that we are seriously saving that much people?\nAs a position to be protected, such a thing is not bad.

ID=45984004
By the way it seems I was talking to someone during the investigation ...\nDid something happen?

ID=45984005
Separately it is a spectacular hallucination.\nYou can also see hallucinations, so it is not amusing to hear audiophasia.

ID=45984006
It's not ...\nNo, it's impossible ...

ID=45984007
Oh, did you come by Tenebris?\nIf you have something to know, please tell me everything.

ID=45984008
Because it may be my misunderstanding.\n... It is true that I want you to be a misunderstanding.

ID=45984009
I have to tell any misunderstanding.\nWill you tell me so that our investigation will be furious?

ID=45984010
I am sorry, but I can not say that.

ID=45984011
A bit Tene, we met someone who was not flexible like you before we came here.\nHe told me not to say anything until after the incident eventually told me to tell me.

ID=45984012
We learned then. It is said that you should keep listening persistently even if you say that you do not want to say it.\nIf you do not say it now, you will witness the persistence of our research team?

ID=45984013
I am also suffering from a feeling of wanting to say ...

ID=45984014
So why?

ID=45984015
... Here I say,%username% is dangerous.

ID=45984016
...%username% is?

ID=45984017
Please do not mind me! It is not weak enough to worry!

ID=45984018
Although it was still good if it was only the life of%username%\nIn this case, the lives of many people may be threatened.

ID=45984019
The lives of many people ...\nThere is no choice if that word is true.

ID=45984020
... Do you believe?

ID=45984021
of course! I believe Tenebris!

ID=45984022
Well then, for%username% san ... could you please just ask me a favor?

ID=45984023
Ah! Tell me what kind of wish it is!

ID=35984001
Please leave here. And do not fight here for somewhere else.

ID=15994001
Mr. Tenebris ... Your feelings to worry about me and a lot of people are fully transmitted.

ID=15994002
However, I do not know the reason, but throwing out here which is the cause of all disasters and running away ...\nDoes not it endanger the entire human race as a result?

ID=15994003
Yes! Exactly! Even if it is said that we should leave in one direction, we are in trouble!

ID=15994004
In the first place, if%username% leaves here, it will interfere with the investigation of the blank.\nPerhaps you give up the investigation and you may have to return the baggage together!

ID=15994005
Is the Star Forest Union a group that can not do anything because there is no soul worker alone?\nEven if%username% alone is gone ...

ID=15994006
It's not a simple dependency problem! Those who do not understand do not speak!

ID=15994007
Declining morale of the survey team is also a problem.\nBecause of the concern that you may be terrible at times, the number of people who will leave will be going on.

ID=15994008
In the first place, there are many people who participate in the survey just because there are soul workers.\nIf%username% is gone, the investigation team will lose its root.

ID=15994009
Of course%username% Although the collective dependence is concentrated on one person.\nWe have to understand that the investigation can proceed because there is the%username%.

ID=15994010
If so, please leave everyone.\nIt is dangerous to stop%username% in this abnormal space.

ID=15994011
I can not do that! You may have clues to save the world here.

ID=15994012
... Of course it is important to know that if you return home by hand, you will get painful eyes from great people,\nThat's a personal matter ...

ID=15994013
It is a blank space that can finally be investigated by finding things.\nIt's been 15 years since the blanks were opened, and there is no precedent as one.

ID=15994014
I can not give up the opportunity I might grasp the clues to save the people suffering from the blanks.\nAnything is okay, I will not go back until I get results here.

ID=15994015
Martin ... Today is passionate than anyone ...!

ID=15994016
I have no will to motivate myself not to want to.\nThere was no reason I came up to the commander at this age.

ID=15994017
Besides, there is no one to come here to take the command except me.\nThe wonderful one will stand out on his own regret. So, I have to do it.

ID=15994018
It is more stubborn than I thought ...\nLet's ask%username%, Are you sure that you can bear with whatever happens?

ID=15994019
Have there been times when I have no confidence even once?

ID=15994020
Yeah ...%username% was always full of confidence, acting dignified ...

ID=15994021
You certainly are strong. No one in this place can compete against you now.\nBut before then it was an ordinary human being, is not he a student?

ID=15994022
It is a time when emotions appear most clearly and clearly, and it is also a time when emotions can not be controlled at the same time.\nEven if you recognize yourself as strong, there are things that will be broken by something that is nothing.

ID=15994023
If it is a trial it has already passed many times.\nThere were times when I got lost ... Now I can say that I am confident with it.

ID=15994024
......

ID=15994025
I do not know for what reason I am trying to drive us out,\nIt is not a man who easily bends the belief.

ID=15994026
No. I think that I just do not understand how serious the current situation is.\nAgain%username% is still stubborn.

ID=15994027
I am sorry, but I will tell you the place from now on so that no one will be asked.\nPlease follow me where I was.

ID=55994001
Let's talk about it, nice.

ID=55994002
I'm sorry, can the commander wait in another place?

ID=55994003
If it's an important story, I think it is necessary for me to be a commander as well.

ID=55994004
It is a personal story.\nIf you want to know the contents, please listen to me personally later.

ID=55994005
However, I do not know if%username% will talk.

ID=55994006
Well ... I am worried about what you are talking about ...\nThere is no help if it is a personal story. understood.

ID=25994001
... Please tell me later what you talked about.

ID=65994001
I have been waiting for you.\nActually ... I am still wondering what I should do about this story.

ID=65994002
There is no need to hesitate any more.\nI have not seen much since I first met ... but please still believe me!

ID=65994003
Yes. Even if I conceal it any more, I will only give you a doubt.\n... I do not know what will happen as a result of talking, but I will prepare and talk about it.

ID=65994004
There is one thing I want to confirm just before entering the main subject.\nI told you heard a voice of unknown identity in the previous strategy, can you tell me more about that voice?

ID=65994005
voice?\nIt is ambiguous, but somehow it might have resembled my voice.

ID=65994006
It looks like%username% 's voice ... is not it?

ID=65994007
I am not convinced.

ID=65994008
... Then you do not have to hesitate to tell this content.

ID=65994009
I will ask just one thing before entering the main subject.\nDoes%username% remember the person named Iris · Yuma?

ID=65994010
No, I do not understand it at all.

ID=65994011
If so, you have to give up hurting useless expectations.\nLet 's shift to the main theme.

ID=65994012
Mr.%username% ... Do you know how you can become a different person?

ID=65994013
If you leave it blank you will gain your ability soon! It's basic common sense!

ID=65994014
No, I can not get a different ability even if I enter a blank.\nIf so, all the people of the Star Forest Allies who are entering now will also be interlocutors.

ID=65994015
Then ... did you need time since you came in?

ID=65994016
No, it's not just a matter of time.

ID=65994018
Those outside the blank seem to think that the power which the different powers received is "Seoul Energy\

ID=65994019
The power of desire, the power gained in the blank which is the mass of Desire Energy ...\nNaturally it is Desire Energy.

ID=65994020
... Hahaha ... From that story, the energy used by the different person is\n... It sounds like it is said that they are all "DESERE ENERGY" ...

ID=65994021
Yes, that's right

ID=65994022
Become What? However, the energy that the different person has is Seoul Energy!\nSuch ... I can not be using the ugly force used by Vesi!

ID=65994023
... Then, I will ask you one.\nWhat did you first see after%username% woke up outside the blank?

ID=65994024
That ... ... the world that has been destroyed ... those who go dead ...

ID=65994025
Yes ... it is the human crisis that you will see most at first after other disabilities have also lost their memory with%username%.\nAnd it will be caught by "desire" saying "Save humanity".

ID=65994026
Desire Energy is a desire energy - disabled people with many of its energies will be unable to resist new desires.\nSo there are the different powers who went outside the blanks and lost their memory ...

ID=65994027
In order to be able to help people by led by desire, to fulfill the desire to help others\nYou should have joined the Star Forest Alliance that has sloganized the relief of humanity.

ID=65994028
......

ID=65994029
Try to think about, the different abilities belong to the Starry Forest Alliance almost exceptionally,\nIt is rather strange that you contribute for humanity.

ID=65994030
Originally if there are good people, there must be a truly human being too,\nEveryone is fighting for mankind.

ID=65994031
Whatever you think, it can only explain the phenomenon that memory loss and energy of desire together created.

ID=65994032
Then what? People still fight for humanity in the Star Forest Union now ...\nDo you want to say that they all have energy like Vesi! What?

ID=65994033
Unfortunately, that's right.

ID=65994034
That ... I do not mind doing so!\nEven if it was originally Vechi's energy, it is now used for human beings!

ID=65994035
Well ... at least during the loss of memory, people of different powers will fight for humanity.\n... but the problem is%username%, you.

ID=65994036
No way ...

ID=65994037
"Soul worker" in the blank ... There were only a few awakening themselves like me.\n%username% I also knew was also a mediocre competent who used Desire Energy.

ID=65994038
However, while I was not aware,%username% became a soul worker and appeared before me.\n... If you are%username% who has a strong sense of justice, I was surely awakened to Seoul workers like me and I felt it was fighting dignifiedly.

ID=65994039
However, it was impossible to think so ...\nThe part why the blank is still trying to extract the desire of%username%, the voice that I heard before ...

ID=65994040
I was anxious ...\nPerhaps, the fear of having done "worst choice" to%username% seems to grow, I prayed that it was not so.

ID=65994041
... but I'm already convinced, so I'm talking about this.

ID=65994042
What are you talking about ...?\nWhat is the "worst choice" ... what on earth ...

ID=65994043
It is "Desire worker".

ID=65994044
I abandon my reason and just crazy just for my own desire ...\nIt is a monster that is wholly drunk by blank Desire Energy and is no longer able to distinguish between humans and even Vesi.

ID=65994045
Halle Estiaire, Lily Bloom Marchen, Stella · Univel ... and even Irwin ArcLite who is a follower.\nWhile I was in the blank, I fought with many designer workers and saved people.

ID=65994046
And%username% was always fighting together as my most reliable fighter ...\n... But I was caught up in the strategy of a certain person and released in reality. After all, I left you alone.

ID=65994047
You surely could not tolerate the burden after I disappeared and requested more power ...\nIt would be nice if it caused the soul workers to awaken, but perhaps you chose ...

ID=65994048
"Sell the soul but erase all enemies"\nYou should have accepted Desirey Energy with this desire and became a designer worker ...

ID=65994049
Sorry,%username% さ ん ...\nI left it by myself ... really, I'm sorry ...

ID=65994050
......

ID=65994051
Well then I ... how can I ...

ID=65994053
So, I wanted you to run away from here ...\nIf%username% turns into a designer worker and blows up, there is a terrible thing that can not be imagined.

ID=65994054
But if%username% will stay here, someday your shadow ... past%username% will swallow you.\nSince it is necessary to avoid only that, so we talked to him ...

ID=65994055
......

ID=65994056
A little ... Please give me some time to think.

ID=65994057
Yes, you will not be able to decide immediately ...\nI am waiting for you here.

ID=95994001
Ha ha ha! Did you ask all the stories?

ID=95994002
Tenebris was trying to hide it, but let's hear from himself.\nNow,%username%! Share important information for the future of humanity!

ID=95994003
......

ID=95994004
Um ...%username%?

ID=95994005
I'm sorry, could you just leave me alone for a while?

ID=95994006
What was that story! What?\nIt seems that%username% is getting down so far ...

ID=95994007
Sorry

ID=95994008
If you tell me what the story was about, I will make a mistake while being very powerful.

ID=95994009
Sorry ....

ID=95994010
It seems that it is not content that you can speak lightly from the expression.\nIf you do not want to talk, I will give up listening too.

ID=95994011
We are a smart research team that actually conducts surveys, tracks and finds information,\nIt is not a detective who interrogates people and makes information.

ID=95994012
......

ID=95994013
I do not know what you talked about, but you look very tired.\nFor a while leave the survey to us and rest a little%username%.

ID=95994014
Martin, that ...

ID=95994015
Oh, what is it?

ID=95994016
I did my best for those who should protect ...\nThat was it only ...

ID=95994017
... I agree. I also understand well.

ID=95994019
At one time I used the soul worker like a tool, but that was an old story.

ID=95994020
Then, I am just a "tool" ...?

ID=95994021
Well, from the point of view of the great men, I and the general soldiers are treated the same,\nAt least I think that I should never forgive people like "old-handed" like old days.

ID=95994022
I think that the current commanders have a fixed idea since they saw the disinterested people used at the time of the past war.\nIt is strong and it is a dangerous existence which is not too tired even if fighting, so you should use it.

ID=95994023
Think about it, would not it be hard if existence that has strength far apart from humans also causes a revolt?\nSo it seems that in the past Star Forest it was trying to control from the mental side.

ID=95994024
But I ... I will change that stereotype from my generation.\nTherefore, while grinding sesame to the great people, they are hitting ...

ID=95994025
I am going to use it as a tool against the different persons and soul workers who have been used as tools in the past\nI also think that it is an apology.

ID=95994026
... Martin is still a nice person.

ID=95994027
I compared to%username%.\nIn any case, please take a moment, please restore your health now even a little.

ID=45994001
Hello,%username% ... I do not feel well.

ID=45994002
Haha ... little ... There was a painful thing ...

ID=45994003
I thought that it was bad for you ... Actually, I was listening to the story secretly.

ID=45994004
Ha ... that is a shameful story ...

ID=45994005
There is nothing embarrassing ...\nAlthough it was shocking ...

ID=45994006
I also thought that I will not treat wounds even if I give life to it when I first came out of the blank ...\nThe emotions I felt at that time are certainly different from usual ...

ID=45994007
I was led by desire ... perfectly that word ...

ID=45994008
That's right ... after all, there seems to be no lie in that word ...

ID=35994001
Then ... should I leave here ...?\nIf you are here, if everyone really looks dangerous ...

ID=35994002
... There is something I want to talk a bit about that.

ID=16004001
I was wondering before ...\n%username%, are you always thinking things seriously?

ID=16004002
Of course it is a good thing to fight eagerly for the people.\nThere was definitely a lot of people who died if they were not.

ID=16004003
But, I think that it is natural to do so to salvage people.\nSo, I feel like I'm actively going to a very dangerous job.

ID=16004004
That's commonplace ...!\nI have the power to save everyone and everyone will depend on me like that!

ID=16004005
Anxiety which is always positive and glimpse from you, as I heard the words of Tenebris it is somewhat confident now.

ID=16004006
Remember what Teneburis said a while ago, do not you?\nYou said you tried to carry all the burden on your own.

ID=16004007
If anyone dies, will you feel guilty due to yourself?\nThat is a good thing for heroes in manga to do, it is not that you were a senior high school student.

ID=16004008
But I have no point to live unless I do it ...

ID=16004009
To help others ... to make the most of people is what I should do ...\nIf I could not do that, I am ...

ID=16004010
After all it seems to be the case ... If you try to do it all by yourself one day collapsing ...\nI can not say that Tenebris's guess is different ...

ID=16004011
Listen carefully%username%.\nI'm telling you to give up everything and run away.

ID=16004012
Rather, I still wish that I would always be willing to help people like you want to do.\nThere is no one to tell me to stop giving people any more.

ID=16004013
Then ... how do I do ...

ID=16004014
The others are ...\nLieutenant Colonel Benjamin and ... ... why do not you think of people around you?

ID=16004015
Huh ...?

ID=16004016
You are confronted with the crisis of this world, you are not alone.\nEveryone is fighting for one goal with the same feeling.

ID=16004017
Do you think that you are eroded by Desire Energy and become a bad guy?\nIt's okay! I will make a second hand and I will resign again! Is not it? There are lots of such scenes in manga too!

ID=16004018
... those who will help me ...

ID=16004019
Of course it will not be a translation, they should also be protected by me.

ID=16004020
Yeah ... That's right.\nStill a little you do not feel like getting on a big boat? It is reassuring that there are others to help others?

ID=56004001
I still do not understand well ...\nBut I never thought that people who should help me will help me on the contrary.

ID=56004002
... Maybe reply to Tenebris is this reply.

ID=56004003
Yup! You only have to understand that we are behind at least.\nEven if I can not help you right away ... Still trying to be useful.

ID=56004004
Oh! all right!

ID=56004005
Huhuu, thanks in the future.

ID=26004001
Huhu, do you have anything you would like to discuss further?

ID=66004001
Come, Tenebris!

ID=66004002
... I hoped it would not come.

ID=66004003
Apparently, as far as looking at all the expressions, I seem to have brought back the worst reply.

ID=66004004
There was no need to worry! I will fight to save people, with all my might!

ID=66004005
In the meantime you can be eaten by Desire Energy ... Are you OK?

ID=66004006
At that time I will think about it!\nEven if it is not me ... There are many people who will help me after me, so I am sure there will be somehow managed anyway!

ID=66004007
... I persuaded as much as I could, so I have no way to stop you.\nYou seem to have no choice but to watch how you progress from now on.

ID=66004008
Haha, will you still remain! Thank you,%username%!\nI did not get sneaky by words of ghosts!

ID=66004009
It is not a ghost, please refrain from words.

ID=66004010
But bad news to%username% who made a new determination here.\nIt seems that Junk Knight who made Kandusity disturbance was found at a time.

ID=66004011
Junk Night ... I saw it in the basement of Kandas city ...!

ID=66004012
It is Seoul Junk based on soul workers.\nThere is a high possibility that it appears as an illusion like before, but it is hard to say that it is weaker than the real one considering the precedent.

ID=66004013
There are only about%username%, the same soul worker, as a countermeasure.\nI just asked something difficult to complain.

ID=66004014
all right ...! Do not worry! I will clean up everything!

ID=66004015
You do not even feel tired.\n... Was there something that got the power like?

ID=66004016
There is nothing in particular.\nHowever, there is only a blank answer left as to whether his conclusion is truly correct.

ID=46004001
......

ID=46004002
If it is a mission report, should not I go to Martin instead of me?

ID=46004003
A bit ... I have something I want to ask and asked.

ID=46004004
Are you planning to say it is horrible now?\n... Of course, that's a wise decision.

ID=46004005
In the previous strategy%username% heard a very clear auditory listening ... is not it?\nThat is a proof that you are little bit eroded by Desire Energy.

ID=46004006
If you noticed how many people will be sacrificed by an unnecessary battle ... even now ...

ID=46004007
Tell me how to make that auditory vision extinct!

ID=46004008
......

ID=46004009
... Do you think that you can solve anything by fighting and winning?

ID=46004010
That's it! I am confident that I will not be beaten!\nWhatever trials will come ... must break through to protect people.

ID=46004011
I can not afford to be fascinated by ghosts trying to entice me!

ID=46004012
Please calm down,%username%.\nI understood the feeling well.

ID=46004013
I am calm!

ID=46004014
No, I can not see that at all.

ID=46004015
The blank stimulates the trauma and fear of the targeted human being, and guides the target to want "power".\nNow that you lost reason, you do not want to beat the enemy.

ID=46004017
Still can not retreat ...! I am!

ID=46004018
Oh, I was here.%username%! It's a request for a fairly dangerous work from the search group.

ID=46004019
What happened!

ID=46004020
Eh ... why are you so angry?\nMaybe it's a bit dangerous, so please calm down and ask me.

ID=46004021
... all right.

ID=46004022
There was sighting information of Codename Amaryllis, a research result of the Ned Company that made a noise of Candas City temporarily.\nDoes%username% know this name?

ID=46004023
... Amaryllis ...!

ID=46004024
... It is rough. Looking at that figure, it seems that the blanks have prepared a fairly powerful toy this time.

ID=46004025
I was troubled ...\nAccording to the report,%username% is Catherine, host of Amaryllis ...

ID=46004026
......

ID=46004027
Excuse me.\nI told extra things.

ID=46004028
But it certainly became it.\n%username%. You must never fight here any more.

ID=46004029
Your desire for anger is now uncontrollable as far as I can see.\nIt will absolutely take advantage of your trauma and weaknesses and erode Desire.

ID=46004030
As soon as it is done, it may be eroded by Desire Energy.

ID=46004031
Desire ...? What is that story Tenebus.\n%username% can not have Desire Energy.

ID=46004032
Is%username% originally a soul worker?\nSince Seoul Energy and Desire Energy can not coexist, no matter how much erosion is done ...

ID=46004034
Hmm ...? What on earth is that?

ID=46004035
please do not worry.\nThis is something that%username% needs to say directly, not me.

ID=46004036
Then let's ask%username% directly.

ID=46004037
%username%.\nCan you now believe that you can fight without losing yourself to Amaryllis and to the end?

ID=46004038
This is not a problem of you being strong physically strong.\nIf the spirit weakens even a little, you are completely shadowed.

ID=46004039
Please think carefully.

ID=36004001
I will do it, no, I have to do it.

ID=36004002
That child did not revive, it is just a vision.\nIf you fear backwards with things that do not exist, I can not help anyone any longer.

ID=16124001
... Yes, if you are aware of me, I naturally thought that I would answer like that.\nIt kept silent in any adversity and kept people.

ID=16124002
But the situation is different this time ... I do not know what to wake if%username% is eroded by DESERIA energy.\nPerhaps it is possible that even the heart of protecting people will disappear and become distorted.

ID=16124003
"Maybe it will not be" and "It will not be true" is not it?\nThen, I have to go.

ID=16124004
Hahaha ...%username% is more likely than anyone else ... maybe a strong sense of justice above me.

ID=16124005
In the blank of ten years ago, I can not guess what kind of thing happened to%username% and what kind of ending had happened after I became such a figure. So, I do not even know what will happen to you going on now.

ID=16124006
Can you believe me again?

ID=16124007
Of course, that child ... ... the emotional appearance of Katherine has emerged, but my heart aches\nI think I have to finish everything.

ID=56124001
I pridefully know%username%. So I know that there is no point in saying anything more.\nI feel sad this body that can not be stopped by force at such times.

ID=56124002
Then ... will you accept! What?

ID=56124003
You had better forget to send it out.\nThe destiny of people and human beings here will be dependent on%username%.

ID=56124004
Do not worry! It surely will finish properly.

ID=56124005
Even if you escape here, the crisis and threat of humanity remain intact.\nRather, whatever happens,%username% would do what you want to do.

ID=56124006
... Then keep it in your mind as much as this.

ID=56124007
The blank will also mercilessly try to destroy your heart.\nIt is a strategy that made it apparent how to exploit the past by using the phantom bother.

ID=56124008
So please withdraw as soon as your heart is about to collapse.\nDo you understand?

ID=56124009
all right! I will keep it for yourself!

ID=26124001
... Thank you.

ID=46124001
Roy ...?\nWhy are you here. Maybe the dispatch of E.S.P troops?

ID=46124002
%username% met Amaryllis and was waiting for the real figure to wake up.

ID=46124003
A true figure ...?\nExplain what you're talking about.

ID=46124004
Haha, what is this story? Do you know best of%username% himself / herself?

ID=46124005
Although it seems that it took longer than expected, I would like to congratulate you from the heart that I regained the body.\nIt was a bit of a hard time to materialize you who was only desire, but there are rewarding things.

ID=46124006
When I got out of the blanks and lost my memory, when I became completely strangely it was serious and rough!\nHahaha, I was giving up when I saw a figure that flew away as saving boring humans.

ID=46124007
If it was not even the woman I guess it was going well more ...\nWhat is it supposed to be because I am not late now?

ID=46124008
Now, I will go.\nI am preparing everything for you to go crazy.

ID=46124009
What are weird things on earth ....\nIs it like a joke when you first met?

ID=46124010
What's wrong? The body has passed for a long time, did not the spirit come back completely?\nThen, let's prepare even meat dolls lightly as a preparatory movement ...?

ID=46124011
If you send a bit of information to a foolish Star Forest it will do as usual, hahaha!

ID=46124012
You are united ....\nI see, it is a fake! No matter how much Roy is a funny guy it was not a suspicious guy!

ID=46124013
What is he saying%username%?\nYou were just a "shadow" You drove out fake items and you occupied the body, are not you?

ID=46124014
Mashita ... Is not it deserial side?

ID=46124015
Desire side ... No way!

ID=46124016
......

ID=46124017
Haha! How! I did not decently check, I talked to my old friend in a mood.\nI am very happy because it is a fighting friend who stamped humans with fun together in the blank ...

ID=46124018
Mistake mistake, do not mind!\nI do not see the extra like me like a complete black curtain! Hahaha!

ID=46124019
... I'd like to ask a little more explanation.

ID=46124020
Hahaha! I have been touched!\nThis is totally unexpected!

ID=46124021
That "shadow" is the soul spirit itself of Desire Energy.\nEspecially, the mass of desire of%username% was excellent among the many works I have seen.

ID=46124022
Even though I touched your desire a little, it exploded beautifully.\nDesire calls even greater desire. That is why it expands endlessly.

ID=46124023
So it is a providence that 'Shadow' designer is much stronger than weak emotional power like you.\nNo matter who whatever it is, the true desire is a complete body that eroded and dominated human soul energy.

ID=46124024
That's why I listen seriously ...

ID=46124025
Everything ... Why did you like dolls beyond "shadows\

ID=46124026
This murder is ...! What?\nWhat is your identity! What? Try it!

ID=46124027
Kufu ... ... haha!

ID=46124028
Well, that does not matter.\nThe prepared plan may be distorted somewhat, but it has not ended completely.

ID=46124029
Apparently the work seems to increase.\nAnything planned carefully to pull in%username% has all been wasted.

ID=46124030
Rather than waste ... It seems that it has become considerably troublesome.\nWell, let 's give the win to you guys this time only.

ID=46124031
Let's meet again.\nWhere ... I do not know how it will meet.

ID=36124001
Hey, wait! Tell me what the story is all about ...!

ID=36124002
That ... It disappeared ....

ID=66134001
I came back,%username%!\nHahaha! This time also fought well!

ID=66134002
Do not close the mouth of the legendary soul worker who was doing a good arms work with this arm!\nOh, it seems just to come, so let's ask! What's wrong?

ID=66134003
... Apparently I seem to have underestimated%username%.

ID=66134004
As you guys,%username% has been growing forever.\nYou should not have to say that you should go home even if you still have a little anxiety.

ID=66134005
Ha ha ha! What is it! Now say something about%username%!

ID=66134006
... suddenly bad, but I have to go to Grace City!

ID=66134007
Hmm ...? What errands are you, suddenly ...

ID=66134008
We have to check right away! I'll be back!

ID=66134009
Oh ... now I can also study the fantasy space.\nThere is no urgent business for the time being. Take care.

ID=66134010
... Did you find anything strange?

ID=66134011
A person who saw before has appeared suddenly, but there is nothing to be confident about yet.\nTalk back afterwards!

ID=66134012
... understood. I will be waiting so please come and go.

ID=15905001
There will be nothing I do not know.\nDo whatever, remember!

ID=15905002
Well ... I do not even know ...\nI'm sorry ...

ID=15905003
I do not mind having a trifle thing!

ID=15905004
I'm sorry, I'm sorry ...

ID=15905005
... No, if you do not know it can not be helped.\nIt was bad to press it.

ID=15905006
is it wrong ...! I have to work harder ...\nI could not win and nobody could help me ...

ID=15905007
I can not let the hero who has prevented the crisis of world destruction to take further responsibility.\nI must apologize more ... I can not yield this!

ID=15905008
I am different!

ID=15905009
No, I am!

ID=15905010
Let's get into the main subject without playing.\nIt is serious that an accident happens all over the world now.

ID=15905011
I did not play around ....\n... Is there another problem occurring?

ID=15905012
After the woman of Zion and gold armor disappeared, abnormal phenomena occurred suddenly throughout Crow Dream.\nI agree with the opinion that it prevented the destruction of the world, but now it is a bad situation.

ID=15905013
Is that ... right?\nIt is because of us ... not it?

ID=15905014
We just followed the order of the upper part.\n... But there is plenty of possibility to bear the responsibility.

ID=15905015
Haha ... I'm used to being touched with responsibility.\nIn the worst case, I will tell the members of the research team not to discipline.\nAlthough accusations are inevitable, they will not lose their workplace.

ID=15905016
It will be saved ... It will be a big problem if you lose the laboratory.

ID=15905017
I wonder what I should do ...\nI do not understand difficult things ...

ID=15905018
In place of me I want to lower my head in front of a great man ... I want to say,\nIf children do such a thing then that is sorry for disciplinary sanctions.

ID=15905019
Dig Digs who ramped up to raise Zion also completely stopped functioning,\nThe reaction of a mysterious woman who appeared suddenly disappeared with the near soul worker.

ID=15905020
Unlike other areas, this place is quiet as never as before and no problems have arisen.\nIn this situation it is said that we are asking%username% from ....

ID=15905021
I want to help something!\nNear soul workers? I wonder if I can find it?

ID=15905022
We are in a difficult situation.\nI will try hard so that the hardships so far will not become bubbles, but I can not move until I can find some clues.

ID=15905023
It is a suspicious place whether direct clues will come out in the current situation.

ID=15905024
......

ID=15905025
... Do not get too depressed.\nIf you live in that situation and you can come back, it is good.

ID=15905026
I am alive, but the near soul workers may have died ...\nI could not help it ... ....

ID=15905027
I know Sion, but nobody was able to anticipate that a woman who would retreat it in an instant would appear.\nNo one blames%username%.

ID=15905028
Besides ... there is no report that the body has been found yet?\nDisappearance is not death. I will find it.

ID=15905029
O.K. I understand ...

ID=15905030
That's right ... If you want to do something ... How about going to Amanda's place and where?

ID=15905031
I was running around here with a rough appearance from a little while ago.\nPerhaps it got something important. Go and ask.

ID=55905001
Well ... then we go to Amanda.

ID=55905002
I am sorry to have asked such a thing.\nI am also busy writing a report to excuse my great men.

ID=25905001
Please go to Dr. Sarah and Amanda. There may be some clues.

ID=65905001
......

ID=65905002
You came back well. You seem to be very depressed, but do not bother too much.\nThe most important thing is that%username% has returned safely.

ID=65905003
I could not win against Zion and Abel had disappeared ...\nI could not do anything ... but I will not be thrown away in the trash box ...?

ID=65905004
If I said that, I could not do anything.\nYou do not have to feel responsible alone.

ID=65905005
Yup ......

ID=65905006
Well, which one should I speak from ...\nTo put it briefly, the world is fussing now. It is serious that requests for assistance come from everywhere.

ID=65905007
Fussome ... Maybe, the party? Yeah, it's a party!

ID=65905008
Speaking of parties, maybe a party ...\nThe door of hell opens, the night before the tears party party ...

ID=65905009
I will go party! I want to eat lots of delicious things!

ID=65905010
... I'm sorry,%username% could not make a joke.

ID=65905011
To make a fuss is tough to do in many places. If you do not do it well, there may be someone to die.

ID=65905012
No good! Where? Where are you going to die? help!

ID=65905013
When and how will anomalous spaces that came to appear around the world, when and ...\nI do not know where and who will die ...

ID=65905014
Tell me from anywhere good ...!\nAlso ... I do not want to do anything ...!

ID=65905015
Then maybe you should ask Dr. Sarah.\nI'm sure that I have more information than I do.

ID=95905001
Did you hear the news that anomalous space appeared from Amanda?

ID=95905002
Yeah ... Everyone, I heard that it's so dangerous ... ...

ID=95905003
Well, there are cases in the past that blanks are opened all at once,\nIt has been hardly active recently, but it was not rare a couple of years ago.

ID=95905004
But the nature of the blank confirmed this time is different.\nSo now, in the Star Forest Union we are investigating the blank by calling it "ideal blank".

ID=95905005
The blank space is free to enter and leave.

ID=95905006
Yes. You mean you can come and go?

ID=95905007
Common blanks suck humans inside and there is no way to escape?\nAnd there are side effects that people who come out of the blanks lose their memory.

ID=95905008
That freely comes in and out of the anomalous empty spaces that have emerged this time.\nIt can be said that it is not a white hole and a black hole but a gate or a passage connecting here and a blank inside.

ID=95905009
Thanks to you, the Starry Forest Alliance is currently fussing inside.\nIt seems that we may be able to finish the disaster of 15 years this time, and organize a dedicated team to investigate abnormal blanks at once.

ID=95905010
Fufo ... maybe! I wonder if Abels went to play there ...?

ID=95905011
I am not sure, but probably not.\nThere is no report that abnormal whites occurred around here, so it will not be sucked in.

ID=95905012
U-u ...

ID=95905013
What are you going to do?\nAre you going to search for the near soul worker who disappeared here for a long time, or are going to investigate abnormal empty space?

ID=95905014
I ... I would like to find a near soul worker!\nDo not give up on Fu, you told me!

ID=95905015
Hehe, I thought he would say so.\nThen stay with Ruin Fortress and stay with me ...

ID=95905016
Sorry, it looks like you can not stay here.

ID=95905017
no! I will stay here and find everyone!

ID=95905018
Actually I did not want to disturb%username%, though ...

ID=95905019
No way, another task was given ...?

ID=95905020
I also heard about a while ago, but the majority of the searching forces here are scheduled to be organized into abnormal blank entry troops.

ID=95905021
Probably, Near soul worker tracking is judged to be unsuccessful and it will be to give a new job.\nHahahaha, after all the great people seem to be accustomed to using excess personnel.

ID=95905023
But if we do not find it ... it really will die ...\nMartin, may a near soul worker die?

ID=95905024
I am not going to go too.\nIt is sort of like going all the way to go killing to go scouting in a blank space that you do not know what will happen.

ID=95905025
I am fine in the research field, but this person is absolutely obedient to the order.

ID=95905026
If you know something about the near soul worker, let's get in touch right away.\nHowever, do not you think it is more meaningful to proceed with the investigation of whitespace, which is the root cause of everything now?

ID=95905027
If%username% continues looking for near soul workers for the foreseeable future, the lives of 3 or 4 people may be helped.\nBut if you miss the opportunity to enter the blank now, thousands ... No, you may lose the opportunity to save tens of thousands of people forever.

ID=95905028
That's ... yeah. ... The worst thing is the blank ...

ID=95905029
all right ...! I will also go to the blank!

ID=95905030
Thank you for your cooperation.\nHow about Dr. Sarah together? Is the space itself the energy that Dr. Sarah studies?

ID=95905031
Of course it looks interesting, but I'm interested in the energy hidden here.\nBesides, unlike Amanda, you are incompetent.

ID=95905032
all right. It is impossible to forcibly take the ordinary people who do not want to go to drift.

ID=95905033
Let us suppose that we will go to work.\nIt seems that abnormal blank space is near Rocotown, so it is confluent on site.

ID=45905001
Oh,%username%! Long time no see, eh!

ID=45905002
Miriam ~!

ID=45905003
Yeah, there were lots of things, but I did my best ...\nFeeling that a child raised carefully grew wonderfully and came back!

ID=45905004
Part Well then, are you an adult from today?

ID=35905001
............ Yup.

ID=35905002
... Miriam, head over here ~.

ID=15915001
Anyway, it was just right timing. It is a big fuss during Locotown due to the recently generated blank.

ID=15915002
Can you see that blank floating in the sky of Locotown?\nIt is an order of magnitude larger than neighboring blanks.

ID=15915003
... It is where I came!

ID=15915004
Recently, the phenomenal blanks have just started to revitalize suddenly.\nNot only that, it seems possible to enter and leave freely according to the research team's report.

ID=15915005
Thanks to everyone in Rocotown evacuating urgently ...\nOn the contrary, E.S. P, a fortified person unit of the Star Forest Alliance, is gathered at Locotown.

ID=15915006
Well ... If you can go in and get in like it, can people in the blank help?

ID=15915007
I do not know yet ...\nFrom now on, we will investigate directly by the Staff Federation Alliance.

ID=15915008
Then let's go soon! I must hit that big one and find a near soul worker!

ID=15915009
... my mother ...\nIf that disappears I guess it will solve all the ...

ID=15915010
Fortune troops are not ready yet, so I plan to go back later,\nWhat do you do with%username%? That is dangerous, but is it okay to enter?

ID=55915001
... That big one is all bad, is not it?

ID=55915002
Besides, everyone was saying ... if I go over there, I understand it all.

ID=55915003
Everyone is ... Fu and her friends?

ID=55915004
Yup! I do not really understand, but what they are supposed to do from now on is everyone's friends!

ID=55915005
That's right ... probably even if we turn all humans into enemies, we will fight for you.

ID=55915006
What about? I will not become a human enemy ~!\nEveryone, both human beings and friends!

ID=55915007
Yeah ... I guess it's safe!

ID=55915008
Well then, please wait over there first. Because I will go soon.

ID=25915001
I will follow you as soon as preparation is completed. Do not push yourself too much, do you? What?

ID=65915001
You came, I'm glad.

ID=65915002
I came! Here is Martin too! It's Martin's!

ID=65915003
Oh no. I am not a two person, but a person himself.\nAs I said before, I assumed a blank investigation officer.

ID=65915004
Of course, we will continue to manage the survey team in Ruin Fortress, so it will come and go both places.\nPerhaps when%username% comes to Ruin Fortress, I guess I'll be there, too.

ID=65915005
Can you move instantaneously? I will also be with you!

ID=65915006
No, I will use a senior executive helicopter a little earlier instead of a momentary move.

ID=65915007
You can not use it together? My feet will hurt to come so far ...

ID=65915008
Hahaha, if you are ready to abandon freedom and dedicate your heart to the Starryforest Association thoroughly while keeping a fine schedule that%username% is kept up with a murderous schedule 24 hours by human beings in the upper level I will recommend it.

ID=65915009
Well, well ... I do not know well, I'm sorry if I get mad ...

ID=65915010
No, I just spit out what I had accumulated.

ID=65915011
Well, it's useless just saying a bitches. Let's share the current situation for the moment.\n... I am just coming now, I just asked a lot of people.

ID=65915012
There is nothing but a name.\nFrom now on I call this a glass cover camp.

ID=65915013
Glass cover! I heard that it was!

ID=65915014
Well, as long as you look over there is nothing ruined.

ID=65915015
Ah! Anyone helped? I want to meet someone who was saved!

ID=65915016
Oh, that's the story ... you might as well not have much hope.\nThere were few people around this area that we first invaded.

ID=65915017
Almost ... is not it? There was only one person.\nIt is ambiguous whether it is also a person or not.

ID=65915018
Ambiguous ... not a person! What?\nI wonder if I can become a new friend ...

ID=65915019
It might be better to check directly ....\nThere is a man who deceives the name of a human who died five years ago.

ID=65915020
Fuu! After all it is your friend!

ID=65915021
Although there is no possibility,\nDo not keep your eyes full of expectations so much.

ID=65915022
Anyway, this is about what I can share ...\nIn the meantime, tremendous support is being provided from the Star Forest Alliance for unprecedented blank investigation.

ID=65915023
I have brought more than half of the troops of ESP, an interlude force unit.\nThe good man decided to finish all disasters on the ground with this blank investigation.

ID=65915024
Different capacity unit ...?\nNow we can play together ...?

ID=65915025
How is it ... Actually, it is reality that no matter how many different people gather, it will not be enough for the power of one soul worker.

ID=65915026
For the time being, I was left to do a ridiculous job of directing a different force unit.\nFortunately thanks to the kindness of all the different people, no trouble has happened.

ID=65915027
Only Amanda hated with this from the time of Ruin will not speak properly. Hahaha.

ID=65915028
Amanda is also with you? I'm going to greet you!

ID=65915029
I forcefully pulled saying I do not want to come.\nIf I do not see the beautiful body of Amanda, motivation does not occur.

ID=65915030
It is hard to ...?

ID=65915031
Hahaha, you do not have to worry because it is a joke.

ID=65915032
Because communication is important if you go into a different space. I brought some talented people with certainty.\nI am incompetent, but only the eyes that see the person are certain.

ID=65915033
Because it takes time to build a communication network, it will depend on Amanda's extraordinary ability for a while.\nMy voice echoes directly to my brain and it gets pretty shabby.

ID=65915034
Oh! Carefully ... exciting!

ID=65915035
Anyway, it is true that we are aiming at the expectations of upper part.\nSoul workers come to the mission of investigating abnormal blanks and are really saved.

ID=65915036
You may be worried about near soul workers, but please endure a little.\nMaybe it may be found here.

ID=65915037
Yup! all right!

ID=65915038
That is over from me.\nThere is no energy of Amanda who had been brought by force, so do not hesitate to try out a voice.

ID=95915001
Huh

ID=95915002
Amanda ~!\n...... that? How are you?

ID=95915003
If someone is pleased with my situation now my brain is broken, or my hobbies are pain.

ID=95915005
I think humans are consumables.\nI am measuring the limits of my patience.

ID=95915006
Well ... well ... come on ...

ID=95915007
I will do things that is good at personnel evaluation, if I do not have words, I will quit instantly and live quietly in the corner of the room.\nI do not think I'm too competent ...

ID=95915008
But compared to the work of%username% ....\nIt was not a thing to say in front of a person fighting on the job at the work place, I am sorry.

ID=95915009
No! Amanda is doing my best hard. I know that!

ID=95915010
Hehe, Thank you.\n... It was too hard for Ruin Fortress to make a mistake though.

ID=95915011
By the way did you try talking to someone over there?\nAccording to the story it seems that he was in the blank.

ID=95915012
Who was in the blank? True! What?

ID=95915013
That's right, the strongest soul worker, Teneburis, who appeared suddenly ten years ago and bounced back the strength of Vesi ...\nI do not know if he is himself or not, but if it is true it should be a great strength in the Starry Forest Alliance.

ID=95915014
As Martin says, the probability of spoofing will be high ...\nTenebris is not a lot of names, but because it is a legendary soul worker, his name is also famous.

ID=95915015
So%username% is too much ...\n...%username%?

ID=95915016
... Where is Da.

ID=95915017
Huh?

ID=95915018
Tenebrisha ... Where the Nilkkat I heard it Ito Noda.

ID=95915019
Over there ... ... I am standing alone toward the edge.\nOh, hey this ...

ID=95915020
Watcata.

ID=95915021
... I wonder what 's wrong.

ID=45915001
you are ...

ID=45915002
Hisashi Shiburadana, Tenebris.\nMasaka forget the rettar ha uh?

ID=45915003
... Of course, I will not forget.

ID=45915004
I heard that from the people of the Star Forest Union, things spewed out of the blanks lose their memory, so I thought well but the expectation seems to be in vain.

ID=45915005
%username% Hatashikani Memory Wrecker. Sono words Ha Lie Dehanai.

ID=45915006
Sonoko Ha Humanity Kininari, Human Society Kilkottoo Trendile.

is that true! What?

ID=45915008
Reason for lying now Hanaei.

ID=45915009
If your words are facts ... There is no reason for me to contend with you.\nSo, I do not think there is any reason to stare at that murderous eyes.

ID=45915010
Watashiga Why%username% Tono promise wo raketemade\nOh Mr. Tani I'm tatto idea?

ID=15925002
If your opinion is so, I have not done what I thought was right.\n... It seems that the direction is different from what you think "justice".

ID=15925003
I do not have any reason to fight even if I will contend with you any more.\n... Please, come back.

ID=15925004
Ah, now Nichiden Tyro ...\nYou, Nikha, Itka Necessinos Price Oohallasethear ....

ID=15925005
... The cost of sin?

ID=15925006
Huu ... ... my head hurts ...

ID=15925007
Nice to meet you,%username%.

ID=15925008
Well ... Fuyo! A suddenly people came in!

ID=15925009
I was in front of you from a while ago.

ID=15925010
Ahh ... Fu also used my body again ...\nUu ... ... You have to get angry ...

ID=15925011
Ah ... more than that ... Tene ... Tene ...\nUu ... Your name, I forgot it ...

ID=15925012
I do not mind tenation. Some people call me like acquaintances.

ID=15925013
Yup! Well, is Ten a ghost? He taught me that everyone I know was dead!

ID=15925014
I'm dead ... Oh, it's about me over there.\nI was surprised when I heard it for the first time that "body" had already died five years ago even though I existed here.

ID=15925015
To begin with, I am closer to the soul spirit than to say a ghost.\nWhen the body is driven to the other side, the intention to remain here has split myself into two people.

ID=15925016
What, now I am in front of you is never meant to die, so it does not change like a ghost.

ID=15925017
Oh! After all it is a ghost!\nThat over there! I have a lot of friends, so will I introduce you?

ID=15925018
... No, I will hold back. I was stared at by your friend.

ID=15925019
True ...? Everyone is kind, though ... why?

ID=15925020
Well, probably it is jealous. You do not want to pass on important people to anyone.

ID=15925021
Huh ~ ... sorry ...

ID=55925001
Good\nIf you can truly laugh ... that's enough.

ID=55925002
Hehe! You say it looks like you were a friend for some time. It is weird!

ID=55925003
Well ... it was my first meeting with me today.

ID=55925004
Both myself and you ... I have to get to each other little by little.

ID=55925005
Still, I am sorry but to speak with confidence in you\nI think you still need to watch over just a little more.

ID=55925006
Oh, yes! Sorry for coming soon! Let's play again ~!

ID=55925007
... Yes, I hope to see you again.

ID=25925001
... I suppose I will never meet again.

ID=65925001
Oh, you came to a nice place. We were about to finish the surrounding reconnaissance and we were about to organize a search group of places where we stepped on a little.

ID=65925002
Now I'm going searching for people! What?\nI am looking for a lot!

ID=65925003
It is the best scenario if found.\nEveryone who entered the blank is exceptionally powerful, so if you take them back, the war with Vesi ... I am looking forward to imagination alone.

ID=65925004
In fact, it is not a very good situation to go.\nI tried communicating in all directions with Amanda 's ability, but I did not get any income.

ID=65925005
Then I will play and play a lot!\nSomeone may come by listening to the sound!

ID=65925006
Are they good people to listen to the sound and gather?\nI do not know if monsters are coming to eat%username%.

ID=65925007
Is that so ... you can also find it on monsters ...

ID=65925008
Again, there is no other choice to walk by searching.\nI'm counting on you.

ID=65925009
Yup! I'm going for a walk with everyone ~!

ID=65925010
Currently, our biggest mission is organizing the surroundings.\nSince it is a blank space unknown what will happen, we need to secure safety before other troops come in sequentially.

ID=65925011
Even if it is a flying summer insect,\nSpeaking of great people, they must do it.

ID=65925012
It can not be helped even if it goes anywhere, let's keep it about this.\nThen let's get into the main subject.

ID=65925013
Is there a somewhat somewhat ominous building over there over there?\nIt seems to be a blank abnormal phenomenon, but from that, energy that is not extraordinary was perceived.

ID=65925014
As you get close it's quite huge energy. The investigation team who accompanied E.S. P makes it easy for us to break in.

ID=65925015
When you go over there, there are lots of monsters ...?

ID=65925016
The possibilities are high. Perhaps, are you scared?

ID=65925017
No! I thought that I could show good points to Tene!

ID=65925018
Tene ... Oh, what about that narcissist man who cheated.

ID=65925019
It may be just deceiving the name of a man who died five years ago and is preoccupied.\nYou do not have to care so much?

ID=65925020
Still I want to be a friend!

ID=65925021
I do not bother to injure enough motivation.\nI'm counting on you.

ID=45925001
Search, cheers for good work.

ID=35925001
This ... it was quite annoying.\nNo way, the remnants of Rapid Flame of Grace City will appear to such a place.

ID=15935001
Why are bad people teasing you like this ...?

ID=15935002
Like whitespace in the sky of a human city, there is exactly the same blank space in the area of ​​Vesi?

ID=15935003
Simply thought, it was just being sucked in like a human being, poor guys.\nIt's as usual to be hostile to us.

ID=15935004
For the time being, it seems that I have to ask Mr. Tenebris who has lived here for a long time.

ID=55935001
Yeah! I gotta do my best so I'm surely praising ~!

ID=55935002
Oh my, does%username% like Tenebris?

ID=55935003
Like ...? Tene is like a ghost so you can fri friends with everyone!\nSo, at first it makes me friends!

ID=55935004
Haha ... ghost friends ... scared ...\nAnyway, let's go and talk about it.

ID=25935001
Yes, you are welcome.

ID=65935001
I came back, thanks for your hard work.\nNo way that it will fight with Vesi.

ID=65935002
I did it all! How? I tried?

ID=65935003
Possibly ... did not you think that it would be resolved by dialogue?

ID=65935004
Yup! A bad monster is a bad thing that makes everyone sad!

ID=65935005
I have to kill everything so that everyone will not be sad!

ID=65935006
... Is that so.

ID=65935007
Huh? What's wrong? Do you think Tene is different?

ID=65935008
It's nothing ...\nJust ... I was surprised just because he seemed to dislike me very much.

ID=65935009
Part Well, how about you? It will be amazing ~! I fought a lot!

ID=65935010
Yes, about the battle with you "them\

ID=65935011
Well then, will you admit me! What?

ID=65935012
No, I said that I am watching you, I did not want to see simple fighting abilities.\nNot yet ... No, I'm a little more anxious about you.

ID=65935013
How ... Why! Well then, what should I do? What will you admit it!

ID=65935014
As usual, please do what you want to do. I'd like to know the true truth of%username%.

ID=65935015
Mu ... I understand. Well then, we will fight a lot more!\nBye-bye! See you later!

ID=65935016
Also .......\nRather it is true that becoming anxious enough to fight if you fight.

ID=95935001
Well ... good ... ... Ah, Welcome back%username%.

ID=95935002
Hehe ... Oh! What is this, a lot! Do you like partying or something?

ID=95935003
Well, if it was really a party, it would have been nice.\nI want to shed all this disgusting thing.

ID=95935004
It is a spirit path finder supported from Heavy Gears of Grace City.\nIt is an essential machine for reconnaissance mission to sense the flow of energy.

ID=95935005
After installing this machine, we will move it, we will detect the reaction of the surrounding Soul Energy and search it.

ID=95935006
Spirit, pass ... ... ... flow of energy ...? I do not know ...

ID=95935007
It does not matter if you do not understand. %username% should take this as it is and just install it.\nWell, even if it is installed, it will eventually be useless.

ID=95935008
Why are you going to be useless ...?

ID=95935009
What are the great people coming over on like this?\n... I will not do that attempt and action absolutely.

ID=95935010
In the opinion of Dr. Sarah, if there are so many blanks to discharge so many workers and soul workers,\nIt seems that Seoul Energy is certainly infesting everywhere.

ID=95935011
It is not a problem that there is no reaction, it seems that there is too much reaction and it can not be distinguished which is which.\nEven though I know all that, I carry this heavy machinery. Because it is a command of a great san ... hahaha.

ID=95935012
Ma ... Martin ... a bit scary ...

ID=95935013
Good ... ... ... ah, already, shoulder ...! Why did I do this ...

ID=95935014
If you have time to sort of complaints, please carry one more.\nOr did you get promoted enough to use people in your chin?

ID=95935015
Ah ... I should help out ...?

ID=95935016
No ... All right.\nBecause%username% has an important mission of setting it on the operational site.

ID=95935017
Exactly. I can not leave such a chore to those who struggle more than us.

ID=95935018
Would you also like to do a briefing?\nNow,%username%. Go ahead and set aside these areas. The more far you install it, the wider the detection range should be.

ID=95935019
Yup! I understand ~!

ID=45935001
No, the battle this time was amazing ... exactly massacres!\nThe way you destroy everything without hesitation, it was awesome!

ID=45935002
Yup! I really did my best today! I wonder if Tene also acknowledges ...

ID=35935001
Oh, is he talking about Tene or tennis?\nI do not like being able to do anything but just keep brace.

ID=35935002
Do not worry about such a line of sight, please do your best as usual.

ID=15945001
First, as a result, the search plan using Spirit Pathfinder is a failure.\n... However, it is a problem that the cause was completely different from what I expected.

ID=15945002
Spirit Pathfinder can not sense Seoul Energy at all.\nIncluding%username% and other energy from other people, all.

ID=15945003
When it broke down, Fu was saying that he would heal if he beat him with a fist!

ID=15945004
No, it can not be broken because it is a new item that was newly introduced for the investigation of the blank ...\nEven though the engineers are looking at it, now I just shake my head.

ID=15945005
Well then ... what shall we do from now?

ID=15945006
Well ... it will not be a waste of time as we can not directly judge the size of the blank so that we can find it ...

ID=15945007
Oh, can you go to Amanda once more than that?\nI was looking for%username% earlier with a serious face.

ID=15945008
Surely, it is probably that such things as having laundered too much to dry up, or forgetting to close the main hopper of the stove.\nLooking for%username% is a washing line thick.

ID=15945009
Good night! Leave it to washing!

ID=15945010
Of course it is a joke.\nWhen I checked the status of%username% I seemed to find something strange and I am doing checks over and over.

ID=55945001
Yup! I'll be back!

ID=25945001
Take care. I will see you off here.

ID=65945001
Ah. %username%, I came!\nI'm busy but I'm sorry for calling you one time.

ID=65945002
Leave it to me if you wash it! I will do my best!

ID=65945003
Washing ...? Oh, Martin's story did some strange stories again.\nNo matter how much I will, I will not bother to call Seoul Worker for such a thing.

ID=65945004
I heard a little hallucinations ... I thought that if%username% I thought they knew something.

ID=65945005
Hearing audition ...?

ID=65945006
There were times when "laughing" or "came" and sometimes laughing awkward laughter.\nIt seems that it sounds close to%username%, but noise like a tinnitus is also occurring together and it's quite handy to analyze the content.

ID=65945007
Fuo! It's absolutely a ghost! I came to curse Amanda!

ID=65945008
It is a place I want to say that it is not a ghost to flowing though ...\nI do not know anything yet.

ID=65945009
I have many ghost friends, so let's be friends together!

ID=65945010
Oh ... I still do not want to be close friends with ghost friends, so please leave it ...

ID=65945011
If you do not recognize%username%, you can only do it with caution as soon as possible.\n... I do not know what I can do even if I take care.

ID=65945012
I am sorry for calling for funny things.\nI will continue to investigate this on this.

ID=65945013
Yup! If you truly ghosts, let me know.

ID=65945014
Well, I will remember.

ID=95945001
Oh, it seems to be in a good mood for quite a while,\nWas there something good too?

ID=95945002
Yup! You may be able to make ghost friends soon!

ID=95945003
ghost ...? I have never heard of such a story while I am in the blank.

ID=95945004
No! Amanda heard a voice! "Finally"! "You came" or!

ID=95945005
Voice ... Is that so ...

ID=95945006
I am sorry, I think it is not a ghost or similar.\nI expect roughly, but I will decide to watch a little more, just in case.

ID=95945007
... truly?

ID=95945008
Well, it is wrong.

ID=95945009
... Rather, the ghost may have been better.

ID=95945010
But, Amanda ... ...

ID=95945011
What's wrong? Did you suddenly become sleepy?

In the worst case, that child may rule%username% ...\nIn that case, how many human beings will die ...

... You should not think deeply about this story.\nFor me and you, for each other.

ID=95945028
......

ID=95945029
Um,%username%? Did you talk to Amanda-chan? As I said it was not a permanent business?

ID=95945030
Yeah yeah ... ....? Hey! Suddenly Martin came in front of me!

ID=95945031
What is it about? I came while calling my name with a voice with a high tension ...

ID=95945032
I was talking a little seriously, it seems I did not notice.\nWas not it something more important than that?

ID=95945033
Oh, that's right. I caught the headquarters of the guys and came to tell it.

ID=95945034
Because the machine is useless, the E.S.P unit directly inspected it and identified the places where they gathered well.\nThere seems to be a machine that collects energy, Flame Tempest.

ID=95945035
Collect energy ... Can you do such a thing with Vesi who is outside?

ID=95945036
No, this is a machine made by a human who cooperated with Vesi.\nRapid Flame was positively using at Grace City.

ID=95945037
Do you even remember%username%?\nAccording to what I heard, it seems that the incident occurred just when he was active in Grace City.

ID=95945038
Yeah, everyone ... Peeky, it disappeared ...

ID=95945039
It is a miserable machine to rupture people. Actually seeing it seems to be traumatic.

ID=95945040
I will break everything, so it's okay!

ID=95945041
After all, the solution of%username% is extreme.

ID=95945042
......

ID=95945043
What happened ... Tenebris.\nDo such a serious look.

ID=95945044
No ... nothing.\nThere was a place to think a little.

ID=45945001
It was truly a big success!\nThanks to ensuring minimum safety with active use of%username% this time\nYou finally got to call Fortune troops.

ID=35945002
Thanks to you, you said that you injured and cowards trying to escape from the blank\nIt has become possible to stop it.\nFloof ... ...%username% everyone.

ID=15955001
It seems that Miriam is coming at the dispatch of Fortune troops.\nIt seemed to be busy in assembling a medical tent, how about going to see him?

ID=55955001
Fuu! Miriam came to visit! What? I will also go ~, let's surprise together!

ID=55955002
I do not have time to play because it seems to be busy ... will you go?

ID=25955001
Oh, were not you going?

ID=65955001
Oh,%username%!\nWait a moment, let 's talk about when this tent is set up!

ID=65955002
Fuu! Your house?\nWell then, Miriam is Mama! I am a good puppy!

ID=65955003
Oh, I'm sorry ... Because the medical tent is about to bring injured people and treat them, I can not keep it.\nWhy are you a puppy any more than that?

ID=65955004
Doggie!

ID=65955005
Haha, if you see Mr. Benjamin ... heh heh.

ID=65955006
Good point ... I guess ... the tent is like this ...\n%username%, could you tell me what you were doing while I was missing you?

ID=65955007
Well ... Rapid Flame came out and played a lot!

ID=65955008
Vece who was in Grace City ... It is came to such a place ...

ID=65955009
Yup! But since I've already kicked them out now, I do not need to worry!

ID=65955010
About people sucked in? I heard that one person has not been helped yet though ...

ID=65955011
Um ... I'm sorry, when we come, nobody is here anymore ...

ID=65955012
No,%username% is nothing wrong, is it?\n... But what I can do is not likely to be much.

ID=65955013
By the way, were there really no one?\nI should be able to listen to talk about what happens if I am alone ...

ID=65955014
Ah! No ... No, there was only one ghost!\nThe name is Tene! It is not ... Tene ... Tene, you bu?

ID=65955015
Tenebris ...! What?

ID=65955016
Yes, Tenebris!\nWhy do you know Miriam?

ID=65955017
No ... nothing ...\nAs the name of the legendary soul worker who died suddenly five years ago came out, I was a little surprised ...

ID=65955018
Well ... are you so amazing? Although I could not see it strongly ...

ID=65955019
That's ... how about that? What did you talk with that person?

ID=65955020
Mu ... ... I do not really understand ...\nEvery time I meet, I am very tired ...

ID=65955021
Well, yes ... Oh, did your health seem to be okay? Memory? Who ... did not you tell me what you remember?

ID=65955022
Miriam ... even if a lot of people are asked me, I do not know ...

ID=65955023
That's right! Should I ask you directly?\nHaha, I am a bit crazy today, are not you?

ID=65955024
Oh, sorry,%username%! I have talked too much about building the camp yet!\nThe talk is here! Will you come back later?

ID=65955025
see you soon! See you next time!

ID=65955026

You may be able to do it in a hurry!\nPlease come back later ... are you all right?

Yeah ... when I am asleep, it's okay, but when I get up I get tired suddenly ...

ID=35955006
I see ... There was a request of a little bit, but should I rest a little?

ID=35955007
No! I just got tired, I will do my best!

ID=35955008
Is it really okay?

ID=35955009
Yup! Are you ok?

ID=15965001
Well then, let's spare your words and talk about work.\nRapid Flame was completely exterminated, but also a place that might be an acquaintance appeared.

ID=15965002
E.S.P unit has already abandoned the search because it is dangerous because you do not know what will come out.\nIf%username% is OK ...

ID=15965003
No, to be frank with you. I can not investigate unless it is%username%.\nPlease ask for my best regards.

ID=55965001
I found a new place! Yup! I will go!

ID=55965002
... It is truly a pleasure.

ID=25965001
Survey, thank you.

ID=45965001
you know what! There were a lot of dolls I saw before!

ID=45965002
I am also confused.\nThe enemy that appeared at that time was a figure that%username% looked like the enemy he fought before ... is that so?

ID=35965001
Yup! It was a bit strange, but I had seen it!

ID=35965002
However, I did not understand anything after all.\nHowever, Tenebrus who was living here may know something. Why do not you ask?

ID=15975001
Tenne ...

ID=15975002
What's wrong, is there something to worry about?

ID=15975003
Well ... It's not a problem ... Somehow, Fu-chan and everyone hates Tene.

ID=15975004
I will get to see him often from work, but please tell him not to take on his objection.

ID=55975001
Yeah, I will tell it properly!

ID=55975002
Well ... well, let me follow along this time.\nIf haunted, I will tell you the contents instead.

ID=25975001
Let's go together.

ID=65975001
Tene ~!

ID=65975002
I heard about%username% 's success.\nIt is really appreciated.

ID=65975003
It's not a big deal! I am just playing!

ID=65975004
While saying such a thing,%username% 's charm is to do whatever else can not be done by anyone else.

ID=65975005
But the Star Forest is not dependent on that power too much.\nIs there not anything left to be left to the people of different powers?

ID=65975006
Haha, there is no word to return.\nHowever, even if I am sorry now, I will lower my head, but my pride will fall to the bottom of the earth if it says to change.

ID=65975007
I think it is natural for people with power to fight for people without power.\n... But let's leave it all to such a girl, it is doubtful whether we can grow human beings autonomously from now on.

ID=65975008
I ... All right! I will not be able to keep ~ I guess you can protect the people everywhere.

ID=65975009
... .... Do you say such a thing ...

ID=65975010
Hmm ...?

ID=65975011
No, there is nothing. Besides that, do not you have something else to ask if you two ask me?

ID=65975012
Oh, that's right. Do you know the subway with%username% this time?\nThere appeared something like a vision there, but I wonder if there is anything to know about it.

ID=65975013
This is a place full of blanks, phenomena which can not be explained by common sense.\nBecause it is filled with Desire Energy, no matter what happens, there is nothing to be surprised about.

ID=65975014
Desire Energy ... ?! Are those words serious?

ID=65975015
Oh, did not you know?

ID=65975016
I do not know or nothing, how can I investigate the inaccessible blanks.

ID=65975017
I see ... I will have to explain from the nature of the blank.

ID=65975018
The blank is not a natural disaster nor a special space, it is a mass of enormous designer energy.\nOne big energy with the desire to "breathe everything".

ID=65975019
Therefore, in this area where we stand, Desire Energy is more familiar than air.

ID=65975020
I see ... was there reason why the Spirit Pathfinder that senses soul energy did not work?

ID=65975021
The reaction of Seoul Energy was drowned out by overwhelming Desire Energy and I could not sense anything.\nIt would have been noticed if Dr. Sarah was there, but anyway it is not when you need to say a human.

ID=65975022
No, wait ...?\nAmanda 's communication capability will be using Seoul Energy, so why can you use it?

ID=65975023
Soul Energy and Desire Energy should have had the property of extinguishing when they hit each other?

ID=65975024
......

ID=65975025
Well, if you say that,%username% can not use the power of soul worker,\nI should have said that it was good.

ID=65975026
For the time being, I will ask the person of the discrimination group investigating this energy to dispatch in the blank as promptly as possible.\n%username% is resting during that time.

ID=65975027
No! I will not rest! I can fight even more!

ID=65975028
It is dangerous to move unnecessarily, as I understood that this is the base of Desire Energy.\nYou have to know in advance what the influence is at a minimum.

ID=65975029
How about playing with Miriam instead?\nEven though I came, I seemed to be bored with nobody to treat.

ID=65975030
Oh, Miriam ...! Yup! Well then, I will go and visit Miriam!\nPlay a little bit and fight again!

ID=65975031
Do not worry about fighting and you will be playing slowly!

ID=95975001
Miriam ~! I came to play!

ID=95975002
Oh, well ...

ID=95975003
What ... What! What happened? What? People who tease Miriam scold me!

ID=95975004
Oh, it is not ... it is not so ... There are some personal concerns.

ID=95975005
Try to say to me if you worry! I also want to help Miriam!

ID=95975006
That ... that is not so serious! Just ... well ...

ID=95975007
I was talking with Tenebris earlier, did not he?\nDid not you talk something about Tenebris, me?

ID=95975008
No ... I did not have one!

ID=95975009
I see ...\nThen, what did you talk about?

ID=95975010
That is ... When I talk with Tene, Fu chan obstructed and I can not speak much.

ID=95975011
That ... that's ... no ... no ...

ID=95975012
I have a bit of trouble, but I'd like you to ask a little about%username% of the same girl.\nIs it OK?

ID=95975013
Fuu! Women's consultation! Talk about Amea?

ID=95975014
It is not like that ... it is ... no ...

ID=95975015
Well, that's not my story, but my friends! There was a man who used to be friends ...\nBut that person may have lost his memory and may not remember anything ...

ID=95975016
It looks like a novel, but the real story ... ha ...

ID=95975017
Why is Miriam worried about my friend ...?

ID=95975018
That ... ... That's right, because you are a really important friend!\nIf %%username% is also worried about something, is not it worrying about me together?

ID=95975019
Oh, that's right! Yup! all right!

ID=95975020
... So is not it? When that friend met with men ... What kind of voice should I ...?

ID=95975021
The man seems to be unaware of his friends ... I am not in the blank ... friends in the hospital! There is no compensation that I have met the man.

ID=95975022
When you call out more than anything You may be hurt if anyone is to see your eyes ...\nTrue, I wonder what I should do ... I'm troubled ...

ID=95975023
Hmm ... What's this?\nTake a lot of chocolate with Ame - chan and eat together!

ID=95975024
Haha ... as expected after all,%username% knows only that way ...

ID=95975025
It's a nice way! Because I feel better when I eat delicious items ...\nYou can be friends absolutely!

ID=95975026
I wonder if it was such a simple problem ...

ID=95975027
Wrong! If you talk to me once, it's ok! Believe me!

ID=95975028
... I wonder if that's true?\nSurely ... If you do not do anything here and you are just afraid, that's not good.

ID=95975029
Thank you,%username%! Thanks to you I have decided my mind!

ID=95975030
Oh! Well then, please call me at the cake party!

ID=95975031
Well ... Yeah ... Is that the story? Hahaha ...

ID=95975032
Oh, that's right, just a call came! It seems that Martin is calling.

ID=95975033
Martin is ...? I wonder if something was done! I will go!

ID=95975034
Yeah ... Thank you%username%! Come again!

ID=95975035
... Shall I prepare my heart?

ID=45975001
Is your vacation already OK?

ID=45975002
I came because Martin is calling, but what business do you do?

ID=45975003
I do not have any bad taste like calling me immediately after issuing a vacation order.\nI dislike most as one of the victims. That's it.

ID=45975004
When you have to take a day off, take a good rest.\nIf I have power, I intend to fight against the power of the darkness for the security of the rest of the soldiers.

ID=45975005
... Well then, do not you call it?

ID=45975006
of course.\nPerhaps Miriam wanted to be alone, or something, did you send%username% to me?

ID=45975007
Anyway, there is no work at rest%username%. Somewhere different ....

ID=45975008
No, it's all right now! I can fight already!

ID=45975009
Hmm ... If so, I'm sorry but I beg you to thank you ...\nIn the place where%username% did the investigation the other day, a similar illusion appears.

ID=45975010
The phantom itself was cleared up by the E.S.P unit ... something a little troubled happened

ID=35975001
A clown clown, Edgar appeared.

ID=35975002
E ... Edgar ...!

ID=15985001
Although it is an illusion,%username% who is engaged in battle as being a Vesi belonging to a danger class is the most suitable.\nOriginally I was planning to let our E.S.P unit process it, but it is a fact that it is a burden.

ID=15985002
... UU.

ID=15985003
It is a floating face. I understand that I will be tired from shortly after the last battle.\nIf the condition is not good, again%username% is resting ...

ID=15985004
No, it's okay! Like I said, I 'm fine ...

ID=15985005
I hear it is not so alright at all.

ID=55985001
No, I will go! I will never lose!

ID=55985002
... Then I beg you. Do not push yourself.

ID=25985001
Have not you gone yet? Hahaha, you can take a day off if you want to have a break.

ID=45985001
Good job. You returned well.

ID=45985002
Uu ... It was serious ...

ID=45985003
By the way it seems I was talking to someone during the investigation ...\nDid something happen?

ID=45985004
Ghosts ... I'm talking to you.\nI do not know well what he is saying ...

ID=45985005
I thought that it was a ghost and tried to be a friend ... but it seemed different ...

ID=45985006
... After all, it appears.

ID=45985007
Oh, did you come by Tenebris?\nIf you have something to know, please tell me everything.

ID=45985008
Because it may be my misunderstanding.\n... It is true that I want you to be a misunderstanding.

ID=45985009
I have to tell any misunderstanding.\nWill you tell me so that our investigation will be furious?

ID=45985010
I am sorry, but I can not say that.

ID=45985011
A bit Tene, we met someone who was not flexible like you before we came here.\nHe told me not to say anything until after the incident eventually told me to tell me.

ID=45985012
We learned then. It is said that you should keep listening persistently even if you say that you do not want to say it.\nIf you do not say it now, you will witness the persistence of our research team?

ID=45985013
I am also suffering from a feeling of wanting to say ...

ID=45985014
So why?

ID=45985015
... Here I say,%username% is dangerous.

ID=45985016
...%username% is?

ID=45985017
I am OK! Because Fu - chan and everyone are together!

ID=45985018
Do you declare that you are all right without knowing anything?

ID=45985020
But the truth I know is different in dimension than what you have ever experienced.\nYou can not trust even if you are told simply that you are confident.

ID=45985021
Well then, how strong should I be?

ID=45985022
No, it does not have to be strong.\nI have only one request to tell you.

ID=35985001
Leave here. And here we are not somewhere to fight for people.

ID=15995001
For people's safety ... leaving ...?\nWhat does that mean ...?

ID=15995002
Wait a moment ... say what you do not understand ... and leave%username%!

ID=15995003
In the first place, if%username% leaves here, it will interfere with the investigation of the blank.\nPerhaps you give up the investigation and you may have to return the baggage together!

ID=15995004
Is the Star Forest Union a group that can not do anything because there is no soul worker alone?\nEven if%username% alone is gone ...

ID=15995005
It's not a simple dependency problem! Those who do not understand do not speak!

ID=15995006
Declining morale of the survey team is also a problem.\nBecause of the concern that you may be terrible at times, the number of people who will leave will be going on.

ID=15995007
In the first place, there are many people who participate in the survey just because there are soul workers.\nIf%username% is gone, the investigation team will lose its root.

ID=15995008
Of course%username% Although the collective dependence is concentrated on one person.\nWe have to understand that the investigation can proceed because there is the%username%.

ID=15995009
If so, please leave everyone.\nIt is dangerous to stop%username% in this abnormal space.

ID=15995010
I can not do that! You may have clues to save the world here.

ID=15995011
... Of course it is important to know that if you return home by hand, you will get painful eyes from great people,\nThat's a personal matter ...

ID=15995012
It is a blank space that can finally be investigated by finding things.\nIt's been 15 years since the blanks were opened, and there is no precedent as one.

ID=15995013
I can not give up the opportunity I might grasp the clues to save the people suffering from the blanks.\nAnything is okay, I will not go back until I get results here.

ID=15995014
Funao ...! Martin, cool!

ID=15995015

Besides, there is no one to come here to take the command except me.\nThe wonderful one will stand out on his own regret. So, I have to do it.

ID=15995017
It is more stubborn than I thought ...\nLet's ask%username%, Are you sure that you can bear with whatever happens?

ID=15995018
Yup! Anything can bear! Leave it to me!

ID=15995019
If you stay here like this, you will certainly have a day to regret.\nThat's why I'm listening.

You certainly are strong.\nBut before that it is an ordinary human being and a girl.

Hmm? I am not concerned, why ...?

ID=55995002
I'm sorry, can the commander wait in another place?

ID=55995003
If it's an important story, I think it is necessary for me to be a commander as well.

ID=55995004
It is a personal story.\nIf you want to know the contents, please listen to me personally later.

Well ... So you can laugh like this.

ID=45995008
What kind of story was that! What? You should not talk to me?

I am sorry, I can not speak.

ID=45995010
Wow ~! You may teach me ~!

ID=45995011
Sorry ...\nBut if you do not remember ... I thought I better not tell it ...

ID=45995012
I started to get a bit confused, too ...

%username% ... What kind of people are there for you?

Man ...? Who is the person? Miriam? Or are they others?

ID=16005003
That's all, of all people.\nPeople who you have seen, everyone!

ID=16005004
I do not understand well ...\nSome people like Catherine are good and there are also bad uncle like Henry.

ID=16005005
Yeah. People are different from each other, so it's hard to generalize them all together.\nNo, I'm surprisedly at the core ...

ID=16005006
Well then I will change the question.\n%username% ... Do you want to hate people?

ID=16005007
I do not want to!

ID=16005008
Of course, there used to be a rampage thought of wanting to kill Henry only once.\nI reflect a lot now!

ID=16005009
so ...? Really, there is no resentment against people any more?

ID=16005010
Yup! If you ask me what I say, I will give sweets and food!

ID=16005011
... It is like a cat who thinks something about the owner as a food sourcing agent.

Ah! That's not it! I want to make lots of friends!

I can not put out the past ... but even so ...

No! Nothing! You ought to do whatever you want to do, We, Fortune units intend to support you like that forever!

ID=56005002
Do not mind what other people say, do what you want to bear! all right?

ID=56005003
all right! I am already adult enough!

ID=56005004
I do not have adults ... though.\nStill admitting that the adults are doing what they can not do.

ID=56005005
Do it in the future to like human beings ... fight for people, did you understand?

ID=56005006
Yup!

ID=26005001
Cheer up! I always support you.

ID=66005001
Tene ~!

ID=66005002
Oh, this time it's not that person.

ID=66005003
Yup! Fu chan persuaded Tene well, so I told you to talk to me quite often!

ID=66005004
It is closer to the mouth than to say persuasion.

ID=66005005
Giving up fighting here for%username% and withdrawing is a reply for the world.\nThat is why I finally decided to tell you everything.

ID=66005006
I refuse! I definitely will not withdraw!\nMany people are dangerous here because I am here ... I will save them!

ID=66005007
... I persuaded as much as I could, so I have no way to stop you.\nYou seem to have no choice but to watch how you progress from now on.

ID=66005008
Hahaha, I was prepared for a strong, I showed you%username%!\nI did not get sneaky by words of ghosts!

ID=66005009
It is not a ghost, please refrain from words.

ID=66005010
But bad news to%username% who made a new determination here.

ID=66005011
Mashita ... No way, someone died ...?

ID=66005012
No, again, there is only the excellent people from the search group as E.S. P, a force-force unit.\nI picked up only necessary information and returned safely without injuries.

ID=66005013
However, as I said earlier, I have bad news.\nIt seems that Junk Knight who made Kandusity disturbance was found at a time.

ID=66005014
If it is a junk night ... as Katherine died ...

ID=66005015
It is Seoul Junk based on soul workers.\nThere is a high possibility that it appears as an illusion like before, but it is hard to say that it is weaker than the real one considering the precedent.

ID=66005016
There are only about%username%, the same soul worker, as a countermeasure.\nI just asked something difficult to complain.

ID=66005017
The same, soul worker ...?

ID=66005018
I'll be back soon! I'd like to make that person soonerate!

ID=66005019
You do not even feel tired.\n... Was there something that got the power like?

ID=66005020
There is nothing in particular.\nHowever, there is only a blank answer left as to whether the child's conclusion is really correct.

ID=46005001
......

ID=46005002
If it is a mission report, should not I go to Martin instead of me?

ID=46005003
Tene ... that ...

ID=46005004
Are you planning to say it is horrible now?\n... Of course, that's a wise decision.

ID=46005005
In the previous strategy%username% heard a very clear auditory listening ... is not it?\nThat is a proof that you are little bit eroded by Desire Energy.

ID=46005006
Even now if it is frightening you should still run away ... If you do not do that ...

ID=46005007
Tell the child ... let me know how to meet!

ID=46005008
......

ID=46005009
Rather than escape and fight ... Are you sure you want to meet?

ID=46005010
Yup! I do not know who it is but I misunderstood something!

ID=46005011
That's why I will go and tell you! I will say that humans are not bad!\nThat child ... I certainly have something misunderstood!

ID=46005012
I certainly think that it is a child who grew up without being able to be loved ...\nI guess surely people also hate ...

ID=46005013
Please calm down,%username%.\n... Please wipe the tears.

ID=46005014
Wow ... ?!\nOh ... do not cry! Because crying is a child ...!

ID=46005015
Yes, you did not simply cry or shed tears.\n"Sadness" in you is upsetting, the emotions are blowing up.

ID=46005016
Emotions blown out ... What is that?

ID=46005017
To explore opponents' trauma and blast emotions is the most enjoyable whitespace.\nWhat it is, acts that human beings desire something ... Once you have "greed" you give yourself your power.

ID=46005018
If that happens you are awakened to the Desire worker again before persuading the child ...\n... After all it will be "that child".

ID=46005019
Well ... I do not really understand!\nSuch a story is not necessary. Tell me how I can meet that child!

ID=46005020
Please listen frequently,%username%.\nIf you want to live with people in the future. Do not absolutely meet that girl ...

ID=46005021
I refuse! I am planning to meet! Meet and speak!

ID=46005022
Oh, I was here.%username%! It's a request for a fairly dangerous work from the search group.

ID=46005023
Oh, Martin! Martin also persuaded it together!

ID=46005024
Yes ... I do not know what the story was talking about ...\nI will say it earlier because it is so important to%username%.

ID=46005025
There was sighting information of Codename Amaryllis, a research result of the Ned Company that made a noise of Candas City temporarily.\nDoes%username% know this name?

ID=46005026
Catherine ...!

ID=46005027
... It is rough. Looking at that figure, it seems that the blanks have prepared a fairly powerful toy this time.

ID=46005028
I was troubled ...\nAccording to the report,%username% is a friend of Amaryllis host Katherine ...

ID=46005029
stop ...! Do not say!

ID=46005030
Excuse me.\nI told extra things.

ID=46005031
But it certainly became it.\n%username%. You must never fight here any more.

ID=46005032
The desire with your sorrow now is uncontrollably visible to me.\nIndeed the blank will let you deal with Desireia to delve into your trauma and weaknesses.

ID=46005033
If that happens, it will be a matter of time before your figure of "old days" going crazy with Desire Energy will appear.

ID=46005034
Desire ...? What is that story Tenebus.\n%username% can not have Desire Energy.

ID=46005035
Is%username% originally a soul worker?\nSince Seoul Energy and Desire Energy can not coexist, no matter how much erosion is done ...

ID=46005036
Oh, in other people you were a "soul worker".

ID=46005037
Of course, it is Seoul workers. What's wrong with that?

ID=46005038
That is ... someday not mine, but%username% says that directly.

ID=46005039
......

ID=46005040
Well then, I will ask%username% again.

ID=46005041
%username%.\nCan you be sure that you can fight with Amaryllis without losing yourself until the very end?

ID=46005042
If you think that it is over if you simply fight and win, you have to change your mind.\nAt the moment when%username% showed upset at least a little, the blank erodes%username%.

ID=46005043
......

ID=36005001
... Fighting.\nI can not forgive to make Katherine suffer again.

ID=36005002
No ... I can not!\nPlease think twice again!

ID=36005003
I refuse ...! Even erase fantasies!\nAnd I want to meet that child and talk!

ID=36005004
Absolutely you can not stay blank any more!\nBe sure to make%username% sorry for the blank ...!

ID=36005005
That's it!

ID=36005006
......

ID=36005007
Hahaha, you had better give up.\nChildren's selfishness can not be solved by words alone.

ID=16125001
... I do not have to stop stopping%username% who bothers into danger,\nI have never felt a grudge against this body that is not substantial anymore.

ID=16125002
Hahahahahahahaha was you going to stop even if you have the substance?

ID=16125003
... of course.

ID=16125004
Hun! Even if you fight you will not lose to Tene!

ID=16125005
Yes, I agree.\nOur power is influenced by the power of emotions rather than simple body competence, so the older the younger they become their power.

ID=16125006
However, the direction of the great force may be directed to human beings as it is.\nNo matter how much power you have, if the spirit of the Lord of that power collapses ...

ID=16125007
Do not worry, it looked like this and I experienced all of Tsuzenyama.\nPerhaps ... no, I definitely have a stronger spirit than those like me.

ID=16125008
Will it be a solution because I ran away here now?\nMankind has been tormented by the blank for a long time, and eventually only the war with Vesi goes on.

ID=16125009
I was terrified by the meaningless battle of the people who were sucked in from the land of others and living as they live and who fight to defend the land and the elderly people who agonize.\nIn order for me and my descendants to live a good future from now on, I want to make a blank search firm on this occasion.

ID=16125010
...\nYes, I understand.

ID=16125011
Anyway I can not stop this body any more.\nWe can only watch over you.

ID=56125001
Yup! Look! I will solve everything!

ID=56125002
Yes, I understand.\nThen only one thing at the end will be asked.

ID=56125003
Be sure to escape without thinking anything when the heart collapses.\nPlease bear in mind that this is for the sake of other people as well as%username%.

ID=56125004
no! Catherine's phantom is certainly lost!

ID=56125005
... Please be careful.

ID=26125001
... Please be careful.

ID=46125001

I am sorry. Suddenly appeared.\n%username% met Amaryllis and was waiting for the real figure to wake up.

ID=46125003
True ... appearance?

ID=46125004
Although it seems that it took longer than expected, I would like to congratulate you from the heart that I regained the body.\nIt was a bit of a hard time to materialize you who was only desire, but there are rewarding things.

ID=46125005
When I got out of the blanks and lost my memory, when I became completely strangely it was serious and rough!\nHahaha, I was giving up when I saw a figure that flew away as saving boring humans.

ID=46125006
If it was not even the woman I guess it was going well more ...\nWhat is it supposed to be because I am not late now?

ID=46125007
Now, I will go.\nI am preparing everything for you to go crazy.

ID=46125008
What is that ... Yeah ...?\nSuddenly what the story it is ... everyone?

After all it seems like "those of unexpected existence" like those of near soul workers.\nI ignore even the common provider of losing my memory if I get out of the blanks.

Well, there is no reason for us to fight here anyway.\nI think that the desire of%username% bloomed beautifully ... and since I should be back at that time to hate humans again.

To abandon human beings, hate human beings, eventually, it is a matter of course to take a cute child returning his sorrow death back to its original form.

ID=46125021
That was my way that "originally"%username% wanted.\nSo you guys both attacked humans.

Hahaha! There is no such thing!

ID=46125029
That "shadow" is the soul spirit itself of Desire Energy.\nEspecially, the mass of desire of%username% was excellent among the many works I have seen.

ID=46125030
Even though I touched a little bit, I exploded beautifully.\nDesire calls even greater desire. That is why it expands endlessly.

ID=46125031
So it is a providence that the designer of "shadow" is much stronger than the weak emotional power like that child.\nNo matter who whatever it is, the true desire is a complete body that eroded and dominated human soul energy.

ID=46125032
That's why I listen seriously ...

ID=46125033
Everything ... Why was the puppet doll over the "shadow" ...!

Well, that does not matter.\nThe prepared plan may be distorted somewhat, but it has not ended completely.

ID=46125038
Apparently the work seems to increase.\nAnything planned carefully to pull in%username% has all been wasted.

ID=46125039
Rather than waste ... It seems that it has become considerably troublesome.\nWell, let 's give the win to you guys this time only.

ID=46125040
Let's meet again.\nWhere ... I do not know how it will meet.

ID=36125001
... Hun, Ikeda ni It is erotic martha.

ID=36125002

ID=36125003

ID=36125004
Yeah, I do not really understand what it is but ....\n... I will not lose.

ID=66135001
I came back,%username%!\nHahaha! This time also fought well!

ID=66135002
Do not close the mouth of the legendary soul worker who was doing a good arms work with this arm!\nOh, it seems just to come, so let's ask! What's wrong?

ID=66135003
... Apparently I seem to have underestimated%username%.

ID=66135004
As you guys,%username% has been growing forever.\nYou should not have to say that you should go home even if you still have a little anxiety.

ID=66135005
Ha ha ha! What is it! Now say something about%username%!

ID=66135006
sorry! There is a place I have to go early now!

ID=66135007
Hmm ...? What errands are you, suddenly ...

ID=66135008
A bad person appeared! So I will go!\nI tried hard enough so it's all right, right?

ID=66135009
Oh ... now I can also study the fantasy space.\nThere is no urgent business for the time being. Take care.

ID=66135010
... Did you find anything strange?

ID=66135011
I do not know anything yet ....\nBut when I understand it, I will teach Tene too.

ID=66135012
... understood. I will be waiting so please come and go.

ID=15906001
There will be nothing I do not know.\nDo whatever, remember!

ID=15906002
Do not hesitate to ask me ... I do not understand what you are!

ID=15906003
I do not mind having a trifle thing!

ID=15906004
Just, I really do not understand ...!

ID=15906005
... No, if you do not know it can not be helped.\nIt was bad to press it.

ID=15906006
If you accuse the hero who prevented the crisis of world destruction any more, punishment is likely to come.\nIt was good that%username% came back alive.

ID=15906007
If you understand it's enough.\nWell then, do you know where the near soul worker went?

ID=15906008
do not know. Even if I keep tracking if I understand it.\nSo how's Sarah sighing?

ID=15906009
Do not ask me.\nIt is serious that an accident happens all over the world now.

ID=15906010
...? Is there another problem occurring?

ID=15906011
After the woman of Zion and gold armor disappeared, abnormal phenomena occurred suddenly throughout Crow Dream.\nI agree with the opinion that it prevented the destruction of the world, but now it is a bad situation.

ID=15906012
Is that ... right?\nIt is because of us ... not it?

ID=15906013
We just followed the order of the upper part.\n... But there is plenty of possibility to bear the responsibility.

ID=15906014
Haha ... I'm used to being touched with responsibility.\nIn the worst case, I will tell the members of the research team not to discipline.\nAlthough accusations are inevitable, they will not lose their workplace.

ID=15906015
It will be saved ... It will be a big problem if you lose the laboratory.

ID=15906016
Well then, there is no other thing to do?\nWe will go looking for them, thanks for your time.

ID=15906017
I do not return borrowing to Zion.

ID=15906018
No, it is not time to move now.

ID=15906019
Dig Digs who ramped up to raise Zion also completely stopped functioning,\nThe reaction of a mysterious woman who appeared suddenly disappeared with the near soul worker.

ID=15906020
Unlike other areas, this place is quiet as never as before and no problems have arisen.\nI just got a waste of time just returning to the scene.

ID=15906021
Even if you waste it, you got better than anything else!

ID=15906022
We regret that we are.\nI try to make the utmost effort so that my hardships are not wasted, but I think about what I can do is pray for something to be found.

ID=15906023
The situation is a situation.\nIt is doubtful whether decent information will come out, but I will contact you as soon as it is confirmed.

ID=15906024
... all right. However, please as soon as possible.

ID=15906025
Please refrain from hasty behavior.\nIf we make a mistake in the current situation, the lives of many people may be at risk.

ID=15906026
But why not stay still!\nEven though I could not do anything after saying confidently that she would rescue those children!

ID=15906027
That's right. If you say something really will do ... Will you go to Amanda 's place?

ID=15906028
I was running around here with a rough appearance from a little while ago.\nPerhaps it got something important. Go and ask.

ID=55906001
OK! Wait a moment to listen and come back!

ID=55906002
I am sorry to have asked such a thing.\nI am also busy writing a report to excuse my great men.

ID=25906001
Please go to Dr. Sarah and Amanda. There may be some clues.

ID=65906001
Oh, I came,%username%, I really appreciate your operation this time.\nDo not you have big injuries?

ID=65906002
I appreciate being worried, but I am okay with you!\nI have heard that I am busier than that, though ....

ID=65906003
That's right ... I'm really busy.\nTo put it briefly, the world is fussing now. It is serious that requests for assistance come from everywhere.

ID=65906004
... From all over the world ... What exactly is it supposed to happen?

ID=65906005
There is not a specific damage yet, but it is due to the new abnormal space.

ID=65906006
Since the reaction of Zion has disappeared, abnormal whites appearing all over the world are activating activities.\nThe response of the near soul worker who tried pursuit also disappeared completely, and it is a pity, but ... I can not spend wasted time on them anymore.

ID=65906007
It is not a waste of time! Maybe you find it better by searching!

ID=65906008
I understand the feeling, but since the word%username% is not exactly more accurate than the spacecraft,\nMost of the Star Forest Alliance will soon withdraw from here soon.

ID=65906009
Anyhow! What?\nEven for the dead Hicks, that girl ....

ID=65906010
... Then may I ask Dr. Sarah?\nI think that it is better to judge after grasping the current situation.

ID=95906001
Did you hear the news that anomalous space appeared from Amanda?

ID=95906002
I heard that something happens all over the world now.

ID=95906003
Well, there are cases in the past that blanks are opened all at once,\nIt has been hardly active recently, but it was not rare a couple of years ago.

ID=95906004
But the nature of the blank confirmed this time is different.\nSo now, in the Star Forest Union we are investigating the blank by calling it "ideal blank".

ID=95906005
What is different?

ID=95906006
I can freely go in and out.

ID=95906007
Liberty ... Even if you enter the blank, you can come out safely! What?

ID=95906008
Common blanks suck humans inside and there is no way to escape?\nAnd there are side effects that people who come out of the blanks lose their memory.

ID=95906009
That freely comes in and out of the anomalous empty spaces that have emerged this time.\nIt can be said that it is not a white hole and a black hole but a gate or a passage connecting here and a blank inside.

ID=95906010
Thanks to you, the Starry Forest Alliance is currently fussing inside.\nIt seems that we may be able to finish the disaster of 15 years this time, and organize a dedicated team to investigate abnormal blanks at once.

ID=95906011
Well then ... maybe there are Near soul workers there too?

ID=95906012
I am not sure, but probably not.\nThere is no report that abnormal whites occurred around here, so it will not be sucked in.

ID=95906013
Be careful.

ID=95906014
What are you going to do?\nAre you going to search for the near soul worker who disappeared here for a long time, or are going to investigate abnormal empty space?

ID=95906015
Do you understand my face?\nOf course I will go looking for them ... I will search until I find them.

ID=95906016
Hehe, I thought he would say so.\nThen stay with Ruin Fortress and stay with me ...

ID=95906017
Sorry, it looks like you can not stay here.

ID=95906018
eh? Who decided such a thing! What?

ID=95906019
No way, another task was given ...?

ID=95906020
I also heard about a while ago, but the majority of the searching forces here are scheduled to be organized into abnormal blank entry troops.

ID=95906021
Probably, Near soul worker tracking is judged to be unsuccessful and it will be to give a new job.\nHahahaha, after all the great people seem to be accustomed to using excess personnel.

ID=95906023
Why are you throwing what you are learning now and trying different things! What?

ID=95906024
I am not going to go too.\nIt is sort of like going all the way to go killing to go scouting in a blank space that you do not know what will happen.

ID=95906025
I am fine in the research field, but this person is absolutely obedient to the order.

ID=95906026
Even if I say such a thing ...! Are you going to obey instructions as you are?\nYou have nothing to pride! What?

ID=95906027
Well, there is not.\nBecause I work here, I have thrown away a long time ago.

ID=95906028
If you have pride in a class society like the Star Forest, what you can get is just unreasonable sanctions.\n%username% should also be understood when grown up.

ID=95906029
... It's a nice idea.

ID=95906030
As I understand something about the near soul worker, I will teach it soon.\nHowever, do not you think it is more meaningful to proceed with the investigation of whitespace, which is the root cause of everything now?

ID=95906031
The painful event that happened so far ... and the Near Soul worker project by Ned Company, the origin is all the beginnings blank.\nIt will not be that they did not exist because the blanks disappeared, but still more damage will be prevented.

ID=95906032
So I ... I think that%username% should be headed for this anomaly.\n... Well, I do not want to go alone, so it may sound like an excuse. Hahaha.

ID=95906033
Well, is not it wrong?

ID=95906034
If you want to help a lot of people ... it may be the first time to investigate the blanks.

ID=95906035
Will you cooperate with me?

ID=95906036
I cooperate, but I did not give up trying to find a near soul worker.

ID=95906037
Thank you for your cooperation.\nHow about Dr. Sarah together? Is the space itself the energy that Dr. Sarah studies?

ID=95906038
Of course it looks interesting, but I'm interested in the energy hidden here.\nBesides, unlike Amanda, you are incompetent.

ID=95906039
all right. It is impossible to forcibly take the ordinary people who do not want to go to drift.

ID=95906040
Let us suppose that we will go to work.\nIt seems that abnormal blank space is near Rocotown, so it is confluent on site.

ID=45906001
Oh,%username%! Long time no see, eh!

ID=45906002
Just a moment there was something in Loco Town! I expected to be fine!

ID=45906003
That's my line. It seems that it was seriously tough ... I was really worried.

ID=45906004
The usual thing and the Ken, I got used to it already!

ID=35906001
Ha ... I do not know if it's okay or bad ...

ID=35906002
Do not worry, do not worry!

ID=15916001
Anyway, it was just right timing. It is a big fuss during Locotown due to the recently generated blank.

ID=15916002
Can you see that blank floating in the sky of Locotown?\nIt is an order of magnitude larger than neighboring blanks.

ID=15916003
You did the place where we fell.

ID=15916004
Recently, the phenomenal blanks have just started to revitalize suddenly.\nNot only that, it seems possible to enter and leave freely according to the research team's report.

ID=15916005
Thanks to everyone in Rocotown evacuating urgently ...\nOn the contrary, E.S. P, a fortified person unit of the Star Forest Alliance, is gathered at Locotown.

ID=15916006
I heard the story easily.\nSo, what about the actual blank situation?

ID=15916007
I do not know yet ...\nFrom now on, we will investigate directly by the Staff Federation Alliance.

ID=15916008
I always thought, but I like to work hard with the Star Forest Association.

ID=15916009
That 's right ... because the% work has been solved by%username%.\nNo matter how much effort you make, you can not stand as a base for your success.

ID=15916010
Ah ... I told you that I thought like that ....\nNo ... Sounds like that only ... I'm sorry ....

ID=15916011
Haha ... but the inside of that is really terrible now.\nI think that I understand well, I think that it will be a hard time to say%username%.

ID=15916012
Do you still go? Have you forced it?

ID=55916001
Do not worry about ourselves.\nI could not save the near soul worker, but I can help a lot of people sucked into the blanks.

ID=55916002
Huhu,%username% does not change.\nSometimes it looks rough, but something that always had a strong sense of justice.

ID=55916003
Is it natural to defend a weak person when it is strong?

ID=55916005
I do not know that they are being treated unfairly, but fighting until the very end ...\n... With no doubt ...

ID=55916006
... Huh? What does that mean?

ID=55916007
No, I do not care because it is a solitary.

ID=55916008
I do not know what's inside of it, so be careful.\nWe forget Fortune troops as soon as preparation is completed.

ID=55916009
Well then, as you can get in, I will go ahead and pick up everything!

ID=25916001
I will follow you as soon as preparation is completed. Do not push yourself too much, do you? What?

ID=65916001
You came, I'm glad.

ID=65916002
What did you mean to arrive first?\nIf you have such a quick way to go, let me use it together!

ID=65916003
I also think so deeply, but it is a helicopter for executive team executives, so outside people are prohibited from boarding.\nIt seems to be an absurd privilege, but it is necessary for working with Ruin Fortress back and forth.

ID=65916004
He ... helicopter ... Uh ....

ID=65916005
Oh, can not you ride anyway if you are not good at high place.

ID=65916006
There are times when I ride it without any help, but ... I'm getting used to it ....

ID=65916007
It is inconvenient for this occasion.\nI will continue to support running around with my own feet.

ID=65916008
Let's share the current situation for the moment. There is nothing but a place, there seems to be a name at first.\nFrom now on I call this a glass cover camp.

ID=65916009
Where does the word come out when you see where in this place?

ID=65916010
If you go into that place, tell the proposing person.\nI'm just explaining the story that I heard.

ID=65916011
Of course I will say! There are plenty of names that are more perfect, such as the distorted world of Yomi and the way to the end of the destroyed empire!

ID=65916012
It is neither Yomogi nor the empire here ...\nTry speaking directly at a later time. He is a fraudulent person who died five years ago.

ID=65916013
By the way, it seems people are more than I thought,\nI wonder if all of the Star Forest Allies will gather here?

ID=65916014
It is not the last quarrel over which the human race has survived.\nIf you sweep all the troops of all you have, Crow Dream will be occupied by Vesi.

ID=65916015
However, you do not have to worry about%username%.\nAlthough few, almost all of the combat personnel belongs to the E.S.P unit ... ie, a different force unit.

ID=65916016
... Who can see only ordinary soldiers?

ID=65916017
Not fighting while flying gaudyly, there are also people who can use different abilities with assistance.\nThanks to you, apparently looks like a general soldier, but it's all elite.

ID=65916018
It would be nice if you could come back without dying during the investigation.

ID=65916019
Do not worry about that. They are all the foreigners who are used to the actual war.\nIt does not disturb the activity of%username%.

ID=65916020
I have been given a terrible task of responsibility that leads a force of force troops.\nFortunately thanks to the kindness of all the different people, no trouble has happened.

ID=65916021
Only Amanda hated with this from the time of Ruin will not speak properly. Hahaha.

ID=65916022
Oh, you have to bring it up after all.

ID=65916023
I forcefully pulled saying I do not want to come.\nIf you do not see the beautiful body of Amanda you will not get motivated.

ID=65916024
......

ID=65916025
Because it is a joke, do not look at me with such a thing.\nBecause communication is important if you go into a different space. I brought some talented people with certainty.

ID=65916026
I am incompetent, but only the eyes that see the person are certain.\nBelieve me.

ID=65916027
I want you to show me actions rather than words.

ID=65916028
Anyway, it is true that we are aiming at the expectations of upper part.\nSoul workers come to the mission of investigating abnormal blanks and are really saved.

ID=65916029
As promised by Ruin, I will tell you information on near soul workers as soon as they can be confirmed.\nMaybe it may be found here.

ID=65916030
Thanks. I have not given up yet.

ID=65916031
That is over from me.\nThere is no energy of Amanda who had been brought by force, so do not hesitate to try out a voice.

ID=95916001
Huh

ID=95916002
I do not feel fine.

ID=95916003
If someone is pleased with my situation now my brain is broken, or my hobbies are pain.

ID=95916005
I think humans are consumables.\nI am measuring the limits of my patience.

ID=95916006
Wow ... stagnant grudge is transmitted to our place ....

ID=95916007
... But it is not a position to say such a thing.\nMr. Hicks did not stop heading to the dead ground ... I have to work hard for that amortment.

ID=95916008
You did not kill me, did you?\nI do not need to feel guilty and I do not plan to blame.

ID=95916009
I appreciate saying that, but after all this burden will not disappear ...\nIt is so heavy that a person dies ...

ID=95916010
Anyway, there were various things.\nI think that%username% is also serious, but please do again.

ID=95916011
This is nice.

ID=95916012
By the way did you try talking to someone over there?\nAccording to the story it seems that he was in the blank.

ID=95916013
that person ...? Oh, who cheated the deceased's name?

ID=95916014
That's right, the strongest soul worker, Teneburis, who appeared suddenly ten years ago and bounced back the strength of Vesi ...\nI do not know if he is himself or not, but if it is true it should be a great strength in the Starry Forest Alliance.

ID=95916015
strongest ...? With such a wonderful person?

ID=95916016
It's a waste of time to explain.\nThere are reasonable reasons to be called a legend.

ID=95916017
If you tell me so far, you may want to look around the face.

ID=95916018
Oh, by the way it seems I know%username%, but have you talked before?

ID=95916019
Huh ...? Do you know about us?

ID=95916020
You do not know%username%.

ID=95916021
It is unclear whether it is a lie, but maybe if that is true.

ID=95916022
Then I want you to talk to me once. I am busy and I do not have time to talk.

ID=45916001
Hey, maybe you are Tenebris?

ID=45916002
Oh, hello.

ID=45916003
Hmm ... It looks young when it is called somehow legend or something,\nIt is older than you, is not it?

ID=45916004
Haha ... If you live long, nothing will change.\nBecause I do not get old in the blank.

ID=45916005
Certainly, that is right.

ID=45916006
Still it will not change so much with you old.\nBecause it will change only at the age of 1,2 at most, no honorific is necessary.

ID=45916007
I guess you first started talking in honorifics, is not it?

ID=45916008
This ... is like a habit.\nI do not want to have a rude impression to others, I am honorific to everyone.

ID=45916009
I do not mind having%username% talk to me for easy talking ... How is it?

ID=45916010
There is no reason to refuse such a thing. Our chefs are comfortable!

ID=45916011
Er ... Really?

ID=45916012
Huh? Because you said that at ease?

ID=45916013
... I agree.\nI asked you first ... Hahaha ...

ID=35916001
I understand ... Thank you. %username%.

ID=15926001
Tomorrow, you seem to know about us?\nCan you tell me what it is all about?

ID=15926002
I do not know what kind of questions to ask. I will answer as much as I can.

ID=15926003
Well ... when we talked about you, you should have died five years ago,\nWhy can you explain why I am still alive here?

ID=15926004
Oh, that is someone else ... No, it's "Teneburis\

ID=15926005
Let me cheat with such ambiguous answer, explain it properly.

ID=15926006
Does user%% know the existence of soul spirit in the human body?\nIt is a phenomenon that the will of a person separates from the body, but in many cases it is common for children to appear.

ID=15926007
Oh, I feel like figuring out something. Is it a child that I asked if I want some power ....

ID=15926008
A small child that appears when you desire power. ... Probably not, no doubt.\nThe soul spirit often appears depending on the desires and desires of people.

ID=15926009
It will be easy to understand if you have seen it.\nI became that soul spirit you know, it is a thing separated from the main body.

ID=15926010
Yes ... and I became in a state where I can not leave far away from the entity over there,\nI was tied up here at the closest point of the empty whirlwind.

ID=15926011
It seems like a self-locking spirit ....

ID=15926012
Yes. My body was discharged from the blank 10 years ago and only my will that I have to help people remained here as a soul spirit.\nI can not deny the expression of self-immolation spirit in that it is left unrefined.

ID=15926013
Well, indeed the real dead Teneburis is genuine, now you are also genuine?

ID=15926014
Yes. You may think like that.

ID=15926015
Ok, I got it well.\nThe next question which also serves as a judgment as to whether it is really a legendary soul worker.

ID=15926016
What has been done and what happened during the 15 years we were in the blank.\nI would like you to tell me everything I have not remembered.

ID=15926017
No matter how much I am, I can not summarize the events of 15 years into words or phrases.\nAre there more specific questions?

ID=15926018
Then tell me how I did with the blank! What kind of activity did you do?

ID=15926019
Haha ... It is a great confidence to conclude that it is active.

ID=15926020
Before answering the question I will ask you only one thing.\nDo you remember the name Jin Sapparts?

ID=15926021
Jin · Sopets ...?\nA little while ago, I felt like I heard a similar name ....

ID=15926022
There really is not any memory.

ID=15926023
Yes, there is no memory when it was left blank.\nI do not even remember why it was left blank.

ID=15926024
... understood.

ID=15926025
First of all, I remember%username% was very persistent.\nIf I thought that I was right, I could hardly hear the opinions of others.

ID=15926027
Yes, I do not understand. I often hear other people say.\nI guess it has done quite a while to quarrel with me like it.

ID=15926029
Wow ... humility is too bad I hear disgusting.\nSo, what happened?

ID=15926030
nothing special.\nAlthough we had to fight each other, they were still the same people, so we had to cooperate.

ID=15926031
What I can tell from this is about this level.\nAre you satisfied?

ID=55926001
No, it is not over yet.\nI have not heard of who the person is called "Jin · Saperts" which I said earlier.

ID=55926002
I have nothing to do with you ....

ID=55926003
If that is true, is it strange to listen first as something important?

ID=55926004
It is not a name I want to remember much.

ID=55926005
Why do not you tell me why you do not want to remember?

ID=55926006
I do not want to leave room for speculation.

ID=55926007
Huh ... I got it.\nYou are stubborn Bari Bali.

ID=55926008
I can not say I do not want to say.\nHowever, it really is not good whether you are okay if you listen to that story.

ID=55926009
what? Should we be cursed or die if we hear the story, about that?

ID=55926010
No, it is not so ...

ID=55926011
You I saw last, was not "yet" a soul worker.\n... so I'd like to confirm%username% is "why soul workers".

ID=55926013
Alright. Then what should we do?

ID=55926014
There is no need to do anything special. I just watch over the success.\nWhen I think you can talk to you, I will reveal everything.

ID=55926015
Well, I only have to talk about it for the most part, after all I do not have to do anything and just see it?

ID=55926016
There is no point in being interpreted that way, haha.

ID=55926017
Anyway, is it okay to save the world as usual?\nPlease keep your promise!

ID=55926018
Yes, of course ...

ID=25926001
... I suppose I will never meet again.

ID=65926001
Oh, you came to a nice place. We were about to finish the surrounding reconnaissance and we were about to organize a search group of places where we stepped on a little.

ID=65926002
all right. I hope everyone will save you!

ID=65926003
It is the best scenario if found.\nEveryone who entered the blank is exceptionally powerful, so if you take them back, the war with Vesi ... I am looking forward to imagination alone.

ID=65926004
In fact, it is not a very good situation to go.\nI tried communicating in all directions with Amanda 's ability, but I did not get any income.

ID=65926005
Do not actually know and find it.

ID=65926006
I was waiting for that word.\nPlease find more than just to help others, but also for the enhancement of strength.

ID=65926007
Therefore, I would like to help%username% this time as well.\nHaha, I'm just bent about leaving.

ID=65926008
Do not apologize separately, can you tell me what to do in the meantime?

ID=65926009
Currently, our biggest mission is organizing the surroundings.\nSince it is a blank space unknown what will happen, we need to secure safety before other troops come in sequentially.

ID=65926010
Even if it is a flying summer insect,\nSpeaking of great people, they must do it.

ID=65926011
Is there a somewhat somewhat ominous building over there over there?\nIt seems to be a blank abnormal phenomenon, but from that, energy that is not extraordinary was perceived.

ID=65926012
As you get close it's quite huge energy.\nThe investigation team who accompanied E.S. P makes it easy for us to break in.

ID=65926013
Just a lady goes alone? Go straight away, do not worry and wait!

ID=65926014
Oh? Today I'm more enthusiastic than usual ... was it also a good thing?

ID=65926015
Separately change with us always! As usual!

ID=65926016
Hahaha, I do not know what happened, but it is greatly appreciated that I feel motivated.\nI will ask you for your continued patronage.

ID=45926001
Search, cheers for good work.

ID=35926001
This ... it was quite annoying.\nNo way, the remnants of Rapid Flame of Grace City will appear to such a place.

ID=15936001
There is no reason ... I do not think there is any reason to follow such a place.

ID=15936002
Rather than following it, there is a high possibility that it has just been sucked into the blank.\nIt would be strange that he came all the way to such a dangerous place and hanging in with Seoul Junk.

ID=15936003
For the time being, it seems that I have to ask Mr. Tenebris who has lived here for a long time.\nWhy can you ask me if there is a Vesi here?

ID=55936001
Even if you do not do such a thing, everything should be crushed all along?

ID=55936002
I will agree with that opinion, but I will not be saved if I can do it a bit more carefully.

ID=25936001
I left it to the matter I asked for.

ID=65936001
I came back, thanks for your hard work.\nNo way that it will fight with Vesi.

ID=65936002
So, how did you do during your usual days?\nDid you want to talk about old things soon?

ID=65936003
No, not yet.\nI did not want to see the power and power of%username%.

ID=65936004
Yes, as we can not draw conclusions at once, can you wait for a while longer?

ID=65936005
I do not know what I want to know so much, but if you say you do evaluate it is OK even if you tell me about the standard?

ID=65936006
I'm sorry. I have kept you waiting ...

ID=65936007
... Well, I think that the old story is just a bonus so I do not mind listening right now,\nI will tell you if I try as usual?

ID=65936008
I will tell you after making a proper judgment.\nDid not I call out to me for other reasons than that?

ID=65936009
Try asking if the commander in the house knows something about the sudden appearance of Vesi.

ID=65936010
Probably, I think that it is not much different from what you guess.\nEven though Vesh, there is nothing never to be sucked into the blank.

ID=65936011
Even when I was actively actively engaged a lot of Vesi came in.\n... But it is weird. Vece who meets in the blank did not attack the human being unconditionally.

ID=65936012
What are you talking about? They are going to attack immediately as they see a human?

ID=65936013
Outside of the blanks because of the war, of course it was thought that way, but here it was not such a thing.\nAt least it was a tribe through which the words were communicated, and there was also a cooperation because there was a joint enemy called Seoul Junk.

ID=65936014
That's why you're not going to say "Do not fight\

ID=65936015
That ... of course.\nI do not understand the circumstances, but it is natural that you attack if you attack earlier from Vesi to protect yourself.

ID=65936016
If that is okay! Let's crush the whole thing from now on!\nThen, whenever you feel like talking about old things inside, please say it at all times!

ID=65936017
Yes ... From now on, thank you.

ID=95936001
Well ... good ... ... Ah, Welcome back%username%.

ID=95936002
What are you going to do, so much?

ID=95936003
It is a spirit path finder supported from Heavy Gears of Grace City.\nIt is an essential machine for reconnaissance mission to sense the flow of energy.

ID=95936004
Energy flow ...... Indeed, it seems to be useful to find survivors.

ID=95936005
It is so in the opinion of the great men.\nIt does not work properly.

ID=95936006
why ...? I think that we are not bad.

ID=95936007
In the opinion of Dr. Sarah, if there are so many blanks to discharge so many workers and soul workers,\nIt seems that Seoul Energy is certainly infesting everywhere.

ID=95936008
It is not a problem that there is no reaction, probably there is too much reaction and it can not distinguish which is which.\nEven though I know all that, I carry this heavy machinery. Because it is a command of a great san ... hahaha.

ID=95936009
How about throwing it all out like you and living as it is?

ID=95936010
I have no family to feed ....\nI will give up as there is ambition to earn money and make use of wings.

ID=95936011
Good ... ... ... ah, already, shoulder ...! Why did I do this ...

ID=95936012
If you have time to sort of complaints, please carry one more.\nOr did you get promoted enough to use people in your chin?

ID=95936013
Oh, shall we help you out?

ID=95936014
No ... All right.\nBecause%username% has an important mission of setting it on the operational site.

ID=95936015
Exactly. I can not leave such a chore to those who struggle more than us.

ID=95936016
Would you also like to do a briefing?\nNow,%username%. Go ahead and set aside these areas. The more far you install it, the wider the detection range should be.

ID=95936017
Oh, use it like that.\nall right. I will finish it soon!

ID=45936001
No, the battle this time was amazing ... exactly massacres!\nThe way you destroy everything without hesitation, it was awesome!

ID=45936002
Is not it a big deal, what is the state of the machine installed from that?

ID=35936001
Well, as expected it seems nothing can be expected.

ID=35936002
There is nothing that is as bad as disagreeable as the result of knowledge.

ID=15946001
Spirit Pathfinder can not sense Seoul Energy at all.\nIncluding%username% and other energy from other people, all.

ID=15946002
It is contrary to the expectation that Seoul Energy is overflowing and can not be detected.\nSo I'm investigating the cause of a simple machine failure.

ID=15946003
You mean broken?

ID=15946004
It's a brand new item that was newly introduced for blank search, so it can not be broken ...

ID=15946005
If that is the case, I will go and go and search.\nTake me around alone for a while, wait here.

ID=15946006
That's a funny story ... It will only be a waste of time, so I vote against the other way.

ID=15946007
Oh, can you go to Amanda once more than that?\nI was looking for%username% earlier with a serious face.

ID=15946008
Surely, it is probably that such things as having laundered too much to dry up, or forgetting to close the main hopper of the stove.\nLooking for%username% is a washing line thick.

ID=15946009
... Any and all, are not you thinking so far?

ID=15946010
Of course it is a joke.\nWhen I checked the status of%username% I seemed to find something strange and I am doing checks over and over.

ID=55946001
My hometown ...? There seems to be no problem in particular though?

ID=55946002
There may be something the principal does not know. There will be no loss after talking.

ID=25946001
Take care. I will see you off here.

ID=65946001
Ah. %username%, I came!\nI'm busy but I'm sorry for calling you one time.

ID=65946002
You do not have to worry. Besides that, there seems to be a weird place in my house?

ID=65946003
Oh, about the story I made to Martin.\nIt's not a serious thing, but I heard a strange voice while the strategy is in progress.

ID=65946004
voice ...?

ID=65946005
There were times when "laughing" or "came" and sometimes laughing awkward laughter.\nIt seems that it sounds close to%username%, but noise like a tinnitus is also occurring together and it's quite handy to analyze the content.

ID=65946006
Er ... Does it take something possessed by us? I feel sick.

ID=65946007
It is a place I want to say that it is not a ghost to flowing though ...\nI do not know anything yet.

ID=65946008
Uh ... no matter how much I am fighting such a thing ....

ID=65946009
Do not worry so much. I'm talking to Dr. Sarah of Ruin Fortress now.\nI am more familiar with the theory about energy than anyone, so will I wait until results come out?

ID=65946010
Yes, please.

ID=95946001
It seems that you are quite busy, have you done anything?

ID=95946002
Hmm ... I should ask him.\nPerhaps it is a ghost coming out of a blank?

ID=95946003
ghost ...? While I was in the blank, I did not see such a thing ....

ID=95946004
First of all, are you a ghost?

ID=95946005
I am one will will be tolerated. Please do not treat it appropriately.

ID=95946006
Is it the same as a ghost after all as if to say coolly as "Wakabarashi wishi"?

ID=95946007
It is completely different! Perhaps the existence you call ghost may be like me.\nI will ask you once, so what is the ghost doing?

ID=95946008
It is said that a friend in the other side seems to possess possession of something strange voice ghost.\nSaying something like 'come' or 'finally' it seems to be laughing roughly laughing. Is not this a completely ghost?

ID=95946009
... That is not it.

ID=95946010
What do you mean by that?

ID=95946011
Perhaps the existence that%username% said it should not be a ghost.\nRather, it may be a bad thing than a ghost.

ID=95946012
Can you tell me if there is something to think about?

ID=95946013
That ... I'm sorry.\nI can not tell you now.

ID=95946014
Oh, this story is also within range "I can not talk right now".\nIt will be bothersome! But I promised you to tell me when the time comes, is it useless?

ID=95946015
I do not listen now,\nPlease stop talking all of them!

ID=95946016
... of course.

ID=95946017
Oh, I was here. I looked for%username%.

ID=95946018
Did you bother to look around, was it something troubled?

ID=95946019
Haha, that's such a place.\nDid you talk to Amanda? I guess it was incomprehensible.

ID=95946020
It seems like let's examine what is like a psychic phenomenon caused by us.

ID=95946021
Is that so, did you tell me what Teneburis did?\nWhen I hear it becomes a machine that repeats only "I do not know anything".

ID=95946022
... The commander.\nI understand your feelings, but there are reasons why I do not speak to the blank ...

ID=95946023
Chit ... Also it ...\nRecently it seems to be popular to embrace the secret as much as possible.

ID=95946024
Well, that is postponement. %username%, It seems that we have located the headquarters of the people this time.

ID=95946025
Because the machine is useless, the E.S.P unit directly inspected it and identified the places where they gathered well.\nThere seems to be a machine that collects energy, Flame Tempest.

ID=95946026
Well, as expected, different force units are competent and unlike some units!

ID=95946027
Collect energy ... Can you do such a thing with Vesi who is outside?

ID=95946028
No, this is a machine made by a human who cooperated with Vesi.\nRapid Flame was positively using at Grace City.

ID=95946029
I have fought a couple of times.

ID=95946030
I only read in the report, but it was a cruel machine that injected Seoul Energy into a human being, bursting it and collecting it.

ID=95946031
I did a really terrible sight ... I still can not forget it.

ID=95946032
Thinking that, they are being inhaled from outside the blank.\nIt would not have been made in the blanks by them.

ID=95946033
Do not end it before using something with it!\nI will destroy it all, wait a moment!

ID=95946034
After all, the solution of%username% is extreme.

ID=95946035
......

ID=95946036
What happened ... Tenebris.\nDo such a serious look.

ID=95946037
No ... nothing.

ID=45946001
It was truly a big success!\nThanks to ensuring minimum safety with active use of%username% this time\nYou finally got to call Fortune troops.

ID=45946002
Thanks to you, you said that you injured and cowards trying to escape from the blank\nIt has become possible to stop it.\nFloof ... ...%username% everyone.

ID=35946001
... Martin, you seem to have learned the taste of power.

ID=15956001
It seems that Miriam is coming at the dispatch of Fortune troops.\nIt seemed to be busy in assembling a medical tent, how about going to see him?

ID=55956001
Finally came!\nA little greetings come!

ID=55956002
Have a go.

ID=25956001
Oh, were not you going?

ID=65956001
Oh,%username%!\nI am sorry, was it a bit late, is not it? It takes more time to prepare than I thought ...

ID=65956002
Do not mind it! Oh, shall we help you set up a tent?

ID=65956003
No, it's okay! Assembling of the tent is almost done!\nEven though I'm just busy, I can not increase the work of%username% any more.

ID=65956004
Do not get tired, no matter how much you work, OK.

ID=65956005
That's it. Well, could you tell me about the situation here?\nI have been preparing at Loco Town for a long time and I do not understand anything.

ID=65956006
There is nothing special to talk about so far ... but if you dare say it was about sweeping away Rapid Flame.

ID=65956007
Vece who was in Grace City ... It is came to such a place ...

ID=65956008
About people sucked in? I heard that one person has not been helped yet though ...

ID=65956009
Oh, I am still looking for you.\nIt will not be found soon.

ID=65956010
... I see.

ID=65956011
But, nobody who is still dead have been found, and no big incident has happened!\nIf you look for it over time, you will find someone alone.

ID=65956012
Oh, by the way I found one.\nIt is slightly different from saying a survivor, but a legendary soul worker called Teneburi ... ....

ID=65956013
Te ... Teneburi ...! What?

ID=65956014
... Eh, maybe you know him?

ID=65956015
No ... nothing ...\nI was surprised that the name of the legendary soul worker who died suddenly five years ago came out ...

ID=65956016
Is it true? ... I did not see the reaction just before.

ID=65956017
That's ... how about you? What did you talk with that person?

ID=65956018
Nothing else. It is just like someone who says "No, I can not say it yet" with only excuses.

ID=65956019
Well, yeah ... did not you feel better? Memory? Someone ... There is a person to remember, do not say something like that?

ID=65956020
... Why do not you ask yourself if you are concerned so much?

ID=65956021
That's right! You should listen directly, right?\nHaha, I am a bit crazy today, are not you?

ID=65956022
Oh, sorry,%username%! I have talked too much about building the camp yet!\nThe talk is here! Will you come back later?

ID=65956023
eh? The assembly of the tent was almost finished ....

ID=65956024
see you soon! See you next time!

ID=65956025
... There is something for a reason. I will come again.

ID=95956001
here we go! I have cleaned up everything this time too!

ID=95956002
It seems like that, thanks for your hard work.\nYou really do not have time to work.

ID=95956003
Oh yeah, this is usual!\nHow? Did you want to talk about old days soon?

ID=95956004
I agree.\nI understood the fact that%username% is very enthusiastic.

ID=95956005
... But I can not talk about your past yet.

ID=95956006
Do you still have enough success? Will not you save in the country?

ID=95956007
No, I know your success well.

ID=95956008
However, the "voice of the ghost" that I was talking about the other day has been on my mind for a long time.\nPerhaps you are ...

ID=95956009
Say clearly in a misguided way!\nWhat is so uneasy! What? As something happens, you can not think about me together.

ID=95956010
I'm sorry ... but it is for you too.

ID=95956011
Oh, I understand, I understand. I can not trust anyone yet I can not trust him?\nTake a look. I will do my best to help you.

ID=95956012
Yes ... I am waiting.

ID=45956001
Your frustration appears clearly on your face.\nHave you been bullied by legendary soul workers?

ID=35956001
I said that he was trying to break his promise by saying something meaningless.\nYou can not hit a ghost or a ken ....

ID=35956002
Haha, if you ask work to%username% now, the trace is going to disappear.

ID=35956003
Rather, I hope.\nBesides, I am not irritated enough to hit people I do not care about.

ID=35956004
That's good. Let's talk a little about work.

ID=15966001
Rapid Flame was completely exterminated, but a place that could not be acquired also appeared.

ID=15966002
E.S.P unit has already abandoned the search because it is dangerous because you do not know what will come out.\nIf%username% is OK ...

ID=15966003
No, to be honest. Investigation is impossible unless it is%username%.\nPlease ask for my best regards.

ID=55966001
Sounds good, like being kind and innocent!\n... Unlike someone else.

ID=55966002
Haha, I heard it ironically.\nI'm sorry for the commander who can not do anything without%username%.

ID=25966001
Survey, thank you.

ID=45966001
Chit ... As usual I am good at just losing people's mood.

ID=45966002
I am also confused.\nThe enemy that appeared at that time was a figure that%username% looked like the enemy he fought before ... is that so?

ID=35966001
There are no dolls without cut pieces of cute ... no doubt.

ID=15976001
Why did such a thing appear ...\nI may as well ask Mr. Tenebris for a moment.

ID=15976002
Will you come with me if you do not mind?\nHe does not know what I will lick, but tell me nothing.

ID=55976001
There was something I wanted to ask a lot to Tenebris.\nOK, let's go together.

ID=25976001
Let's go to see Mr. Tenebris.

ID=65976001
Hello,%username%.\nThank you again for your hard work.

ID=65976002
If you really want to work, are you going to tell me about the past about soon?

ID=65976003
... Excuse me.

ID=65976004
Well, I do not expect honesty though.

ID=65976005
Hmm? You talk very much with Tenebris.

ID=65976006
Separately I do not think so.

ID=65976007
Let's get along better with me. I guess that 's going out for so long?

ID=65976008
I wish I was told to get along with my uncle.

ID=65976009
... I miss some sort of air today.

ID=65976011
Oh, you understand well! After all I know about us well from the original?

ID=65976012
Or rather ... I was a human "I do not like" for%username%.

ID=65976013
So when I was told not to use polite language ... I was a little surprised.

ID=65976014
Hmm? Did you mean that you did something disgusting at home?

ID=65976015
I do not think so ...\nWhen I borrowed the words of%username% at that time, I seem to have been "somehow I do not like" guy.

ID=65976016
That's right. I do not know the reason, but I guess we had something to eat something.

ID=65976017
... You talk as if you know better than I do.

ID=65976018
Fairly, please leave behind the memories.\nI wonder if I can tell you about my work now.

ID=65976019
Is this about the subway with%username%?

ID=65976020
That's it. Just a strange thing just happens.

ID=65976021
This is a place full of blanks, phenomena which can not be explained by common sense.\nBecause it is filled with Desire Energy, no matter what happens, there is nothing to be surprised about.

ID=65976022
Desire Energy ... ?! Are those words serious?

ID=65976023
Oh, did not you know?

ID=65976024
I do not know or nothing, how can I investigate the inaccessible blanks.

ID=65976025
I see ... I will have to explain from the nature of the blank.

ID=65976026
The blank is not a natural disaster nor a special space, it is a mass of enormous designer energy.\nOne big energy with the desire to "breathe everything".

ID=65976027
Therefore, in this area where we stand, Desire Energy is more familiar than air.

ID=65976028
I see ... was there reason why the Spirit Pathfinder that senses soul energy did not work?

ID=65976029
The reaction of Seoul Energy was drowned out by overwhelming Desire Energy and I could not sense anything.\nIt would have been noticed if Dr. Sarah was there, but anyway it is not when you need to say a human.

ID=65976030
No, wait ...?\nAmanda 's communication capability will be using Seoul Energy, so why can you use it?

ID=65976031
Soul Energy and Desire Energy should have had the property of extinguishing when they hit each other?

ID=65976032
......

ID=65976033
Well, if you say that,%username% can not use the power of soul worker,\nI should have said that it was good.

ID=65976034
For the time being, I will ask the person of the discrimination group investigating this energy to dispatch in the blank as promptly as possible.\n%username% is resting during that time.

ID=65976035
break ...? That's what you need! I am not tired at all.

ID=65976036
It is dangerous to move unnecessarily, as I understood that this is the base of Desire Energy.\nYou have to know in advance what the influence is at a minimum.

ID=65976037
Now, as work gets full - blown, I do not have time to rest, so let 's take a rest now.\nThis is a command as a commander.

ID=65976038
I like walking around without knowing anything,\nNow I feel like fighting.

ID=65976039
Of course.\nEven if you dislike%username% you will get a lot of work.

ID=95976001
Miriam ~, I came to visit ~.

ID=95976002
Oh, well ...

ID=95976003
What awesome that sigh ....\nSomething to worry about?

ID=95976004
that is ...

ID=95976005
Oh, man! Are you worried about male relationship? Wrong?

ID=95976006
What ... what are you talking about?\nSeparately the boyfriend's story ...!

ID=95976007
I do not say "lover\

ID=95976008
Well ...

ID=95976009
By the way, when I was in Rocotown I was troubled with similar things.\nSo, after listening to the name Tenebrus ... Oh.

ID=95976010
Fluff ... I see, I see.

ID=95976011
%username% ... I'm laughing so terribly fun ...

ID=95976012
Does your relationship with him be long?

ID=95976013
Do not speak with premise as a lover from the beginning!\nis it wrong! Do not get me wrong because it is absolutely different!

ID=95976014
Well, you said that we mentioned the story of the girlfriend earlier, were not you?\nI'm not good at telling lies.

ID=95976015
Please tell the other person absolutely!\nDo not guarantee that our mouth is hard!

ID=95976016
Um, that is not my story but it's about my friends ...!

ID=95976017
I see, I will do that kind of thing.

ID=95976018
Anyways! That person, there is a man who was familiar with old times ...\nBut that person may have lost his memory and may not remember anything ...

ID=95976019
amnesia ...? Tenebrus never got out of the blank but I think that I have never lost my memory?

ID=95976020
Oh, that is ... that person, Tenebus ... no, me and that guy ...\nI met him outside the blanks, so it is not natural that Tenebrus meets for the first time in the blanks if I do not remember me?

ID=95976021
Even if you hide it separately, it makes no sense, just making the problem complicated, can you talk with Ken-chan?\nIn this case, it will not be a good consultation.

ID=95976022
That ... That's right ... Even if you try to hide it, it makes no sense ... Yeah, I understand ...

ID=95976023
I met Tenebrus after I left the blank ...\nBut that Tenebris is not out of the blank space, that is, Teneburis I have never met before.

ID=95976024
... Do you know this?

ID=95976025
Oh, I see ... I have never met, rather than memory loss. It is complicated and it is.

ID=95976026
So, Tenebris over there may not remember me, I am afraid to call out ...\nThere are many things I want to talk about ...

ID=95976027
We understand that feeling, too.\nIt's a shock if a person who likes like a different person, "Who?" Is told.

ID=95976028
Yup. Is that so ...

ID=95976029
But, rather than doing anything without doing anything like this, is there a better way to make sure?

ID=95976030
That's ... what does ...

ID=95976031
It may be hurt if a person who likes does not remember himself.\nBut what is that? If there is no memory of the opponent, I hope to make friends from now on.

ID=95976032
Do not care about your opponent's reactions and actions. Do you mind if Miriam do what you want to do?\nNothing starts if you thought about other people.

ID=95976033
... Is that so?

ID=95976034
Yes ... better than not doing anything ... not to hurt! Yup!

ID=95976035
Thank you%username%, I got a bit of a decision.

ID=95976036
Please tell us when it goes well!

ID=95976037
That ... that's not it!

ID=95976038
All right! I also played the role of Cupid of love,\nI guess I will return to my job soon.

ID=95976039
So listen to my story properly ...\nHuh

ID=45976001
Is your vacation already OK?

ID=45976002
You can do a good thing and it's full of energy!\nEverything is okay, Please do it even at home!

ID=45976003
I do not have any bad taste like calling me immediately after issuing a vacation order.\nI dislike most as one of the victims. That's it.

ID=45976004
When you have to take a day off, take a good rest.\nIf I have power, I intend to fight against the power of the darkness for the security of the rest of the soldiers.

ID=45976005
Is not it okay even if I give parentheses so much?\nOut of now I'm in a good mood in Bali, if you ask me now!

ID=45976006
Well ... I see ...? I really appreciate it if you will help me ...\nIs it really okay?

ID=45976007
... I planned to let you do it anyway, but I put parentheses.

ID=45976008
Hmm ... If so, I'm sorry but I beg you to thank you ...

ID=45976009
The other day, another unspecified%username% was the place where the investigation was done, and a similar illusion appears.

ID=45976010
The phantom itself was cleared up by the E.S.P unit ... something a little troubled happened

ID=45976011
Even if you say you are in embarrassment Is not it a big deal?

ID=35976001
A clown clown, Edgar appeared.

ID=35976002
......

ID=15986001
Although it is an illusion,%username% who is engaged in battle as being a Vesi belonging to a danger class is the most suitable.\nOriginally I was planning to let our E.S.P unit process it, but it is a fact that it is a burden.

ID=15986002
Edgar ... is that clown ...?\nSomehow, I did feel like that.

ID=15986003
It is a floating face. I understand that I will be tired from shortly after the last battle.\nIf the condition is not good, again%username% is resting ...

ID=55986001
No, I just remembered the old days.

ID=55986002
Is it really okay?

ID=55986003
Maybe it was good. I do not feel sorry for him doing so many times.

ID=55986004
Well, it's an illusion. I hope the mind is clear even a little.

ID=25986001
Have not you gone yet? Hahaha, you can take a day off if you want to have a break.

ID=45986001
Good job. You returned well.

ID=45986002
Haa ... maybe I used too much power.

ID=45986003
By the way it seems I was talking to someone during the investigation ...\nDid something happen?

ID=45986004
Jamming ... rather than saying, it is auditory hallucination.\nIt is a disgusting thing ....

ID=45986005
It seems to take possession completely of me like a ghost who said Amanda before.

ID=45986006
It's not ...\nNo, it's impossible ...

ID=45986007
Oh, did you come by Tenebris?\nIf you do not put it in parentheses in such a place, if you know something, please tell me everything.

ID=45986008
Because it may be my misunderstanding.\n... It is true that I want you to be a misunderstanding.

ID=45986009
I have to tell any misunderstanding.\nWill you tell me so that our investigation will be furious?

ID=45986010
I am sorry, but I can not say that.

ID=45986011
A bit Tene, we met someone who was not flexible like you before we came here.\nHe told me not to say anything until after the incident eventually told me to tell me.

ID=45986012
We learned then. It is said that you should keep listening persistently even if you say that you do not want to say it.\nIf you do not say it now, you will witness the persistence of our research team?

ID=45986013
I am also suffering from a feeling of wanting to say ...

ID=45986014
So why?

ID=45986015
... Here I say,%username% is dangerous.

ID=45986016
...%username% is?

ID=45986017
Am I bothering about that kind of thing, can you say something clearly?

ID=45986018
It is arrogant at an annoying level to declare that it is OK without knowing well.

ID=45986019
Oh, quite bullish?

ID=45986020
I have kept watching forever, but now I am confident.\n%username% ... ... surely you should have walked in an undesired way in the blank.

ID=45986021
I could not watch%username%'s position to the end,\nConsidering what happened so far, I can only draw out this conclusion.

ID=45986022
Even if I say such a thing without explaining circumstances, I do not understand at all what to do.

ID=45986023
... I have one single request to tell you.

ID=35986001
Leave here. And here we are not somewhere to fight for people.

ID=15996001
......

ID=15996002
Wait a moment ... say what you do not understand ... and leave%username%!

ID=15996003
In the first place, if%username% leaves here, it will interfere with the investigation of the blank.\nPerhaps you give up the investigation and you may have to return the baggage together!

ID=15996004
Is the Star Forest Union a group that can not do anything because there is no soul worker alone?\nEven if%username% alone is gone ...

ID=15996005
It's not a simple dependency problem! Those who do not understand do not speak!

ID=15996006
Declining morale of the survey team is also a problem.\nBecause of the concern that you may be terrible at times, the number of people who will leave will be going on.

ID=15996007
In the first place, there are many people who participate in the survey just because there are soul workers.\nIf%username% is gone, the investigation team will lose its root.

ID=15996008
Of course%username% Although the collective dependence is concentrated on one person.\nWe have to understand that the investigation can proceed because there is the%username%.

ID=15996009
If so, please leave everyone.\nIt is dangerous to stop%username% in this abnormal space.

ID=15996010
I can not do that! You may have clues to save the world here.

ID=15996011
... Of course it is important to know that if you return home by hand, you will get painful eyes from great people,\nThat's a personal matter ...

ID=15996012
It is a blank space that can finally be investigated by finding things.\nIt's been 15 years since the blanks were opened, and there is no precedent as one.

ID=15996013
I can not give up the opportunity I might grasp the clues to save the people suffering from the blanks.\nAnything is okay, I will not go back until I get results here.

ID=15996014
Even though I always said things that were negative all the time, it is quite ambitious this time?

ID=15996015
I am a slow starter.\nIt is troublesome to start a job, but I feel bad if I can not finish it until the end if I start once.

ID=15996016
Besides, there is no one to come here to take the command except me.\nThe wonderful one will stand out on his own regret. So, I have to do it.

ID=15996017
It is more stubborn than I thought ...\nLet's ask%username%, Are you sure that you can bear with whatever happens?

ID=15996018
Why do not you bother to tell?\nEven if there are difficult things, we will not run away!

ID=15996019
If you stay here like this, you will certainly have a day to regret.\nThat's why I'm listening.

ID=15996020
You certainly are strong.\nBut before then it was an ordinary human being, is not he a student?

ID=15996021
It is a time when emotions appear most clearly and clearly, and it is also a time when emotions can not be controlled at the same time.\nEven if you recognize yourself as strong, there are things that will be broken by something that is nothing.

ID=15996022
How many times have you thought that such an eye had happened?

ID=15996023
Although I am merciful, sometimes I wanted to run away and sometimes I tried to give up.\nThere are lots of power shortage, but we will not collapse.

ID=15996024
You seem to know a little about our old figure,\nIt's out of now when you knew it.

ID=15996025
......

ID=15996026
To be told one thing,%username% is definitely a strong person.\nThere is not only a simple force but also a mental power.

ID=15996027
Even though I'm missing this battlefield, there is nothing abnormal in my mind.\nI fought with Zion, even I saw the crisis of the destruction of the world, but it is still to be seen.

ID=15996028
... Why have you even thought about why%username% has such a strong spirit?

ID=15996029
Well, all the different powers are strong, and the%username% of the stronger soul workers is naturally ...

ID=15996030
Hehe ... ... how many misunderstandings do you guess with arbitrary speculation seems to be countless.

ID=55996001
If you do not make fun of speaking out I know greatly, what if you teach us well?

ID=55996002
... Yeah. I replaced my mind to persuade%username%.

ID=55996003
Well, you tell me! What?\nI wish I had said that from the beginning!

ID=55996004
Perhaps it should not be a good past talk.\nAnd Mr. Martin ... I'm sorry but I wish you would leave to another place.

ID=55996005
If it's an important story, I think it is necessary for me to be a commander as well.

ID=55996006
It is a personal story.\nIf you want to know the contents, please listen to me personally later.

ID=55996007
However, I do not know if%username% will talk.

ID=55996008
Well ... I am worried about what you are talking about ...\nThere is no help if it is a personal story. understood.

ID=25996001
... Please tell me later what you talked about.

ID=65996001
I have been waiting for you.\nActually ... I am still wondering what I should do about this story.

ID=65996002
Say anything, stupid in my story, as my parents actually did squid!

ID=65996003
Haha ... I'd rather have had such a funny story ...

ID=65996004
No, it's not fun.

ID=65996005
Anyhow, I'm supposed to do a pretty stupid story.

ID=65996006
There is one thing I want to confirm just before entering the main subject.\nI told you heard a voice of unknown identity in the previous strategy, can you tell me more about that voice?

ID=65996007
It was a bit ambiguous but ... I did not see it.\nIt can be said that the feature is similar to our voice?

ID=65996008
It resembles the voice of%username% ...\n... Then it seems good to talk without hesitation.

ID=65996009
I will ask only one thing first.\nDo you know that%username% is a designer worker?

ID=65996010
If Desire Energy knows it, what is it? Is it similar to a soul worker?

ID=65996011
Yes. There is a difference in the name of energy to use and the driving force of power, but you can think that it is almost unchanged.

ID=65996012
But like Vesi they were just loyal to their "desires".\nSimply hate human beings and enjoy violence ... Also, it was simply the reason that it is fun to die people.

ID=65996013
They already missed the ordinary as a human being.\nI deny everything except myself ... It was exactly how I realized desire.

ID=65996014
I fought with them many times in the blank.\nWake up as a "true" soul worker ... to protect people and "justice".

ID=65996015
Okay. Well, we also fought hard with you with awakening! I mean?

ID=65996016
%username% I know is still a mediocre competent person.\nI can not understand what has become of it after becoming this figure and being unable to leave from here.

ID=65996017
Er ... That so?

ID=65996018
Yes, it was still a leader who leads a group.\nThose who attach to%username% are attracted to your charisma and have supported your actions.

ID=65996019
Well ... it was a group of coup d'etats that was able to repel the power of me and Jin.

ID=65996020
Oh, it is a coup d'etat!\nYeah, I hate to follow other people's instructions, maybe they did it.

ID=65996021
Now casually talking about Jin,\nYou and Jin were fighting like everyday for different ideas from each other.

ID=65996022
At first it was a private matter, the next was a meaningless return, accident accidentally accident ...\n... At last it appeared up to the instigators who could cover the murder case and that crime to others.

ID=65996023
I did not mourn the death of a person, I used to feel that I felt a sense of disgust when I saw a figure slandering others by using that death.

ID=65996024
After all,%username% repulsed against the power led by me and Gin, and withdrew members who admire themselves.\nThat is the last figure of%username% I know.

ID=65996025
Why? Ultimately you mean you got a villain?

ID=65996026
It is nature's reason to divide humans into enemies.\n%username% just acted against the group's opinion and behavior,\nI do not mean to say that it is a problem.

ID=65996027
Rather, I gained the leadership to act with my own solid will.

ID=65996028
... but by all means it is a vile in this blank.

ID=65996029
Blank DESYER energy is determined to erode people with strong "desires".\nMr.%username% was able to stand on the leader by making his own power, but ... I was asked for responsibility and power.

ID=65996030
If you hope for power in the blank, you will have a different ability and become a different person.\nBut as soon as the dishonor becomes craving for power with the preparedness to throw away everything of himself ...

ID=65996031
... Become a desire worker, get more power than you wish, eventually it will blow up.

ID=65996032
... Do you guess that?

ID=65996033
The situation is too uniform to say that it is speculation.\nWhitespace tried to extract%username% 's trauma, your trauma is calling you directly.

ID=65996034
I want to reduce the risk even a bit.\nI want you to escape from this blank before%username% turns into a designer worker who kills people ...

ID=65996035
Running ... Is not it too much to say?

ID=65996036
But if you do not get away now%username% is ...!

ID=65996037
Tell me again, is that 'guess' ...?\nThere is no decent evidence ... will you decide without permission?

ID=65996038
Now I can see the figure of%username% who I knew a little bit ...

ID=65996039
I did not accept others' opinions, and I always insisted that I was right.\nTherefore, I always fought with Jin who was rigid in internal discipline.

ID=65996040
Still it seems that it was a mistake that I thought%username% changed.

ID=65996041
Leave it alone? I heard all the talks and I am busy because I help everyone.

ID=65996042
... understood.

ID=95996001
Ha ha ha! Did you ask all the stories?

ID=95996002
Tenebris was trying to hide it, but let's hear from himself.\nNow,%username%! Share important information for the future of humanity!

ID=95996003
... Chit.

ID=95996004
Um ...%username%?

ID=95996005
What's wrong! What?

ID=95996006
... No, why are you so angry?

ID=95996007
I am not angry!

ID=95996008
Even if you are looking at me, I am very angry ...\nDid Tenebris say something?

ID=95996009
It's nothing! Is not it related to you?

ID=95996010
Yes! I am silent.

ID=95996011
......

ID=95996012
Do you think that we are selfish?

ID=95996013
What is selfish if%username% is not selfish?

ID=95996014
... Is there a place to deny even a lie?

ID=95996015
It would be useless to be a fact.\nRather, I was surprised that I thought that I was myself.

ID=95996016
My house is not selfish, it is only my strong intentions from other people.

ID=95996017
%username% 's intention is not intense, are not they willingly motivated around%username%?\n%username% will make it run unconditionally, even though you obstruct the opposite opinion, what you think is right.

ID=95996018
But, there are not many people who dislikes%username%.\nEven if you act without permission, the problem will be solved, and many people who saved their lives thanks to%username%.

ID=95996019
As expected after all?

ID=95996020
Still it is hard to change.\nIt seems to have made some objections to Mr. Tenebris this time, but how about if you sometimes take a step?

ID=95996021
That ... ... this time it was various.

ID=95996022
Guess it without permission, decide what is our dangerous person. Say you give up on the blank search?

ID=95996023
It certainly does not bother me.

ID=95996024
I know what we can not get out of here like this ...\nJust as I said, what I'm talking about will be naturally only this time.

ID=95996025
... Yes, I'm begging to ask you.

ID=45996001
Hello,%username% ... My facial expressions are dark.

ID=45996002
I quarreled with my little boyfriend.

ID=45996003
You are not my boyfriend ...

ID=45996004
It is disgusting that the way you speak is serious .... Branding to human things without permission, irresponsible tea.

ID=45996005
... Yeah.

ID=45996006
I thought that it was bad for you ... Actually, I was listening to the story secretly.

ID=45996007
Haha ... the feeling that everything I know is denied ...\nIt was more shock than I thought.

ID=35996001
My opinion is ... Well ...

ID=16006001
Although I think that I will have a shoulder again when I say something like this ...\n... I do not think Tenebrus said such a thing only with ambiguous speculation.

ID=16006002
At least Tenebris I know knows not to threaten people.\nPerhaps I was worried about all the words I said to you ...

ID=16006003
enough. I knew what I meant to say.\nHaa ... anything to ask a person who fell in love wasted.

ID=16006004
Haha ... Do you agree?

ID=16006005
That guy ... saying it with a great face. If you argue, say selfishly.\nDo not want to hear any objection Would you rather face the wall?

ID=16006006
... you.

ID=16006007
I plan to repeat the mistake again ...?

ID=16006008
... mistake?

ID=16006009
I remember things when I fought against Big Puppet ...?\nIf a miracle did not happen then you were dead ...

ID=16006010
I ignored the advice of someone who ran away and fought all the time ...\nAt that time, do you think how worried I am?

ID=16006011
But what is the result as a result? That's enough.

ID=16006012
Not enough!\nYou never really thought that your choice was wrong, did not you ever have one?

ID=16006013
Naturally! If things chosen by myself get wrong, I take responsibility on my own!\nI never regretted what we decided ...!

ID=16006014
... Ah.

ID=16006015
As long as you see the reaction, there is something.

ID=56006001
At Kandusity ....

ID=56006002
... No, I'm sorry, I do not want to say that.

ID=56006003
I do not know why you are trying to ignore the words of others and adults so far.\nI have not spent a long time with you.

ID=56006004
But ... I feel occasionally turning to a person who opposes me more than necessary.\nWhether it is right or wrong, regardless of whether it is not obliged to the opponent, it is caught by obsession ...

ID=56006005
......

ID=56006006
People are not perfect. Especially%username%, frank kids who are sensitive to their feelings are easy to fail like you ...\nAdults are not ordering to fight you ... You are really worried about you.

ID=56006007
Could you please think again carefully?\nI want you to change ...%username% ...

ID=56006008
... Think about it.

ID=56006009
Yup! Now that's enough!

ID=26006001
I support you anytime.

ID=66006001
......

ID=66006002
It is disgusting when coming close with such a face ...\nPlease let me know if you have any business.

ID=66006003
A little while ago ... sorry.\n... Guess! Shoot at you.

ID=66006004
... No, it is enough if you understand my position.

ID=66006005
It was not just convincing, and what I said is not bending!\nThink about what you said a little bit and act.

ID=66006006
Haha ... After going out of the blanks, you seem to have met nice people.\nI am fortunate that you can see yourself changed as you can misplace.

ID=66006007
But ... after all it will not come out from here.

ID=66006008
You throw out important things and run away or are you bad parenthesis?\nAnd, instead of our place, I am interested.

ID=66006009
The more you fight here, the more it is eroded by Desirers ...

ID=66006010
Do not you know what to do?\nKeep silent and look.

ID=66006011
I agree ...\nAccording to the word%username%, if I do not try it yet I do not know yet ...

ID=66006012
After all I came here%username%.\nDid all the talks end?

ID=66006013
My story is over now. What's wrong?

ID=66006014
I have bad news.\nIt seems that Junk Knight who made Kandusity disturbance was found at a time.

ID=66006015
I fought with Jung Knight in Candus ....

ID=66006016
It is Seoul Junk based on soul workers.\nThere is a high possibility that it appears as an illusion like before, but it is hard to say that it is weaker than the real one considering the precedent.

ID=66006017
There are only about%username%, the same soul worker, as a countermeasure.\nI just asked something difficult to complain.

ID=66006018
No, it was just right.\nYou said you did not know what to do? If we come home safely this time, how about now to be okay?

ID=66006019
... understood.\nThen, I'll watch over you for a while.

ID=46006001
......

ID=46006002
If it is a mission report, should not I go to Martin instead of me?

ID=46006003
Do you understand what you are doing here?

ID=46006004
Are you planning to say it is horrible now?\n... Of course, that's a wise decision.

ID=46006005
In the previous strategy%username% heard a very clear auditory listening ... is not it?\nThat is a proof that you are little bit eroded by Desire Energy.

ID=46006006
As soon as you realize how many things are sacrificed by fighting quite fighting ...

ID=46006007
Wrong! It is completely different!\nI want to know how to make him boggy!

ID=46006008
... You do not know the seriousness of this matter at all.

ID=46006009
... Do you think that you can solve anything by fighting and winning?

ID=46006010
I know well that I'm not easy! You do not have to come seeking only on you!

ID=46006011
Why do not you solve everything if you defeat him?\nI will leave all such things done for me!

ID=46006012
Calm down,%username%.\n... Do you know what you are talking about now?

ID=46006013
I do not have to calm down! If you sell a fight among us, I will make you understand firmly that it is OK!

ID=46006014
I will say it again. Calm down%username%.\nIf I do not calm down, I will not say anything anymore.

ID=46006015
... Chit.

ID=46006016
It is a blank way of stimulating people like this.\nRather, as anger as%username% gets angry, it only forms the purpose of the enemy.

ID=46006017
The blank stimulates the trauma and fear of the targeted human being, and guides the target to want "power".

ID=46006018
And if the subject shows "desire" that strongly desires "power\

ID=46006019
It is also one of the phenomena created by blank desires that%username% has such anger so quickly.

ID=46006021
Well then, how do you do ...!

ID=46006022
Oh, I was here.%username%! It's a request for a fairly dangerous work from the search group.

ID=46006023
Do not worry about danger, talk to me quickly.

ID=46006024
The reply is nice ... According to the report contents received, it seems that someone who seemed to be quite a rapport appeared to%username%.

ID=46006025
That does not matter! Now I want to fight until I feel better!

ID=46006026
There was sighting information of Codename Amaryllis, a research result of the Ned Company that made a noise of Candas City temporarily.\nDoes%username% know this name?

ID=46006027
... Amaryllis ...!

ID=46006028
... It is rough. Looking at that figure, it seems that the blanks have prepared a fairly powerful toy this time.

ID=46006029
I was troubled ...\nAccording to the report,%username% is Catherine, host of Amaryllis ...

ID=46006030
Stop that story ....\nPlease ....

ID=46006031
Excuse me.\nI told extra things.

ID=46006032
But it certainly became it.\n%username%. You must never fight here any more.

ID=46006033
Your desire for anger is now uncontrollable as far as I can see.\nIt will absolutely take advantage of your trauma and weaknesses and erode Desire.

ID=46006034
Desire ...? What is that story Tenebus.\n%username% can not have Desire Energy.

ID=46006035
Is%username% originally a soul worker?\nSince Seoul Energy and Desire Energy can not coexist, no matter how much erosion is done ...

ID=46006036
Oh yeah ... others believed that you were a soul worker.

ID=46006037
Of course, it is Seoul workers. What's wrong with that?

ID=46006038
please do not worry.\nThis is something that%username% needs to say directly, not me.

ID=46006039
......

ID=36006001
understood.

ID=36006002
%username%.\nCan you now believe that you can fight without losing yourself to Amaryllis and to the end?

ID=36006003
This is not a question of whether you are physically strong or not strong.\nBecause you will be totally shadowed if the spirit collapses even a little.

ID=16126001
Everything, no matter what.\nI will go.

ID=16126002
That is not the time to put on his speech%username%! Why can not you understand?

ID=16126003
Well, let's do as you say this time.\nNo one will get hurt as I get out.

ID=16126004
To be honest, it is uneasy to face that girl ... I do not know what will become of us.\nIf we are corroded by saying desiree, everyone 's gonna be in danger?

ID=16126005
Finally changed my mind ...\nIf you understand it, you too.

ID=16126006
But, beyond that, maybe there may be something to save this world?\n... In that case, I have no choice but to go!

ID=16126007
what ...!\nDo you go even if you know that puts people at risk! What?

ID=16126008
Even now, people in this world outside this blank are more dangerous.\nI also experienced that danger in my whole body ... I lost important friends.

ID=16126009
It is better to change nothing and resolve all in danger.

ID=16126010
It is the same ... exactly the same ...\nEven in the blank, I and you were conflicting for similar reasons ...

ID=16126011
%username% always did not take risks and acted while thinking only the results ...\nBecause of the forces that support you, internally splitting happened ...

ID=56126001
Things I do not remember, we do not know!\nWe just want to do what we want to do!

ID=56126002
Hahaha, give up.\nThis man will not bend his thought.

ID=56126003
Yes ... It seems like young children not to listen to people's words.\nI knew it, but ...

ID=56126004
Nobody who keeps anything is silent.\nAll of us are finished.

ID=56126005
... I can not stop it, really.

ID=56126006
Then only one thing at the end will be asked.\nPlease escape without thinking anything when the heart collapses.

ID=56126007
I understood. I'm not stupid enough to make myself understood as being dangerous!\nDo not worry and wait there!

ID=56126008
... Thank you.

ID=26126001
... Thank you.

ID=46126001
That ... It was in Grace ....\nFrom when have you been there?

ID=46126002
I am sorry. Suddenly appeared.\n%username% met Amaryllis and was waiting for the real figure to wake up.

ID=46126003
... A true figure?

ID=46126004
Although it seems that it took longer than expected, I would like to congratulate you from the heart that I regained the body.\nIt was a bit of a hard time to materialize you who was only desire, but there are rewarding things.

ID=46126005
When I got out of the blanks and lost my memory, when I became completely strangely it was serious and rough!\nHahaha, I was giving up when I saw a figure that flew away as saving boring humans.

ID=46126006
If it was not even the woman I guess it was going well more ...\nWhat is it supposed to be because I am not late now?

ID=46126007
Now, I will go.\nI am preparing everything for you to go crazy.

ID=46126008
I thought it even when I saw him before, but I just said extra care!

ID=46126009
What's wrong? Maybe because I have not seen you for a long time, do not you get used to it?\nIf I do not know without trying to move, I will prepare the meat dolls ...

ID=46126010
If you send a bit of information to a foolish Star Forest it will do as usual, hahaha!

ID=46126011
... Are you over joking when you are joking?

ID=46126012
Oh? Do you even mention%username% as a joke?\nYou were just a "shadow" You drove out fake items and you occupied the body, are not you?

ID=46126013
Mashita ... Is not it deserial side?

ID=46126014
Desire side ... No way!

ID=46126015
......

ID=46126016
Haha! How! I did not decently check, I talked to my old friend in a mood.\nI am very happy because it is a fighting friend who stamped humans with fun together in the blank ...

ID=46126017
Mistake mistake, do not mind!\nI do not see the extra like me like a complete black curtain! Hahaha!

ID=46126018
Well, that's right.\nIt is useless if you try to laugh and make a mistake, you understand?

ID=46126019
Hahaha! I have been touched!\nThis is totally unexpected!

ID=46126020
That "shadow" is the soul spirit itself of Desire Energy.\nEspecially, the mass of desire of%username% was excellent among the many works I have seen.

ID=46126021
Even though I touched your desire a little, it exploded beautifully.\nDesire calls even greater desire. That is why it expands endlessly.

ID=46126022
So it is a providence that 'Shadow' designer is much stronger than weak emotional power like you.\nNo matter who whatever it is, the true desire is a complete body that eroded and dominated human soul energy.

ID=46126023
That's why I listen seriously ...

ID=46126024
Everything ... Why did you like dolls beyond "shadows\

ID=46126025
... It seems that the turkey has peeled off.

ID=46126026
Kufu ... ... haha!

ID=46126027
Well, that does not matter.\nThe prepared plan may be distorted somewhat, but it has not ended completely.

ID=46126028
Apparently the work seems to increase.\nAnything planned carefully to pull in%username% has all been wasted.

ID=46126029
Rather than waste ... It seems that it has become considerably troublesome.\nWell, let 's give the win to you guys this time only.

ID=46126030
Let's meet again.\nWhere ... I do not know how it will meet.

ID=36126001
wait! If it moves even a step from there ....

ID=36126002
Be careful. Had disappeared.

ID=66136001
I came back,%username%!\nHahaha! This time also fought well!

ID=66136002
Do not close the mouth of the legendary soul worker who was doing a good arms work with this arm!\nOh, it seems just to come, so let's ask! What's wrong?

ID=66136003
... Apparently I seem to have underestimated%username%.

ID=66136004
As you guys,%username% has been growing forever.\nYou should not have to say that you should go home even if you still have a little anxiety.

ID=66136005
Ha ha ha! What is it! Now say something about%username%!

ID=66136006
I want to smile with us, but I'm going to Grace City for a while.

ID=66136007
Hmm ...? What errands are you, suddenly ...

ID=66136008
If it is not my mistake in viewing, a masterpiece appeared Tatchan.\nI will investigate, I leave the investigation.

ID=66136009
Oh ... now I can also study the fantasy space.\nThere is no urgent business for the time being. Go to E17941: F19160 Welcome.

ID=66136010
... Did you find anything strange?

ID=66136011
As you did, I will teach you if I understand something.

ID=66136012
... understood. I will be waiting so please come and go.

ID=16148001
Oh, I see you again.

ID=16148002
Why am I here?\nIt is natural that there are mercenaries in places where you can make money.

ID=16148003
In addition, the rewards given by the Star Forest Alliance for this job are quite expensive.\nIt's just that I was just right for me who was on the verge of unemployment as Ned retreated from the western part of Crow Dream.

ID=16148004
For now it is supposed to belong to Ned.\nMy surrounding eyes hurt ... Well, thank you.

ID=16148005
By the way ... I am bad early, but I have something to ask.

ID=16148006
It was good until I caught a big money and made a contract ...\nI do not think that there are so many Vesi and soul junk in the blank.

ID=16148007
Besides, I was planning to receive just the fighting fee properly and it seems that it was a long-term contract.\nThe stall forest 's guys are just waiting for me to work until I die.

ID=16148008
Well, there is no reason that such a convenient story will fall down to Ned's mercenaries in the first place.\nI am short of confirmation.

ID=16148009
Once you have been hired as a mercenary you can do your job well.\nIf you abandon the contract here and escape, your career as a mercenary will end even if your life is safe.

ID=16148010
Of course, I do not mean to throw away my life.\nAt home there are both a wife and a daughter waiting for me to return.

ID=16148011
So, it is a suggestion ...\nWill you with a different abilities go ahead to the blank beforehand and reduce the number of enemies?

ID=16148012
Of course, I will give you the share of the contract money I got.\nIt's not a bad story, is it?

ID=56148001
... what? Is that okay with that extent?\nYou are too tender, will you lose someday?

ID=56148002
Or are you still a child so are there money gaps?\n... I'm welcomed, but you are still a strange guy who has different powers of you Starry Forest Alliance.

ID=56148003
Too doubt ... I am wondering what I am working under the Brutal Stary Forest Alliance.

ID=56148004
Anyway, the goal is this guy. It really helps.

ID=26148001
Please handle the goal. ask.

ID=46148001
There was a report from the mercenary group. It seems that it processed well.

ID=46148002
You saved the lives of dozens of soldiers. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

ID=36148001
Of course, keep it secret that you handled it instead.\nThis is a contract between us. Did you understand?

ID=16158001
I am pleased to see you again!

ID=16158002
Since you helped me before, I worked steadily.\nHow about getting used to the geography of this neighborhood. It seems that big help is no longer necessary.

ID=16158003
... By the way.\nOne, will you listen to personal requests?

ID=16158004
Among the jobs we have undertaken by mercenaries is the task of preventing civilians from arbitrarily entering the blank space.\nAnything ... I longed for a different person, I heard that he is doing so to become a different person.

ID=16158005
Thanks to that, we are shifting in front of the day and night blanks.\nMercenaries are said to be miscellaneous, but would be many times better than to lose their lives on the battlefield.

ID=16158006
I was preoccupied by myself while at work.\nI stand stately at a place where civilians can not approach even if they want to get close.

ID=16158007
Why do not you want to get all the things you can get there?\nWhat you can get there, that is ...

ID=16158008
Yes, that is "disparate ability".

ID=16158009
I have heard it. Those who entered the blank can get a different abilities?

ID=16158010
But ... apparently it is meaningless to just enter.\nIt is an embarrassing story, I practiced secretly whether I could not get a flame from my hand at midnight.\nUnfortunately there were no results.

ID=16158011
So, you are a different person You do not know what?\nEven trivial hints are fine. Tell me if you know something.

ID=16158012
... Oh, I said that I do not know anything in the blanks.\nReally ...

ID=16158013
Then ... I would like to investigate things I got from the monsters that are over there.\nWhat possibilities may be hidden?

ID=16158014
It may be an impossible story, but I still want to try it.\nIf you have a mission, bring home the bought items.

ID=56158001
I came, thank you! Of course let's also pay rewards. Of course, it's a contract.

ID=56158002
Oh, please keep secret to others that I received such a request from me.\nIf you ask me from here and there, you will have trouble.

ID=26158001
Oh, please keep secret to others that I received such a request from me.\nIf you ask me from here and there, you will have trouble.

ID=46158001
I brought it. You have been saved.

ID=46158002
Do you want to ask what you are planning to use?\nThat's right, if you put it on the bedside when you go to bed, does not it have any effect?

ID=36158001
I understand myself as being stupid. Still I would like to try it.\nI was really saved.

ID=16168001
Looks like. It is an item you brought before ...\n... apparently seems to have no effect.

ID=16168002
It is still a problem that information is missing.\nHowever, I do not think that I can get information from others ...

ID=16168003
... No, just one person has a clue.\nI wonder there is a stile forest communication department over there? The name is surely Betty.\nI feel like I was saying that I am good at gathering information ... Can you please talk to him?

ID=56168001
I thank you! I will do the information fee correspondingly if I go well this time.

ID=26168001
I will do the information fee correspondingly if I go well this time.

ID=66168001
Today is the best gossip daily! Hey, Betty!\nFor what purpose did you visit? Interview with the news program?

ID=66168002
Give me the information I know?\nHuh, such ... Do not tell me that you should not forget me, are not you?

ID=66168003
% PCFirstName% may exchange transactions with useful information If you have conditions you can think about dealing!

ID=66168004
Oh, oh! What? Really good! What?\nI want to dream of being able to hear information of soul worker from himself!

ID=66168005
I will have to respond to the deal with all my heart.\nNow, what do you want to ask me? I will teach you anything except 3 size and weight!

ID=66168006
... Clues about how to become a different person?\nA long time ago, why do you want foreigners to know such things?

ID=66168007
I want to know why I became it.\nCertainly, if you are losing your memory you may well be worried.

ID=66168008
Well ... Actually there are lots of gossips about it ... honestly, there is no credible information at the moment. You do not mind having the same level of confidence as you treat cancer with folk remedies.

ID=66168009
Among them, the gossip I thought was plausible ...\nGet rid of the monsters that will emerge around the vision and eat that loot! Is it about?

ID=66168010
There seems to be some people who have tried it already, but I heard that they are meaningless if they are weak monsters.\nYou will need to have at least a loot per Jack the King.

ID=66168011
But ... at the time of fighting against such a strong monster, it is difficult if it is not already a different person.\nThe Star Forest Coalition thoroughly prevents booty goods from circulating to the general public, and I think that it is difficult for non-competitors to try it.

ID=66168012
I have about this information. If you find it useful, keep playing a lot!

ID=96168001
You got back. What about the information?

ID=96168002
Eat loot you got from monster ...?\nI certainly know that there are some of them who tried it.\nWhen I ate it, it was nothing but a vision, and it disappeared in the body after a few days.

ID=96168003
However, it seems worth trying out if there is a stronger monster ... opponent.\nIf you have the loot you can divide for me.

ID=46168001
This ... certainly, it is clearly different from what we got from these small fish ...

ID=36168001
If I eat this I will also be a different person ...\n... No, it is still too early for that. Anyway it was saved.

ID=16178001
% PCFirstName%! It is serious!\nA certain idiple seems to have taken the soldier alone and headed for the back of the enemy team!

ID=16178002
It may be that he tried suicide by lamenting his own circumstances being blanked out ...\nChi, I forgot to mention that it is not only me who is treated as a tool.

ID=16178003
I asked the Star Forest Alliance for relief, but there was no reason to arrange for mercenary support.\nWell then,% PCFirstName% will not go searching for that stupidity?

ID=56178001
I sincerely thank you.\nAn example of a stupid name is "Ralph." He jumped out near the subway.

ID=26178001
Do not increase your work when you are busy like this ...!\nThat's why I objected to employing mercenaries!

ID=66178001
Oh, I'm sorry to bother coming ...

ID=66178002
I tried eating what you brought before but it has no effect.\nI tried to find out any other methods ...

ID=66178003
Cut ...! The scar is deep and it is hard to talk.\nIt is bad, but the continuation will do after returning ...!

ID=46178001
... It was a bad thing to bother.\nIt is not enough to lower your head any number of times.

ID=46178002
The Star Forest Association also said that by seeing this situation it will prohibit further entry into the battlefield.\nIt is troubling for mercenaries.

ID=46178003
... You have to tell me.\nWhy did I do this ...

ID=46178004
Actually ... One of the mercenary fellows has a guy who awoke to a different ability since he came here.\nIt was a story I wanted to dream for me who wanted to become a different person and had been searching for clues all the time.

ID=46178005
He was a stranger from the formation during the mission and he was lost in the streethead.\nIn the situation where both feet and left arm were cut into the monsters, only life was barely saved.

ID=46178006
He was certainly using a foreign capability with one remaining arm.\nIt was about the extent to produce a slight light on the palm of your hand, but that light was hope for me.

ID=46178007
So I also jumped into the battlefield just as he did.\nAlthough I was confident of coming home ... This zama is suffering from the crisis of life in the gap of a moment I guarded.

ID=46178008
Perhaps it was true that he was dead.\nI prayed for all of this world, not just God. I do not want to die, please help me.

ID=46178009
... Then, what do you think happened?

ID=46178010
(Ralph put out his hand, a small wind seems to have happened on the palm of your hand)

ID=46178011
I was getting into it ... to a different person.

ID=46178012
Although I can only raise things like breeze yet ...\nStill, I got this power on me.

ID=46178013
It seems that this power is expressed in those who experienced the "life crisis".\nEven in ancient stories, will hear stories often heroes wake up before the crisis and wiped out enemies ...?

ID=46178014
Haha ... Anyway I will keep this power hidden in Starry Forest.\nYou also keep a secret.

ID=36178001
You are a benefactor of my life.\nSomeday this power will strengthen ... I will certainly help you.

ID=16188001
Oh, hello there! %username%!\nI have something I'd like to ask a little, but I have time?

ID=16188002
Actually, Mr. Ralph has suffered a seizure.\nFor that treatment it seems necessary to have items that are difficult to get a bit ...

ID=16188003
It seems like fragments dropped by a tremendously strong vision ....\nI do not understand well well, but it is certain that it is necessary.

ID=16188004
Anyway, Mr. Ralph who has suffered a seizure is calling for it loudly.\nDoes it really have a therapeutic effect on things that disguise the monster?

ID=16188005
There is only about%username% that you can ask for such a thing?\nShould I ask ... Is it no good?

ID=56188001
Thank you! If you get the debris, give it directly to Mr. Ralph.

ID=26188001
If you get the debris, give it directly to Mr. Ralph. I understood?

ID=46188001
Ah ... um ...

ID=46188002
I came. By the way, I feel like I'm getting used to a bit about talking to you ...\n... Is it just me?

ID=46188003
Is it ... a phantom spoof booty! What? That's too powerful ...!\nask! Can you give it to me?

ID=36188001
Ha ha ha! Thank you! Let's ...!

ID=36188002
If you get this again hand it over to me! We always return grace!\nReally ... Thank you ...!

ID=16198001
Well ... ... somehow ... Betty ...

ID=16198002
Why do you look so tired ...?\nI was scolded by Mr. Amanda a while ago ...

ID=16198003
A little! Listen to me about the story!\nReally, I really regret it!

ID=16198004
Listen to me! What? S is%username%!\nA frustrating story is ...

ID=16198005
... ....\nNo one has heard it, is it?

ID=16198006
This is because the other person is%username%! Listen carefully.

ID=16198007
There was communication from a person who seemed to be a blank survivor.\nThe name is "RERPENNE".

ID=16198008
Actually ... When I was manipulating frequencies during boring work, it was communication that I could check by chance.\nI expected so much expecting that I could find survivors!

ID=16198009
And yet ...! I tried to tell it to Amanda, there was no communication record left!\nI can not help it because it is a communication that happens to be connected in a state where wireless devices are not in service.

ID=16198010
There is no way that Amanda believes me ... I got really terrible eyes.\nWow ... I would like to interview blank survivors on a one-on-one basis! !

ID=16198011
There is only%username% already believed.\nCan not you investigate further in my place?

ID=56198001
I came! After all this is a survivor ...!\nI can not pinpoint the point of communication accurately, but I know the direction! This ... ... where Rapid Flame appeared ...?

ID=56198002
Betty ...! As it appears to be moving sneakily ...\nYou were also scattering such a hoax?

ID=56198003
Gouge, Amanda ...!

ID=56198004
Call "superior". I was promoted for the blank investigation.

ID=56198005
In Ruin Fortress I forgave myself, but here I will follow me.\nEven if it seems like this, it is the captain of a communication troop.

ID=56198006
Okay, okay, okay ...

ID=56198007
Huh ...%username%, ignore that child.\nIt is a fraudulent rumor that will usurp people.

ID=26198001
... Are you going secretly? You guys are not you?

ID=46198001
Welcome back! How? I found something like that! What?

ID=46198002
What? There was nothing ...?\nHahaha ... Is that so right?

ID=36198001
Funny ... There is no such thing ...\nSurely I should have received communication ...

ID=16208001
Wow ~ ... eyes that seems not to trust that ...\nI definitely do not have a lie! Absolutely!

ID=16208002
Speaking of which ... There was a story saying that due to the densely populated energy there is radio interference. If you break the Flame Launcher collecting energy, you may be able to communicate again ...

ID=16208003
... Hey, really please.\nBecause it is for the life of survivors who may be somewhere now!

ID=56208001
Thank you! You ought to know something next time if you clear up the flame launcher.\nI asked!

ID=26208001
Believe me, thinking I was deceived!\n... Well, did you believe that you were deceived, do not you believe it?

ID=46208001
Ah! You came in a nice place!\nFloof, you can finally give a new gossip to%username%!

ID=46208002
Suddenly what?\nThanks to%username% working well you can communicate again with survivors!

ID=46208003
I do not disclose to anyone like this if my usual policy ...\nThis time it was done thanks to%username%, so I will tell you the contents in particular!

ID=36208001
... Jijiji

ID=36208002
... Jijiji

ID=36208003
Here ... Ji Ji ...

ID=36208004
Lel ...

ID=36208005
Gigi ... Penne ... Ji.

ID=36208006
......

ID=36208007
... Is it only this?\nYes, that's it.

ID=36208008
I heard only the word "relpenne" ... but communication is still a communication.\nThere is no doubt that someone exists as a transmission source!

ID=16218001
No ... but it is also true that this alone is useless for surveying ...\nI wish I could receive more clear communication ...

ID=16218002
... Ah! By the way, there is a signal receiver just brought in yesterday!\nUnauthorized use is prohibited, but this is not a scoop ...! To protect the survivors' side!

ID=16218003
Well ... I think I'm really sorry.\nBut once again ... would you please listen to my request?

ID=56218001
Thank you very much! There is no other than%username% who can do this.\nAs a matter of fact, it is better to have more personal connections ♪

ID=56218002
Well then I'll ask you to install a signal transmitter!\nInstead I will share with you all the information I get!

ID=26218001
Just a little more! Lend power for survivors!

ID=46218001
%username%! You installed the transmitter safely!\nHow do you know? I was able to receive beautiful and clear communication this time!

ID=46218002
The feeling I wanted to check at that time when I got a message was Yamayama ...! !\nBecause you got information available thanks to%username%, I was waiting for it to come back!

ID=46218003
It is my sign of gratitude!\nIn the first place, sharing scoop articles in this way is so special!

ID=46218004
Well then, do not waste this much.\nShall I check the contents of communication together?

ID=46218005
That's it. I will tell you earlier, but it is impossible to send a voice from us.\nIt is a communication that one has left unilaterally, so it is hard to analyze the contents.\nI wonder if it is like a dying message of a living person?

ID=36218001
...

ID=36218002
This is ... LEL ... Penn.\n... can you hear me ...

ID=36218003
Sounds ... I can hear it!\nAt minimum, it seems that there is no doubt that it is a human voice.

ID=36218004
I do not know who you are.\nWere you came to rescue us or just a swallowed victim ...

ID=36218005
For whatever reason, you are ...

ID=36218006
You must understand yourself that you entered the great blank-like o ...!

ID=36218007
... Great ... Do you like blank?

ID=36218008
Oh ... human being helpless and evil existence ...\nWe survive under the mercy that we gave from the blank, and die for the whimsy whom the blank appears.\nAnd with that desire greedy blood and gradually invade the body ... gradually control the brain, the spirit, and the limbs.\nA merciful blank that saves us from the pain of thought and gives life like a beast ...

ID=36218009
Those who spin the eternal history ... Because you also entered the sacred territory, you must obey the faith to the blank like-minded will. Leave those who ruler not to be merely rampant mad Many blanks lead us to a moderate desire. Last night I filled my hunger with the flesh of a foolish follower. The day before yesterday I moistened my throat. The souls of rude intruders will heal in the night tomorrow morning.

ID=36218010
嗚 Call blank ... like blank like like blank ... like blank like ... 嗚 call blank like ... 嗚 call blank like ... 嗚 call blank like ... 嗚 call blank like ... 嗚 blank like ... 嗚call blank like ... __ ___ ___ BLOOD ___ BLOOD ___ BLOOD ___ BLOOD ___ ___ ___ 0 Dear ... 嗚 Call blank ...

ID=36218011
When a rude intruder enters our realm ... I will promise to thank them for filling the hunger and appreciating the blessings gained from the blank ...

ID=36218012
Gigi

ID=36218013
......

ID=36218014
This ... It is kind of creepy ...

ID=36218015
Well ...

ID=36218016
Sorry, this is ... well ...\n... Can you make me think for a while?

ID=16228001
Hey,%username%. Are you keen on working as usual?

ID=16228002
When you look at the figure of%username% who bothers to come to such a place and have no time to rest,\nI think of myself as a young man.\nI was always fascinated by kicking my head off the head of the police every day.

ID=16228003
... No way, do you think%username% in the same way?

ID=16228004
Haha, I will be glad if you deny it here.\nI do not want to be hated by soul workers.

ID=16228005
... I do not want to be hated, but I have personal dependence from me.\nWill you listen to the story?

ID=16228006
The story of this time is about Vechi of Rapid Flame which appeared as soon as we entered the blank.\nDid you hear from Mr. Tenebris? It is unusual for Vesi to launch an attack.

ID=16228007
Things that have already ended, but that word will get caught ...\nThe intuition as the former research team leader is still alive. Absolutely there is something.

ID=16228008
But ... to be honest, there is nothing I can do alone.\nDo it face to face with Vesi during the investigation, it is finished dead as it is.

ID=16228009
Please ask the Star Forest, do not say anything ruthless.\nHow can a terminal commander like myself procure additional troops?\nIf you tell me to investigate, that old people will oppose my plan by insisting on wasting talent.\nWe have to investigate coherently.

ID=16228010
So ... it's a really sorry story ...

ID=56228001
As you can see, it is too early to notice.\nI will also ask for the peace of mankind.

ID=56228002
Anything is OK. Go pick up where Vesi was and pick up everything you can pick up.\nWe will undertake investigation and judgment.

ID=26228001
Anything is OK. Go pick up where Vesi was and pick up everything you can pick up.\nWe will undertake investigation and judgment.

ID=46228001
Did you go there? Have you got any useful information?

ID=46228002
Is it a book that Hellbringer had ...\nLet's see a little. The content is ... a memoir of his own writing! What? This is going to be good information!

ID=36228001
We will undertake a summary of the survey and results at us.\nIt is good to expect from the fact that it will finish all before coming next.

ID=16238001
Oh,%username%! You came a lot. Just finished decoding Vesi's memoirs.

ID=16238002
It seems that the author liked esoteric expression, and it was terrible at the time of deciphering.\nHowever ... When I finish my analysis, everything I mention is about an ordinary diary book\nIt was content that was nothing. In fact, there was no meaning of analysis.

ID=16238003
Even so, I knew only one thing. They have special mission in Rapid Flame,\nIt seems that he visited here intentionally. To see that the word "instruction of the great one" is frequently used,\nIt seems obvious that their boss 'Purrema' is involved.

ID=16238004
From physical evidence, including Tempest, that Vesi here is an external Rapid Flame\nIt was predicted. What I want to know the most is "why" they came here.\nThere will be some hints if they are systematically moving.

ID=16238005
Will you go over again? If this time is also not good ... let's give up on the survey once.

ID=56238001
Thank you. I will ask for the next one.

ID=26238001
"Great one" ... it is evidence that Vesus' s loyalty is changing to faith.

ID=46238001
I came! This time it's a document ...\nIt is considerable harvest! It will be much more useful than that memoir that was difficult to analyze!

ID=46238002
I got the information back home ... No, I do not need that.\nIf it is about this material you will be able to analyze immediately in this place.

ID=36238001
......

ID=36238002
Whether it's possible to introduce Tempest into the blank in the future ...\nTempest who received assistance from Ned Company wrote that the exam was successful ...

ID=36238003
Looking at the books, it seems that there has been a mutual exchange for at least a year ago.\nThat means that the guys of Ned Company still forsaken humanity ... one year ago?

ID=36238004
Although it was only recently that free and open spaces were released, why was Tempest in the blanks a year ago ...?\n... No, because the machine has no memory, can you send it out freely? I could not think of this ...

ID=36238005
If Tempest's energy collecting ability is able to absorb it certainly it can absorb the energy inside the blank and let it be released to the outside ...\n... Certainly, it's a simple and efficient way.

ID=16248001
In the past we could only gather information like content that reconfirmed the movements they had done. You ought to have hid more information, but you must feel like you are missing out in regret.

ID=16248002
... It is the last time with this. Can you ask for confirmation again?

ID=56248001
My intuition as the team leader of my research team is still alive. Absolutely there is something.

ID=26248001
I will not ask you any more. Only this time, please ask.

ID=46248001
I got a new document again! well done!\nLet's see once.

ID=46248002
Hmm ... this is not new content, it seems we do not have the information we want ...\nIt is not described about internal problems of Rapid Flame.

ID=46248003
The treacher escaped from Rapid Flame and took a hand with a human, there was a considerable blow to the fighting power.\nA previous example that Vesi helps human beings has already been confirmed. It's not a big deal.

ID=46248004
But ... It is not bad information that a traitor has appeared on Rapid Flame with strong loyalty to Pullema.\nAt the very least, the cohesiveness of the Vesi is not completely indispensable.

ID=36248001
Anyway thanks to you for your good work. Let's do the survey so far.

ID=16258001
I am happy to see you again,%username%.\nAs usual it seems like a light in a turbulent history.

ID=16258002
The history of heroes is not only flat roads.\nDue to the illusion of a girl, it can not be denied what was on the verge of falling into the bottom of the dark.

ID=16258003
So, I have prepared some challenges to help you in the future.

ID=16258004
This trial may be a painful experience for you.\nStill have the preparedness to receive a trial?

ID=56258001
Your preparedness is transmitted deep within my heart.\nNext to the place where vision that tempts you is present, please show how much your will is.

ID=56258002
Fruits are fruit on withering flowers. Momentary depravity is a sign of endless difficulty.\nThe pain you are feeling now should be a big light someday.

ID=26258001
Fruits are fruit on withering flowers ... The fall of time is a precursor of endless difficulty.

ID=46258001
Unlike before, I felt calm and fighting with the past afterimages.\nI was also relieved to see a little upset.

ID=36258001
But the trials given to you are not over.\nIf you have the courage to walk towards the future, please come over to me one day some day.

ID=16268001
%username%, you came.\nThere are still a lot of your challenges.

ID=16268002
Please challenge yourself the next time to try not to be defeated by your own thoughts.\nIt may be a painful experience than before ... but you ought to be okay.

ID=56268001
I can not see a point of cloudiness at your resolution.\nThere will be bright and bright hope waiting at the end of the way forward.

ID=56268002
Even in this form of not being able to see anything, you can feel it entirely in the fact that the way you are walking is the right history.\nI hope that history will not endure the poor desire.

ID=26268001
Fruits are fruit on withering flowers ... The fall of time is a precursor of endless difficulty.

ID=46268001
It is not easy to keep facing ugly people.\nIt will be more difficult if it is a person who uses the power of emotion.

ID=46268002
I was able to know even how much you prepared me with my heart.\nLet's impose on you a real trial that I have hesitated so far.

ID=36268001
I pray that your future will always lead to a correct history.

ID=16278001
%username% ... I am delighted.\nDid you visit me in order to challenge the last trial?

ID=16278002
The next challenge will be hardships that psychic pain erodes the body.\nI warned.<fontcolor='#FF0000'>I will undermine your soul and body.<fontcolor='#FFFFFF'>

ID=16278003
Even if you turn away from this ordeal, you have nothing to disapprove.

ID=16278004
Now you can escape from this trial.\nYour soul has already tolerated the trial enough. The only remaining road is pain.

ID=16278005
Still you ... Are you trying this challenge?

ID=56278001
... I am mourning that another pathetic soul can not be relieved.\nBut when you have finished this trial ... the strength you can not express in words will envelop you.

ID=56278002
Now, let's evaluate your time, your patience, and your life.

ID=26278001
Hehe ... ... the escape is always open.

ID=46278001
......

ID=46278002
Frankly speaking. Is not that child anymore special to you anymore?

ID=46278003
No ... For those who have overcome their trauma many times, this word can only be a wound.

ID=46278004
This is ... it was not even in Rosscar's plan.\nPerhaps it may be that you can become an unexpected presence as well.

ID=46278005
... No, it makes no sense to apply such words to you who is the most important axis in his plan.

ID=46278006
Huh ... I did not seem to be able to conceal embarrassment.\nThis time it's your victory. Embrace the honorable emptiness in your heart and let us leave this place.

ID=36278001
But ... Next time a bigger ordeal will stand before you.\nPlease be careful.

ID=16288001
Those who will be free there! Is not it going to talk to me a bit?

ID=16288002
Ha ha ha! Seeing again and again ... is it a face?\nPlease give up! I need you in the fight of everyone.

ID=16288003
By the way ... did you fight with Vesi as soon as you came here?\nAccording to what I heard it seems that the machine also appeared together with Tempest.

ID=16288004
I want to ask a single thing, but ...\n... Are the parts of the damaged Tempest recovered by the Star Forest Alliance?

ID=16288005
Oh! Is it really true to leave it alone? What?\nThat's a nice talk!

ID=16288006
It is the best talk for engineers that the finest parts condensed with the technology of Ned Campaign are left untreated! From ultra-high-tech parts you can get with free!

ID=16288007
That part ... Are you sure you can not get it anyway?

ID=56288001
Good work today! If you do not have to pay anything, I will ask you to do it!

ID=26288001
Are not you available yet?\nAll right! I can wait as much!

ID=46288001
Huh! You brought me!\nIt looks like there seems to be some scratches, but ... there is no problem if this degree!

ID=36288001
Ha ha ha! Ss that was saved!\nIf you help me like this in the future, the quality of our products will rise all the time!

ID=16298001
Wow ... I am a communication soldier ... Even though they are communication troops ...!

ID=16298002
Oh,%username%! Listen!\nEven though I am just a communication soldier, I do not think it is a terrible story to put a wire in the middle of the battlefield and prepare a communication network! What?

ID=16298003
Although I was playing because wireless equipment is not ready for doing things ...\nYou do not have to prepare using equipment you never used!

ID=16298004
Besides, I do not want you to think that just communication troops can fight! Hmm!

ID=16298005
Uh ... I wish I could go to such a dangerous place by myself and have to lay the line dignifiedly ... I'm dreadfully ...\nCan anyone help me work?

ID=56298001
Wow, really! What? I did not mean to say that so ... really! There was not!\n%username%, Thank you!

ID=26298001
You seem to have not finished yet? Good luck with just a little more!

ID=46298001
I received a report that the safety of the site was secured!\nAfter all it is a friend of justice who can not leave people in trouble! I am deeply impressed!

ID=36298001
Please help me if I have to sortie again!\nThere are many things that I can not do alone by myself.

ID=16308001
......

ID=16308002
Oh, sorry. I figured out and did not notice it.\nWhat's wrong?

ID=16308003
Did you feel that my expression is dark?\nAhaha, did you bring any work? ... I do not think so.

ID=16308004
... You are right.\nAs you can see, the condition is not very good these days. There are various reasons, but ...

ID=16308005
Recently, I have not slept well.\nI heard a voice that someone called me in my dream for a long time, my nerves got tangled up.

ID=16308006
Curse of deceased Hicks ...?\nNo, that's not the case. It was a completely different voice from him.

ID=16308007
Anyway with bad fatigue ...\nEven before this I took a vacation and I was absent for a few days at Loco Town, but I could not feel any tiredness at all.

ID=16308008
It became possible to hear the voice after%username% fought on the subway.\nI do not know well, but I wonder if there is anything to do with it ...

ID=56308001
Let's try to eliminate the illusion that may be the cause ...?\nI thought about that, but I have no grounds.

ID=56308002
... Still, now you have to believe it.\nI want to pick away that voice calling me every night soon ... Please.

ID=26308001
Please do not forget ... recently this is a tough one.

ID=46308001
Welcome back. Good job.

ID=36308001
The body ... There is no change like this.\nSorry to keep trying hard though.

ID=16318001
Recently it sounds not only in dreams but also during work and just standing.\nI am already going mad ...

ID=16318002
I do not hear anything else who is seeing it ... Is it because of my extraordinary ability?

ID=16318003
After becoming a different person, you can hear lots of sounds.\nOf course wireless communication, as well as bat ultrasound if concentrating a little ...

ID=16318004
Really ... for the first time such a bad voice.

ID=16318005
... I'm sorry. I am tired, so ... I will have a little rest today.

ID=56318001
Anyway, I'm sorry for taking trouble this time.\nI will be happy if you can help me with something again.

ID=56318002
Huh ...? Will it reduce the number of vision a little more ...?\nNo, the need to do that for me ...

ID=56318003
... Clearly it might be a meaningless effort, right?

ID=26318001
Next time I see something again please, please.

ID=46318001
%username%!\nYou are looking for Amanda, are not you? Here!

ID=46318002
Actually ... Amanda has collapsed while working on communication.\nI am taking a rest at the barracks of Fortune troops now.

ID=46318003
Anyway, that's a strange story.\nI do not have any special hard work these days, although I did not seem to be busy ... suddenly I fell down.

ID=46318004
Oh,%username%?\nDid you mean to visit me?

ID=46318005
Oh, already! Do not get up yet! Please stay a little more.

ID=46318006
No, it is not a problem to solve just because I am absent.

ID=46318007
It should not be said that fatigue is the cause ...\nThere are jobs that I have to handle in a hurry so I will do it ...! What?

ID=46318008
... Amanda! Is it really okay! What?

ID=46318009
Huh ... I'm sorry, I was sweet.\nYou still need a little rest ...

ID=36318001
Yeah, please rest safely now.

ID=16328001
Strange. I think that sudden physical disorders are accompanied by some kind of cause ...\nIn the case of Amanda, it is just being attacked by symptoms and I can not confirm any physical problems at all.

ID=16328002
How I saw it looks like I'm about to collapse right now, but when I check my body I can not find any problems. Indeed, there is nothing like feeling the threat of life.

ID=16328003
I wonder if there is any way ...?\nI can not do anything to people in such a state ...

ID=16328004
%username%, I will do whatever I can.\nIt is unbearable to see the person who suffers like that.

ID=16328005
Well then ... If I go, you can heal the pain of Amanda.

ID=56328001
Ah ... calm down?\nThat's right ... I'm sorry.

ID=56328002
The head seems to be confused somewhat, it is very disgusting ...

ID=56328003
......

ID=26328001
I have to make it alive ... I have to help ... I do not want to die! Please, please ...!

ID=96328001
Oh, you look good.\nWondering why I look like nothing at all?

ID=96328002
I do not know the reason why ...\nSuddenly I returned. Anyway, now I am working without any problems.

ID=96328003
I do not quite understand ... but have you helped%username%?\nThank you very much.

ID=96328004
I will go to the place of Miriam, because I do not care anymore.\nThat girl ... Because the appearance was strange somehow.

ID=46328001
Oh,%username%! Please listen!\nAmanda 's condition recovered and I was able to return to my seat again!

ID=46328002
What did%username% do for you?\nI do not know the details, but you are amazing!

ID=46328003
... Thank you very much. Thanks that, I feel relieved.\nI wonder why I was upset so much ... It looked like it was nothing indeed.

ID=36328001
By the way ... While Amanda was on holiday, there was a strange thing.

ID=36328002
Kant ... ... going.\n... Because now it got better, so one more?

ID=16338001
Huh ... I want to go home ...

ID=16338002
Yeah? Suddenly saying what ...\nAs I said. I can not recall the day when I stepped into my house at the end.

ID=16338003
Every day, watch me work while going back and forth between Ruin Fortress and the blank.\nI did not have enough time to sleep, I wore a futon in a helicopter and cried secretly.

ID=16338004
What sort of punishment do you have to face such a thing?\nThis time there was an order to count the Vesi in the blank with responsibility.\nMy salary is about the tears of a sparrow.

ID=16338005
Even after finishing this work, the next job will come down again ...\nI can not forgive myself for taking a rest.

ID=56338001
what ...? You help me work?\nI did not intend to say it with such a thought ...

ID=56338002
Hey, do not look like that.\nWill%username% always ask for help?\nI thought it was the same this time.

ID=56338003
... Of course, if you would help me say thank you with a heartfelt thank you?

ID=26338001
Originally it was my job to lead ESP. There is no need to push yourself.

ID=46338001
Faaa ...\n... What is it for? There was a sound that the soul worker of justice rescued one worker on the verge of overwork.

ID=36338001
Indeed, it was possible to sleep on the bed even if it was a short time.\nThanks to you. I have to get back to work anymore ...

ID=16348001
Hello. I am running eagerly today, too.\nI think that that attitude that does not change always is wonderful.

ID=16348002
Oh, sorry for stopping you.\nActually, I thought if I could spare a little time ... Would you please give me some time?\nOf course it can not be helped if you are busy ...

ID=16348003
I will tell you, but it's not very special content.\nIf there is time to the last ...

ID=56348001
Thank you ... It is not really a special story,\nSomehow I feel like telling you.

ID=56348002
It is not really a special story.\nIt is just a story of how to call this "glass cover camp".

ID=56348003
... Although I may seem to be a weak person who can not escape from memories of the past,\nIt can not be helped even if you think so.\nActually this is a special place for me.

ID=56348004
This "glass cover camp" is the place where the group centered on me united as a coalition for the first time.\nThere were threats such as Seoul Junk and Desire Energy.\nStill, it was the place where I felt hopes for meeting people who were trustworthy for the first time.

ID=56348005
Glass cover camp is named after one of my close companions\nIt was a light joke that told us to snooze off the lawn as a floor instead of a futon.\nThat has always spread to people.

ID=56348006
But ... there is no lawn like this before and there is only grass that has ended.\nIt would be that Vesi steadfastly trampled while human beings did not visit here ...

ID=56348007
... If possible, could you say%username% to remove this neighborhood Vesi from here?\nOf course, you can use a bit of "brute force".

ID=56348008
A meaningless clash with Vesi is not what I want.\nHowever, it can not be forgiven just to be trampled of memories ...

ID=26348001
Do not push yourself too much.

ID=46348001
Thank you very much. You truly exterminated Vesi.

ID=46348002
It is not a big meaning ... but I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

ID=36348001
... It seems to be okay to trust you for a while.

ID=16358001
Would you please give me some more time to talk?\n... I can not talk about%username% 's past, but ...\nStill, I would like to tell someone about my past story.

ID=16358002
If you think that I am selfish, I can ignore it.\n... If you are interested, please listen.

ID=56358001
Thank you very much. This time to tell%username%\nIt is after the group of survivors centering on me was established.

ID=56358002
When the glass cover camp begins to be known as a base for survivors,\nPeople who were hiding in the surroundings gathered there.\nAmong them were irreplaceable "friends" and a little "traitor".

ID=56358003
The day I took a picture with them is left in my memory as one of my precious memories.\n... I wish I could find the pictures of that time. Would it be impossible as expected?

ID=56358004
... Well, are you looking for me?\nNo matter how much you can find it now after years ...

ID=56358005
... No, here is a place that fulfills the person's "desire".\nRather it is horrible to say that there is a possibility that a wish may come true if you hope to ...

ID=56358006
If it is such a thing, would you mind searching once?\n... Let me talk about my old story as soon as you return.

ID=26358001
Do not push yourself too much ...

ID=46358001
... This picture is!\nWhere on earth did you get it?

ID=46358002
It is difficult to distinguish it with a lot of scratches ... I can surely confirm the face of the road which was my friend.\n... I really can not believe that I can see this picture again.

ID=36358001
Thank you ... I got a unexpected present from you.

ID=16368001
I can not thank you very much about the pictures I got in the past.\nThanks to that, I was able to soak in memories after a long time.

ID=16368002
It was the best gift for me who dreams can not be seen.\nI will thank you again and again.

ID=16368003
So ... as part of a reward, I think that I will talk about my friend in this picture.\nCan you hear me?

ID=56368001
People in this picture are precious friends except "one person".\nAmong them, it was the person who was special with me ... a person named "Lord".

ID=56368002
We were friends and rivals.\nThere was also a thing competing for ridiculous as to which one has a strong sense of justice ...

ID=56368003
Oh ... there are also reen pens in there.\nShe is a woman but she is quite hand-crafted. I was always leading people at the forefront.

ID=56368004
It was about as far as the nickname "Union Saint".\nIt was a person with strong sense of justice who hates the blank that makes people unhappy ... What are you doing now?

ID=56368005
Oh, this is my face ...

ID=56368006
... Iris and Irwin. You seemed better to not write down these two stories.

ID=56368007
... Shall we return to the road talk? Road likes to write sentences, and he always wrote autobiography.\nI was careful not to raise the fervor in those days at that time ...\nNow I just want to read that autobiography.

ID=56368008
It is really a story ...\nIf you look for autobiography on Road like this picture ...

ID=56368009
... No, nothing is realistic anyway ... I'm sorry.\nMiracles can not happen twice.

ID=26368001
... Please do not mind my desire.\nSuch a thing can not easily appear in front of you.

ID=46368001
Is it true that you found a book with the name of the road ...?

ID=46368002
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\nOne thing I hoped for a long time will come true so soon ...

ID=36368001
But ... with such a body, it is painful not to be able to turn over the book's page.\n... There is a meaning in what we can hold in this way.

ID=36368002
Will you let me read it directly ...?\nNo, it seems to be treated like a child with a fluffy ...

ID=36368003
The goodwill of this time is fine around here.\nIf there is a next opportunity, I will consult%username% again.

ID=36368004
... Thank you again for lowering your head.\nNext thank you also.

ID=16378001
Subway and the illusion born within it ... There has also been one more problem.\nI saw a phenomenon that blanks attack people like that for the first time.

ID=16378002
I tried going near the blank for confirmation with this eyes also what happened ...\nI have been disturbed by Desire Energy and vision, and my body can not go deeper beyond that point.

ID=16378003
If there is a place where Desire Energy is strong, this body made of soul spirit\nIt will crumble.\nI really want to check the situation ...%username%, can you help me?

ID=56378001
Thank you very much. If the number of vision decreases, I will be able to expand the range of movement.\nPlease, thank you.

ID=26378001
If I could get out of here ...

ID=46378001
Welcome back. It has been confirmed that I processed the illusion of the subway.\nThanks to that, I also became able to go near that by myself.

ID=46378002
Although I could not penetrate the deep part, I found a figure of a girl who is anxious ...

ID=36378001
Blonde girl with emerald eyes with a little lower back than my chest ...\nThe name is ... The name is ...

ID=36378002
... I do not remember well with old things too much. I'm sorry.

ID=16388001
I'm sorry I can not remember anything while asking for a lot of trouble ...\nIf I can see more visions it seems I can remember something ...\nHowever, it will be rude of you to ask you any further.

ID=56388001
If you let me go far enough ...\nis that true?

ID=56388002
I thank you from the bottom of my heart ... you are stronger and more gentle in places I do not know ....\nI also would like to tell you if I remember about the girl.

ID=56388003
It is my personal story to the last. You do not have to force yourself.

ID=26388001
It is my personal story to the last. You do not have to force yourself.

ID=46388001
Welcome back ... Thank you very much.

ID=46388002
... Huh? A little expression got brighter ...? Haha, maybe so ...\nI intended to stay in constant condition, but I do not seem to be able to hide the true heart.

ID=46388003
The events that happened in the blanks are countless ...\n... I thought of the distant past that I had forgotten.

ID=36388001
It is a little girl named "Catherine".

ID=16398001
The first time I saw that child was ruins where there was no one around here.\nShe lived in hiding alone with 'Desire Worker'.

ID=16398002
He was with Katherine, "Desire Worker" has long been a dangerous one for us.\nThere are fearsome prescriptions that reject humans and curse ... mercilessly take away their lives from those approaching them.

ID=16398003
We saw the appearance of two people and decided that Catherine was taken hostage by a desire worker.\nAnd trying my best to save Katherine ...

ID=16398004
But Catherine ... what to do with "friends"\nWhile holding a grudge I was crying all the time.

ID=16398005
Yes, Katherine and Desiree workers were really living together as friends.\nHowever, we did not believe such a story that we disliked the designer worker more than Vesi,\nThe designer worker himself had already disappeared from the place.

ID=16398006
Catherine is trying to find a desire worker ...\nWithin a day, I became missing in the blank.

ID=16398007
Desire worker who lost Katherine also began to go crazy beyond that by sorrow.\nI struck directly against the survivors of the glass cover camp and issued numerous casualties.

ID=16398008
... We have the last chance to bring back the human mind to the designer workers\nYou may have thrown away yourself.

ID=16398009
That Katherine and%username% meet outside the blank ...\nIndeed, I do not know what will happen.

ID=16398010
Although the ending may have turned towards a bad direction ...

ID=16398011
... This is really the last request.

ID=16398012
Playing with the hearts of people, that disgusting vision ...\nI want you to get rid of it over and over again and again.

ID=16398013
Of course they are not completely disappearing at the time of getting rid of, and the sins of the past do not become light.\nBut I can not let them leave like this.

ID=56398001
Thank you very much.\nThank you for your inconvenience to%username% ... but please.

ID=26398001
I'm sorry for the inconvenience to%username% ... but please.

ID=46398001
... Thank you for your hard work. Thanks to you, I became comfortable for a while.

ID=46398002
Really ... this blank is hateful and can not be helped.\nTrapped people, fiddled like a toy ... in the end to succumb to desire ...

ID=46398003
I do not know for what reason this whitespace appeared or what it exists for purpose.

ID=46398004
But ...%username% and all the people on the earth who are alive ...\nI hope to show strong will, not beat the blank mind.

ID=46398005
... robbing, being betrayed, suffering splitting ... That is what we felt fully spared in the blanks.

ID=36398001
It was truly a hard work,%username%.\n... I bet you will be busy even after this, so I will bother you so far.

ID=36398002
I wish ... I wish you the way to go with blessings.

ID=16408001
Yeah, soul worker! I see you again!

ID=16408002
What? You are wondering what the illegal businessman is like here?\nReally is a terrible fellow! Well, I was also surprised at first.

ID=16408003
I meant that I did not have any dust to come to such a dangerous place ...\nGet a contact from the Starry Forest Alliance.\nDo you want to do better business?

ID=16408004
I do not know how long they know me ...\nIt seemed like a delicious story, so I ordered myself to dispatch to the blank!

ID=16408005
Well, anyway! As I have come anywhere, I want to get treasure again.\nIf soul workers help me a little comfortably will it?

ID=56408001
Thank you Thank you! By the way, I have a question before going into the subject.\nDo you know what shape memory alloy?

ID=56408002
Shape memory alloys are unusual metals that return to their original form even if they change shapes in any way.\nIt is flexible and it is used to make high quality equipment.

ID=56408003
Why do you have such a story?\nActually, fragments of visions that can be obtained around here have properties similar to that.

ID=56408004
I want to get some of it!\nOf course I will prepare the reward. Why did you ask!

ID=26408001
What happened? Are you still unavailable?

ID=46408001
Oh, you brought me! thank you!

ID=36408001
Do not just finish this time alone, you should bring it many times in the future!\nIf you feel like contributing to me again, say it anytime!

ID=16418001
Welcome.\nWell, I have something I want to ask personally today, is not it?

ID=16418002
Oh, thank you ...\nRecently ... a vision appeared around the subway?\nThere are mysterious rumors about that vision circulating.

ID=16418003
When you eat cooked meat made of phantom, when you have a fantastic taste like the word ...

ID=16418004
It is not playful. I am seriously serious!

ID=16418005
Anyway, I'm curious about the rumor and I can not sleep at night lately.\nCould you bring me the visionary meat?

ID=56418001
Are you surely free! What? Do not worry, I am a merchant.\nPlease let me know the price you want, negotiate and deal with reasonable price ...

ID=56418002
... just brought one of the things that was rolling on the ground ...?\nHuh ... ... then, please spare my words ... Thank you.

ID=56418003
Well, then, I'm looking forward to working with you. %username%.

ID=26418001
I need visionary meat. Please do.

ID=66418001
Where is this visionary meat ...

ID=66418002
It certainly has a different color from ordinary meat.\nWhat do you mean, do you feel strange as you see it ...

ID=66418003
This is a delicious meal even if I am ...\n... No, nothing!

ID=66418004
I'm sorry, could you wait for 30 minutes?\nThere are cooking utensils in the car, so I will prepare cooking there.

ID=66418005
For what purpose ...?\nThat idiot ... No, Jite had eaten my dish before,\nIn this case I said that I had better eat tires.

ID=66418006
I do not mind at all for evaluation of such a person!\nBut ... I think everything is terrible. Even though I made it all the way ...

ID=66418007
Wow ... anyway, please wait while watching items.\nCooking is completed soon.

ID=66418008
(You can hear sound of boiling and baking meat)

ID=66418009
Fuu ... Although the name is big, if cooked it will not change from ordinary meat.\nThe best masterpiece was baked. Could you give this to Jight?

ID=66418010
(I obviously received a dangerous object)

ID=66418011
It may be a little magical color, but because it sprinkled a lot of seasonings for seasoning ...\nI am using good meat, so the taste should be delicious.

ID=46418001
Welcoming you! What kind of sauce is it today?

ID=46418002
(I showed black and hard inorganic matter)

ID=46418003
...? What is it, stone fossil?

ID=46418004
... Well, that is cooking! What? And Yomi made it ...

ID=46418005
He ... sometimes I will eat cooking and send strange things.\nPerhaps even today I'm talking about picking a suitable stone and cooking.

ID=46418006
... Still one meal?\nSuch a dark lump, where would you think so?

ID=36418001
I lied to Seoul Worker to make a mischief to me.\nThis must be done to show it to the eyes ...

ID=16428001
Well ... But there is no fun if you take revenge in the same way.\n... How can I make a mischief most effectively?

ID=16428002
That's it! That reminds me there was a thing!

ID=16428003
I heard that soul workers are also talking about the vision that visions are appearing on the subway recently?\nSo I found some interesting minerals!

ID=16428004
No matter how you process that mineral, there is a mysterious nature that returns to a stone-like figure the next day.\nIt is a similar shape to my shape memory alloy.

ID=16428005
I will do it using this point!\nGifted ore like a jewel,\nWhen Youmi who is pleased wakes up the next day ... the jewels are stones! What's it!

ID=16428006
Ha ha ha! Do not you think it is a pretty good idea?\nAnyway, I want you to help me get back to you!

ID=56428001
Ss that was saved!\nMen 's thing, from a spontaneity that can not stay forever! This time I will show things to my eyes!

ID=26428001
Ha ha ha! If you imagine that idiot is a ga-hoon, it's a crescure throb!

ID=66428001
Ssu came! Is this an example mineral?\nHaha, it will surely become beautiful if you polish!

ID=66428002
Wow! The motivation for creation got to rise Morimori!\nCan not you wait for a while? It's easy to process!

ID=66428003
(... a few tens of minutes passed)

ID=66428004
Ha ha ha! The heat has entered more than I thought!\nIt is the first time that I have put this much effort into mischief.

ID=66428005
Well then, I would like you to give this to Yomi.\nI am direct ...? He is likely to make a strange misunderstanding, I hate it.

ID=66428006
I'd like you to ask me to start getting the proper rent from it properly!

ID=96428001
Welcome back. What did Jite say?\nDid you eat my dish?

ID=96428002
You ... did you eat it? Besides, did you receive items of thanks?\nis that true?

ID=96428003
That muscle stupid way to bother to prepare items of thanks ...\nWell, please show me for the time being.

ID=96428004
I, pretty jewel ...!

ID=96428005
Is this really a jite to me?\ncan not believe ...

ID=96428006
... Haha ... I feel like a child, are not you?

ID=96428007
Actually ... I knew I was also.\nThe food I made was not tasty ...

ID=96428008
Although I did not want to acknowledge it and forced it against the jute ...\nYou thought about me and ate it.

ID=96428009
I thought that it was stupid for the rest of my life, but the jite is also growing up ...\nCompared to that I am ...

ID=96428010
I must thank the Jite.\n... Could you tell him that you will make absolutely delicious food next time thanking him?

ID=96428011
That ... that kind of thing, I can not say a lot from myself ...\nThank you!

ID=46428001
Ha ha ha! Is it a stupid of your fault, did you receive it obediently?\nAfter all it 's pretty cool.

ID=46428002
Looking at Yomi who turned his face red as he saw the appearance changed to stone in the morning of tomorrow,\nI'm going to eat and dinner too! Ha ha ha! !

ID=46428003
What? What do you think?\nWhat does it mean?

ID=46428004
(I explained about what Yomi was saying)

ID=46428005
......

ID=46428006
... Was that so?\nI knew that he was wrong ...

ID=46428007
Besides ... It was not stone, was it really seriously cooked?\n... Something that is clumsy for everything will not change a bit.

ID=46428008
That girl who could only count money and arrange items ...

ID=46428009
......

ID=36428001
It looks like urgent business was done.\nI will remove the seat for a while, but please do not stolen goods.

ID=16438001
Huh

ID=16438002
Oh, it's not%username%. I wonder what kind of thing is for today?

ID=16438003
It seems not to be fine ... is it?\nWell, yeah ... it may be as you say.

ID=16438004
Major Benjamin?\nGo to the blanks and say that you get something like that special product.\nNo wonder, I think that is sightseeing spot or something ...

ID=16438005
I was told that anything is good, but what I get for me is nothing special either ...

ID=56438001
Oh, really? Are you bringing usable things?

ID=56438002
I'm really saved!\nI do not care about anything, so I just want you to have only the number. I asked!

ID=26438001
You do not have to force too much!\nBecause I'm just a selfish lieutenant Benjamin.

ID=46438001
This ... is the vision packed full of bottles?\nBeautiful ... I also want it.

ID=36438001
Anyway Thank you!\nWith this, Major Benjamin should be convinced.

ID=16448001
I'm asked by%username% ... Do you mind?

ID=16448002
I want to practice cooking with more visionary flesh in order to clear the previous grief.\nBut, I do not have a means to get the material ...

ID=16448003
I will prepare the appropriate remuneration.\nPlease bring visionary meat.

ID=56448001
Thank you! Thank you.

ID=26448001
I need more meat ... please do.

ID=46448001
Thank you! Please leave the meat here.

ID=36448001
Next time make delicious food, and to the jute ...

ID=36448002
... that? Please, forget it! This is just my own idiom ...!

ID=16458001
How are you? I am running around well today.

ID=16458002
If you have time, will not you talk a little with me?\nIt should be an interesting story for%username%.

ID=16458003
People are excited about curiosity when newly exploiting the undeveloped land.\n... But when you are always doing work that touches money like me all the time, your eyes may look slightly different.

ID=16458004
How about selling unusual items obtained here to outside people?\nI thought so.

ID=16458005
Of course, carrying out goods obtained with blanks is thoroughly prohibited by the Star Forest Alliance.\nAt the most, the commanders involved in this blank case will have brought some items for private reasons.

ID=16458006
Therefore, the merchant association prepared a connection that can carry out a blank item after hardship.\nThe rest are only procurement routes, but ...

ID=16458007
... Will not you cooperate for a while?

ID=56458001
Thank you very much.\nAnything is okay, please bring me lots.

ID=26458001
Anything is OK. Anyhow you can bring as much as you can.

ID=46458001
You brought it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\nLet's guarantee that you will benefit by this time as well.

ID=36458001
I feel like I'm in some way complicit in crime ...?\nDo not worry. We merchant association is doing legal operation to the last.

ID=16468001
Oh,%username%. Although I am busy where I am bad, I can do something important.\nWould you like to come over here?

ID=16468002
It seems that Vesh, who should have killed%username%, appears again.\nWill you lend me the power again for the smooth survey of the Star Forest Alliance?

ID=56468001
I am saved. In order to be willing to receive other competitors in the future\nLet's prepare a separate fee as an additional mission.

ID=26468001
I was saved. Let's prepare this time again as a duty which other interrogatives can receive.

ID=46468001
I confirmed that the sign of Vesi had completely disappeared.\nDo not do your job perfectly ... It is truly.

ID=36468001
Vesi will continue to appear in the future. Ask him to process it when you notice it.

ID=16478001
Fuu ... really ... Oh, it's true ... huh ...

ID=16478002
%username% ...\nI showed a bad part. I'm sorry.

ID=16478003
Really ... it only shows embarrassment, it's embarrassing.\n... But, I have to breathe out with my breath, I feel as if I'm about to go drinking.

ID=16478004
How much does my foreign capability specialize in communication technology ... why do you call my name when you do not have anything?\nDo you know what you called me for in the meantime? Listen to the cat's cry and say that you have to decide whether it is an enemy's communication or not!

ID=16478005
It really seems stupid! You call me because you are afraid of the cat 's barking but not closing?\nIf I do not like it I will be sighing if I get pulled out to such a thing.

ID=16478006
Really ... ... If the soldiers of the communication section come to the blank early, it will be a little better ...\nThe upper part is hesitant to put in troops because the blank is still dangerous.

ID=16478007
... I know I should not make such a private request.\nStill ... please do! I would like you to help the telecommunications section come here before I fall over with overwork!

ID=56478001
Thank you! After all%username% is dependable.

ID=56478002
The reason is that the communication section can not enter the blank because there are still many enemies around here.\nMy boss will definitely change my mind if I reduce that number ... I will depend on you.

ID=26478001
The reason is that the communication section can not enter the blank because there are still many enemies around here.\nMy boss will definitely change my mind if I reduce that number ... I will depend on you.

ID=46478001
Oh,%username% ... Please come over here.

ID=46478002
There is no need to be hard. I just want to ask why I went to the operational area although I had no instructions.

ID=46478003
Amanda is ...? Hmm, is that so?

ID=46478004
Unfortunately, even if%username% kills a few bodies, the communication department will not change.\n... They are afraid that they do not have the courage to break into the blanks.

ID=36478001
... It is a miserable story, but please tell Amanda directly from you.\nIt will sound like a boring excuse for me to tell.

ID=16488001
Thank you for moving towards the operational area for me.\nI hope the communication department will come soon as soon as possible ...

ID=16488002
Huh? Martin tells you?\n... will you tell me?

ID=16488003
......

ID=16488004
Yes ... the communication soldiers are regretful in life?

ID=16488005
I do not ask the order because the battle ability is low ...\nI do not see anything about myself suffering here.

ID=16488006
my mother ...\n... I wonder why, I wonder why I am working here.

ID=16488007
Of course, there is great significance in saving people.\nHowever, still ...

ID=16488008
Oh, were you here?\nAmanda, I have a talk with you.

ID=16488009
Wh ... what are you doing! What?

ID=16488010
Oh my ... this is terrible force.

ID=16488011
... What on earth is it for?

ID=16488012
Haha, do not look at that much.\nI guess I visited this place thinking of giving a rest to your tired Amanda.

ID=16488013
... Huh? Do you have a day off?\nEven though I told you I want you to take a day off, I refused to say that I am not at the moment ...

ID=16488015
Well then ... I can rest a little ...

ID=16488016
That's it. If I can, I would like to send about a comfort trip ...\nThere is possibility also by any chance. Do not leave the blank.

ID=16488017
That's enough.\nUm ... I will sleep a bit with the tent. Leave me alone ...

ID=16488018
Have a nice time to enjoy your valuable vacation.\n...%%username% will you listen to my request?

ID=56488001
... Thank you.

ID=56488002
Even if I hurry, it seems that I will be busy for the time being.\nWe need to work for weak assistants.

ID=56488003
If you want to create a situation that does not require communication ...\nAnyhow there is no choice but to annihilate the enemy.

ID=26488001
I will be busy for the time, but I asked.

ID=46488001
I sincerely thank you.\nSomeday we will prepare a holiday for%username%.

ID=36488001
There is no need to hold back.\nEveryone has the right to take a rest.

ID=16498001
Thanks to%username%, it is true that Amanda's burden has been reduced ...\nIt is obvious that Amanda's job will eventually increase again as long as there are problems that are not prepared for communication.

ID=16498002
Well ... after all it is necessary to solve the fundamental problem.\nWould you lend me a hand for a poor subordinate?

ID=56498001
Thank you. Then, first thought ...\n... It is still wired contact.

ID=56498002
Recently, try to hit crazy soldiers crawling on the ground and laying the line.\nPersistence will be hard for%username% alone, so I will accompany it.

ID=26498001
That radio addiction name is Betty.\nWould you like to visit her together?

ID=66498001
Wow! Up to%username% to Martin!\nWhat are the important people in the blank search for me?

ID=66498002
No, it's not special.\nI just want you to do three times as much work as you do.

ID=66498003
... Martin who says such a story as "not special" is "special".

ID=66498004
It's a bit of a story. It would be fine if you lay a line.

ID=66498005
... I had no intention of informing my superiors directly about dissatisfaction.\nAs you can see, I am wireless addiction! Wireless addiction. I understand?

ID=66498006
Wireless and wired ... whether there is a line, is not it just that difference?

ID=66498007
The difference is the biggest!

ID=66498008
Of course, I know that Colonel Amanda is struggling.\nBut that's why I will take over the thorn's way ...

ID=66498009
How about by accepting close contacts of soul workers?

ID=66498010
Please leave it! ! ! ! !\nI spread a line across the entire blanket and spread it! !

ID=66498011
Really ...? Really really? Seoul workers there are all right! What?

ID=66498012
(I affirmed it for a while)

ID=66498013
Come on! Then I am a motivated man man ♪\nLeave it to me!

ID=66498014
..., I want to say!\nI went to a place where monsters were shrinking at all,\nSorry to have a line on a dumpling.

ID=66498015
Well, that's right.\n%username% needs to be on the front line. Can you ask?

ID=46498001
Thank you.\nFaa ...

ID=46498002
Do not have trouble%username% ...\nBut just do your best a little. I will also make an effort.

ID=36498001
I got tired from working all night with the communication soldiers ...\nHaha, I do not want to get used to it anyway.

ID=16508001
However, there was still progress made surely ...\nEven if Amanda does not exist anymore, I can somehow communicate around here ...

ID=16508002
... Amunda's strength is indispensable when heading to an undeveloped area ... ha ha ha ...

ID=16508003
Hmm ...? Looks somewhat serious this time ...?\nStop it, it is forbidden to think like that.

ID=16508004
... My image that makes troublesome my troubles is to be kept.\nIf a serious image is attached even a little, more work will come from above.

ID=16508005
Even if it is not so, it is a position to be used extensively as a commander's end ...\nIf you work so hard, it is obvious that you will be rolled further like you?

ID=16508006
... But you can not leave your men who are suffering from overwork.

ID=16508007
Haha ... It sounds like a good person. Even though the good people are the only ones to be used ...\nAfter all, I do not think I can still be an adult yet.

ID=16508008
However, it was me who brought Amanda, and I used it a lot.\n... Sometimes you have to do a little extra.

ID=16508009
Oh ... when I was talking about this, my temperature went up.\nLet's say we return to the story of work.

ID=16508010
Communication soldiers clean the neighborhood to lay the line clean.\nPerhaps it will be the last in this time.

ID=56508001
Hello, I beg you.\nAmanda's rest period is over when this work finishes.\nPlease report to her when you are finished.

ID=26508001
Amanda's rest period is over when this work finishes.\nPlease report to her when you are finished.

ID=46508001
......

ID=46508002
I was listening to everything while I was on holiday.\nMartin and%username% laid the communication network around here for me?

ID=36508001
What he is saying ... There is also a good place for him in surprising way.\n... I wish I could show those parts directly to me.

ID=36508002
... Well, even if I do not intend to forgive my sins that brought me here.

ID=16518001
Hey,%username%. Is something left to work now?

ID=16518002
Hehe, there is nothing.\nCome over here, there is a lot of information.

ID=56518001
What kind of information ...? It's about Near Soul Workers.\nUnfortunately it is not that they were discovered.

ID=56518002
Still it may become a clue.\nLet me give you this information if you help me with my work.

ID=56518003
I'd like to ask for the suppression of a dread full echo.\nI'm counting on you.

ID=26518001
I'd like to ask for the suppression of a dread full echo.\nI'm counting on you.

ID=46518001
It's a splendid cleanup this time as well.\nIt's hard work.

ID=36518001
Talking the whole information ...?\nHmm, unfortunately it can not be heard. With this information I have to spend%username% over and over again ... Oh, it is a joke! Do not turn your weapons over here!

ID=16528001
I can not tell you the details yet though ... I will let you know the rough content.\nIt seems that "the reason why the near soul worker disappeared" could be grasped to some extent.

ID=16528002
If you work a little more I will tell you the next information.\nHuhu, do not rush too fast. Information does not escape or disappear.

ID=56528001
Will you be asked me! Well, you are still worried.\nIf so please ask one more time.

ID=26528001
I asked once more.

ID=46528001
I heard that it did perfectly this time as well.\nIt was really hard work.

ID=36528001
Oh, I worked more diligently than I thought.\nI will give you what you want.

ID=16538001
Dr. Sarah, who is studying energy at Ruin Fortress, contacted me.\nAfter the near soul worker disappeared, it seems that I have been investigating the surroundings all the time for concern.

ID=16538002
What is worrisome is the huge energy that appeared after you fought with Zion.\n... Looking back after the reaction sensed by the machine or the craters remaining on the ground ... It is probably not the energy that exists in this world.

ID=16538003
... So far at this point.\nLet me tell you about the rest if I will assist you with my work again.

ID=16538004
Do not look at me with such cold eyes!\nShould transactions be done carefully?

ID=56538001
Haha, this is the last time. I'm begging you.

ID=26538001
Next information ... Do not you want to know?

ID=46538001
It was really bad to bother troubling me.\nBut ... to teach this information with free stuff my work was too late.

ID=46538002
How far did you talk about last time?\nOh ... Did you tell about the existence of energy that seems not to be the thing of this world?

ID=46538003
For one time, I investigated the causality of that energy and sudden disappearance of near soul workers.\nIt seems that it is not necessarily that the children died on the spot.

ID=46538004
... If it says that it disappeared without a trace, the story is different.

ID=46538005
According to Dr. Sarah's survey, fortunately Near soul workers seem to have been kidnapped somewhere.

ID=46538006
It seems that it was blown somewhere by a mighty energy.\n... I still do not know if it is in the blank or somewhere else.

ID=101259
Welcome, Mr.%username%.\nWe have a lot of clothes for you.

ID=101253
Following the near soul worker search, is this anomalous blank ... ... Oh, I want to return.

ID=101254
I could bring you that I can not communicate unless it's my ability ....\nIt is also a thought that it is too competent.

ID=101255
Welcome back%username%!\nPlease take a good rest.

ID=101256
I came earning money. My affiliation is still a neped.

ID=101257
It must be the best gossip here!

ID=101258
......

ID=101260
Why do not you end meaninglessly?\nBecause it will soon disappear.

ID=101261
Damn it ... I got more solid ... ...

ID=101262
......

ID=10213001
Stop dubbing and stop talking straight away.

ID=10675007
Well ... everyone, have fun with people ...\nThat way, I will not be sad!

ID=15901001
There will be nothing I do not know.\nDo whatever, remember!

ID=15901003
I do not mind having a trifle thing!

ID=15901007
If you accuse the hero who prevented the crisis of world destruction any more, punishment is likely to come.\nIt was good that%username% came back alive.

ID=15901008
Where did they go?\nAbel and ... Sion ...

ID=15901013
Is that ... right?\nIt is because of us ... not it?

ID=15901031
Oh, if you can afford it, can you come to me as well?\nI summarized the phenomena that occurred all over the world, so I want to share it.

ID=95901021
In short, there is no human being to help here if you say%username% want to look for near soul workers.\nI will not stop as long as I search for an empty fortress for many days alone.

ID=55911007
Yes ... everyone, both soul workers and soul workers ... everyone says that.

ID=95911004
Near soul worker Sion is various, there are various things, working without sleeping for the pursuit ...\nWhat is next time? Since other incidents have occurred, please give me your best regards.

ID=95941019
... The commander.\nI understand your feelings, but there are reasons why I do not speak to the blank ...

ID=35981002
I'd like to say for not only%username%, but for the safety and life of many people.\nPlease understand.

ID=95991020
I do not understand why, but foreigners and soul workers are basically just good people.\nAlmost all the different persons fight for humanity and work as a member of the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=46001021
Especially if%username% was a desire worker\nAs soon as you can remember the past, you will soon accept the desire.\nAfter all, it is dangerous to go any further.

ID=96091028
Well then! I will stop by a different place!

ID=16101005
I have to answer correctly!\nso! I am an orphan who lost my parents! !

ID=16101006
Oh, that ... I do not know how to respond if I say so dignified ...

I made a little noise, but it is the same to see the place where this space disappears.\nI think I can do my best if I get a little break.

You'd better go see Miriam.

ID=65994017
To be precise, "to crave for power" ... any hatred for people is OK.\nWhen you want a stronger force from your heart, blanks give power to that desire.

ID=65994052
... Whitespace is constantly trying to extract%username% 's desire.\nWhat the blank wishes is "food" that brings out more of his own desire, that is,%username% is the highest quality food.

ID=95994018
I do not understand why, but foreigners and soul workers are basically just good people.\nAlmost all the different persons fight for humanity and work as a member of the Star Forest Alliance.

ID=46004016
Now if%username% is craving for power, it will be consumed by the designer as soon as possible.\nAfter all, it is dangerous to go any further.

ID=46004033
Oh yeah ... others believed that you were a soul worker.

ID=15905032
Oh, if you can afford it, can you come to me as well?\nI summarized the phenomena that occurred all over the world, so I want to share it.

ID=35945001
Thanks to you, you said that you injured and cowards trying to escape from the blank\nIt has become possible to stop it.\nFloof ... ...%username% everyone.

ID=45985019
I know that%username% has sent a much more terrible life than anyone else.\nI can not deny that I have a strong mind and body compared to the same age child.

ID=35985002
I'd like to say for not only%username%, but for the safety and life of many people.\nPlease understand.

ID=15995022
Tene is too worried ...\nBesides, we can not fight strong enemies!

ID=45995004
Fuyo ...! Well then do you know what Tene talked to me?

Near soul worker Sion is various, there are various things, working without sleeping for the pursuit ...\nWhat is next time? Since other incidents have occurred, please give me your best regards.

ID=15926026
To put it well, I have leadership and, if badly said, I was stubborn.\nWhen I acted as a leader, I was constantly conflicting opinions with me as another informal leader.

ID=15926028
No, it is the obligation of the leader to minimize the influence of group opinions.\nAt that time, my qualification as a leader was not enough. That's all.

ID=55926012
If you can confirm it, I will tell you all over the days like past talks.

ID=65976010
Regardless of age and length of association, the way of getting along was biased.\n... I was wondering if the partner is splitting "I do not like it" or "I want to set a distance appropriately".

ID=35986002
I'd like to say for not only%username%, but for the safety and life of many people.\nPlease understand.

ID=45996008
Well then, what kind of story is heard? What do you think of Miriam?\nShall we leave from here?

ID=46006020
Especially, if%username% who was a designer worker can remember a little past, it will accept desire soon.\nAfter all, it is dangerous to go any further.

ID=46478005
As an exception the operators claim that they need to enter as soon as possible ...\nIt is a fact that the danger is absolutely high. In order not to reduce the number of enemies further, I will not be able to issue a rush order.

ID=16488014
It seemed so far, but the number of Vesi stationed in the blank space also decreased, and the survey has been carried out smoothly.\nFor the time being, we will listen carefully and investigate around here will not have big problems.

ID=36538001
Anyway, the information I have is here. As a result, the body of the near soul worker has not been found. It seems that it was blown somewhere by a mighty energy.

ID=36538002
That is why you can rest assured.\nYou do not have to think that you are dead.

ID=36538003
I'm sorry to leave the job a couple of times for information that is not a big change in circumstances.\n... But just know that the investigation to find them is still going on.

ID=26011001
I have worked so hard so far, so please take a good rest. all right?

ID=26031001
Huhu, I'm keen to be enthusiastic but do not fall.

ID=26071001
I ... I'm all right, do not worry ...

ID=26081001
... I'm just watching over here,%username%.

ID=16543001
Oh,%username%, are not you? It was just right!\nThere was something I wanted to ask you for a moment ... ...

ID=16543002
Huh ... you've been doing too much again?

ID=16543003
There is a rude way of seeing people's faces and sighing.

ID=16543004
No, this is lamentless rather than sighing.

ID=16543005
%username% ... When you are tired you can take a break,\nYou should have said so many times?

ID=16543006
I should have answered many times.\nNo break is necessary. Because I will not get tired.

ID=16543007
Oh, you know. I am aware that soul workers do not get tired.\nI have heard it many times before, I do not think I do not understand.

ID=16543008
... So why?\nYou just wanted to complain about me?

ID=16543009
No, that's not it.\nI think that%username% was also asked several times ...

ID=16543010
Soul workers never get tired physical.\nEven so, if you get tired mentally, the effects will come out to the table.

ID=16543011
For%username% ...\nIt seems that the eyes that look like insects usually change like watching trash.

ID=16543012
... Hmm.

ID=16543013
Well, probably the cause is the last battle ...\nIt probably was pretty severe for%username%.

ID=16543014
As usual I just fought against the enemy and won.\nAs we are constantly fighting by betting our lives,\nIt is something that does not matter whether it is tough or not.

ID=16543015
It would not have been bad to die at that time.\nEven if the murderer like me is living long,\nThere is nothing like a good thing, do you?

ID=16543016
Also it?\nSaying something is to say "to die"\n%username% is not a sick person or an old man who was about to die.

ID=16543017
How to treat your own life is not yourself's freedom?

ID=16543018
Ok then, I understand that it is not a problem that other people pinch your mouth.\nHowever, when thinking ethically about "life\\nIt is hard to say that it is a good one.

ID=16543019
ethical?

ID=16543020
When%username% is dead, there are those who grieve?

ID=16543021
... I am not such a person.

ID=16543022
Why do you decide on your own?\nI am here, is not it?

ID=16543023
I do not need your worries.

ID=16543024
Hahaha, it is bitter.\nWell, I never thought I was moved by such a word\nI did not expect it either.

ID=16543025
However, it is better to remember this.\nThose who value%username% more than%username% think\nThere should be plenty.

ID=16543026
I just fought and fought for myself,\nWe just used the ambition to save humanity.\n... There can not be such a person.

ID=16543027
Haha, this does not work.\nYou will see it directly.

ID=16543028
%username%, give a vacation now.\nReturn to the crowdream and meet the people I've helped so far.

ID=16543029
How many times do you understand?\nI do not need a vacation.

ID=16543030
......

ID=16543031
To be honest, I have no idea what will happen in the future.\nHowever, I can only see that%username% is upset in the last battle.

ID=16543032
So I will ask seriously this time.\nDo not push yourself, rest now slowly.

ID=16543033
So, I ...

ID=16543034
I'm begging you,%username%.

ID=16543035
....

ID=56543001
... Hmm.\nIt can not be helped. Well, this time I will ask you a favor.

ID=56543002
As usual, as long as you ask seriously it will be serious whether you listen properly ....\nI was pretty cold even though I was really kind.

ID=56543003
I will withdraw the previous word.\nNo vacation is necessary after all.

ID=56543004
Well, it is never the case to cancel what you said once?

ID=56543005
... That.\nIf so, I will not return to this place any more,\nWould you please disregard me any more?

ID=56543006
Oh, that's a problem. I am in trouble%username% ....\nUm ...%username%?

ID=26543001
Be careful,%username%.\nYou do not have to worry about these things.

ID=66543001
%username%, it's been a while ago!\nI heard that you are on vacation from Martin.\nHow have you been?

ID=66543002
If it means that you are sending a meaningful life. Yes.\nWas Benjamin san's safe too?

ID=66543003
Oh, of course.\nIt has been without any problems since you removed the threat of Loco Town.

ID=66543004
Speaking of thought, although the doll that Edgar left behind is still about to attack it often ...\nAs a miscellaneous soldier who lost command, it does not lead to a big threat.

ID=66543005
Even if it is a miscellaneous, it will be like killing time.\nWhenever you need it, please call me anytime.

ID=66543006
I do not recommend it much.\nEven if we defeat a doll that can be knocked down by the power of Fortune troops unilaterally ...

ID=66543007
It can not be relied on care. My interest is in the act of killing,\nIt is not what I want to fight against a strong opponent.\nIf it is more fun than crushing insects, whatever you do is OK?

ID=66543008
Hmm ... that homicide demon character still as usual.

ID=66543009
It's not a character ... it's a character!\nI sincerely hope to die in battle ...

ID=66543010
Ah. When you left Rocotown, I thought that it was the same.\n... But now it is not.

ID=66543011
You rescued a lot of people and fought for a lot of people.\nEven if you deny that you are different, everyone would think so.

ID=66543012
I do not know how you are evaluating yourself ...\n%username%, you are definitely not a bad person.

ID=66543013
I just did as I wanted.\nThere is no reason to be evaluated by others, such as being a bad guy and being a good person.

ID=66543014
It is stubborn as ever.\nWhatever I say, have ears to hear?

ID=66543015
Anyway, for a while let's have a holiday in Locotown.\nSometimes I need a day off.

ID=66543016
... I will rest properly and return.

ID=66543017
Haha, do it your way.\nThat's right, can you meet Ryew once?\nI was listening to various things whether you were concerned about you.

ID=66543018
Oh, is that rude man?\nI thought that it is not even worth having a greeting to him.

ID=66543019
I heard that I am hated, so much ...?\nWell, it is only certain that Ryu is concerned about you anyway,\nPlease manage to manage there.

ID=66543020
......

ID=46543001
I came.\nI heard that you visited Loco Town, I was waiting.

ID=46543002
If it is really "waiting\\nIs not it a gentleman to come to pick me up?

ID=46543003
The speech with thorns is as ever.\nI am glad when I heard it after a long time.

ID=46543004
So, what have you been up to now?\nAlthough he seems to have experienced various things quite a lot in the story heard,\nWill you let me hear from your mouth?

ID=46543005
Although it seems to make a big misunderstanding,\nI did not come here for tea with you.\nI came to scold the rude manner of rewarding people by using others.

ID=46543006
...... I think it sounds like an excuse, but as long as it is entrusted to maintain the security of Locotown,\nYou can not move from here during working hours.

ID=46543007
If so, you should review the behavior a bit more.\nLook at the face of the person I met for the first time in a while and say "I should have came" with a word that is nothing.

ID=46543008
I am sorry.\nBecause of this character ... I am not good at caring.

ID=46543009
I got a conclusion.\nIt means that I and Ryu do not match fundamentally.\nEven if I go home already?

ID=36543001
No, it can not be heard.\nI still have something to say to you.

ID=36543002
... ... It is inconveniently inconvenient and inflexible.

ID=36543003
There is nothing we have to do now anyway,\nI will listen and talk about the story.

ID=36543004
Oh ... I appreciate it.\nLet me not talk too long.

ID=16553001
First of all, when I look at your face I notice myself.\nI think that it is rude but I want you to say frankly.

ID=16553002
I'm looking forward to seeing how rudeness is to be done.\nDid it get dark? Are you thirsty for blood? Looks like that?

ID=16553003
... Such a childish thing, children would not say that.

ID=16553004
...... I do not think she is childish but ...

ID=16553005
Anyway, it is different from what I said.\nThere are many things I want to say, but in summary ...\nThat's right.

ID=16553006
Was it a lot more human being than before ...?

ID=16553007
That way of saying ... It sounds as if I were not a human being until now.\nIt's very rude.

ID=16553008
Yes ... the word itself being "rude" in this word is a major change.\nIf you were an ancient person you would have told me "Do not be offended because it is a fact."

ID=16553009
... Is it a hobby to analyze people like greatness?

ID=16553010
No ... I think that I am at ease now.\nI thought it was a very serious problem when I first talked to you in Loco Town.

ID=16553011
About the story of enjoying your slaughter, it seems that it was in vain to the eyes of others ....\nIt looked like I was saying seriously to my eyes.

ID=16553012
I know how human eyes can enjoy seeing oppressing the weak by force.\nI have also seen and learned many things.

ID=16553013
Yes. As you said, I experienced a lot of things and changed from a long ago.\nNo matter how much I am unlike you are not rude.

ID=16553014
Still, only the nature of enjoying killings did not change.\nIt is troubled if you are misunderstood that you regained sin and became a good person.

ID=16553015
... Of course, I do not expect you to be on the side of justice.

ID=16553016
Just a little ... so. It's not just another person, even my own ...\nI thought if I would learn the importance of life.

ID=16553017
I've been trampling a lot of lives other than human beings\nDo you think that it is a suitable word?

ID=16553018
... If you think so, there is nothing I can talk about from me any more.\nBut I think if you think a little about my words during this vacation.

ID=16553019
Is that the puffy saying the importance of life?\nDo not bother to express yourself, so be sure to erase it in your head cleanly.

ID=16553020
It is useless to say anything if you start stretching your homogeneous spirit.\nI will not speak any more.\nIf you do not do anything else, you can treat meals as much as possible ...

ID=16553021
Why do not you invite me for a meal once you have looked back over the past actions?\nI consulted for a way to eliminate the stress I received from you\nI will return to Benjamin.

ID=56553001
I see ... I got it.\nIt would be a short time, but still want some time to spare in mind.

ID=56553002
It will only be a boring time.\n... It is something that puts the mind together and returns to the blank immediately.

ID=26553001
Do not push yourself too much.

ID=66553001
here we go!\nDo you have anything you want so you can enjoy it properly?

ID=66553002
Mission ... Is the holiday already over?\nWhy are you in such a bad mood?

ID=66553003
I did not need vacation from the beginning.\nWorse if I'm in a bad ... Anyway, can you give me a duty now?\nI do not care whatever I want to do.

ID=66553004
I do not know what happened, but it seems certain that I met Ryu.\nI felt that I declared that I would not meet ...

ID=66553005
It is noisy!\nShould I have told you that I would definitely do a mission?

ID=66553006
Oh ... I got it.\nJust a job came in ... Is it really okay?

ID=66553007
Yes. Now I can do anything, so I need to relieve stress.\nRather, I am angry if it's a boring job.

ID=66553008
That's good. There is oneself that you will not get bored.\n... More than anything, it is related to abnormal whites.

ID=66553009
Oh, it's a blank story that it appeared throughout Crow Dream.

ID=66553010
Recently, more energetic energy has begun to be observed from the whitespace that existed before.\n... It is not anyone else You were observing at the same time you came to Loco Town\nI was concerned.

ID=66553011
I thought that you would not ask for it because you officially have a vacation ...\nTo tell the truth, I wonder if you have something to do with what you have come to Loco Town.

ID=66553012
I can also take care of leaving things that I know dangerous ...\nI'm counting on you.

ID=66553013
It does not matter.\nIt is more meaningful for me to go than people who are not going to die in vain.

ID=66553014
all right.\nBut, if you are in danger, please come back soon.

ID=66553015
There is no need for useless worries.\nIf it dies, that is it.

ID=66553016
... You are worried because you seriously say such a thing.

ID=46553001
I returned.\nAlthough it was not as expected,\nStill it was about stress relief.

ID=46553002
Oh, welcome back. It was a hard time.\nWas there something unusual inside?

ID=36553001
It is not noticeable, but I found one eerie thing.

ID=36553002
It seems like a source of energy that you sensed in advance.\nLet me see it in detail.

ID=16563001
This energy ... just looking makes my eyes hurt. What on earth are you?

ID=16563002
Is it such a surprising thing?\nIn my eyes it looks like something fragments.

ID=16563003
No, rather rather familiar ...\nJust like the voice I heard before ...

ID=16563004
If you do not mind, can you give the fragments to the Star Forest?\nPerhaps there is a key to uncover blank secrets ...

ID=16563005
I'm sorry, I will refuse the offer.

ID=16563006
Mum ... Is there a reason for not giving up?

ID=16563007
I can not explain well with words, but ...\nI feel somewhat similar to myself from this piece.

ID=16563008
Frankly speaking, I do not know what to do with this ...\nStill, I think that this fragment exists for me.

ID=16563009
Do you say that you leave it to me for such ambiguous reasons?\n%username% ... You seem to have forgotten where you belong.

ID=16563010
..., it is natural as a commander to say.\nOur Fortune troops trust you in full.\nThere is no doubt about your decision.

ID=16563011
It is a wise judgment.\nAs a matter of fact, I did not feel like giving up,\nI would like to withhold meaningless arguments.

ID=16563012
Oh, there is one thing I would like to ask.\nWhenever you need help, always Fortune unit ... and ask me.

ID=16563013
I would like to express my gratitude for your kindness.\nBut I will investigate this fragment with my own hand.

ID=56563001
Do not push too hard.\n%username%, do not forget that you are not alone.

ID=56563002
Please tell your children such lines.

ID=56563003
You are still a "child".\nBut if you really do not like it, let's turn it into words you like.

ID=56563004
Your life is no longer yours alone.\nDo not let it be spared anywhere, so do not spend it empty.

ID=56563005
...?\nNo matter how I use my life,\nI think that there is nothing to do with the Star Forest people ...?

ID=56563006
I enjoy killing and killing everything like this ...\nIf you fight properly and die, that is fine.

ID=56563007
As I have reason to judge myself as not normal,\nYou are a respectable person too.\nYou are not a mad dog brought to a battle field.

ID=56563008
Well, the little saying will start again.\nI will excuse you because I do not need to stay longer any longer.

ID=56563009
... I understood.\nIf there is a next opportunity, let's talk again at that time.

ID=26563001
I guess I can only watch over it.\nTherefore, I will watch over your back from now on.

ID=66563001
%username% ... Can you come here?

ID=66563002
What is your weak presence?

ID=66563003
You should have acquired things that lead to a mighty power.\nIt is an item deserving part of the strata that constitutes your history.

ID=66563004
I do not know whether it is power or stratum, but if it is available recently this is not it.\n... Do you know something about this piece?

ID=66563005
That piece of debris you found in the blank,\nIt is full of malice named desire ...\nIf you use this chip you will come to a place where your essence will wait.

ID=66563006
So I have to ask before you face your ugly figure.\n%username%, Are you sure it's okay?

ID=66563007
I am ugly whoever looks at anything.\nThere is nothing to panicking at what I saw any further.

ID=66563008
The courage from ignorance is brave.\nTo make judgments on the basis of what does not have opposed\nIt is nothing but arrogance.

ID=66563009
But ... arrogant, savage. Both can be prepared for one thing.\nThere is no reason for me to shut your way.

ID=66563010
There are too many unnecessary words.\nI do not need a futile story anymore, I wonder if I will teach you as soon as there is a way.

ID=66563011
Now, let's pour the extent of creating space in the debris of your little evil.\nPlease call on me if you are ready.

ID=66563012
... You do things that are frustrating.

ID=96563001
You seem to be ready.\nIf you put this piece at the nearest point of the mind, you can reach "her".

ID=96563002
Putting it closest to the heart?

ID=96563003
It is the brain that is responsible for thinking, but it is the heart that makes up the mind.\nIf you hold your eyes close to your chest and close your eyes it will be easy to reach.

ID=96563004
... I understand.

ID=96563005
May your way of walking lead to a correct history.

ID=46563001
This ... Is this black shadow yourself?

ID=46563002
This seems to have caused an unexpected customer as well.\nI would like to serve sweets and tea,\nI can only stand up and talk about where there is nothing like this.

ID=46563003
You say what you do not have in your mind.

ID=46563004
There is not such a thing.

ID=46563005
Because I and you are the same person,\nI judged that thinking is the same.

ID=46563006
Hehe, it is.\nI and you are the same human beings.\nIt was just divided into two.

ID=46563007
And yet ...\nWhy are you still having patience?

ID=46563008
I have patience ... What is it?

ID=46563009
It's about crazy sleep within you.

ID=46563010
You ought to be able to release as much as you now ...?\nPeople who believe in you ... children who believe it is safe, old people who want peace,\nAre not they all pretentious prey?

ID=46563011
Even so, you are caught in a worthless sense of justice and are pressing yourself down.\nYour patience is not good for your body or mind, right?

ID=46563012
You say "Even human beings can kill them all"\nIt is a thought.

ID=46563013
Now ... let's discard boring rules for protecting humans.\nIt is best to spend time for myself?\nDo not think about anything, keep on feeling ... just let your mouth thirst go ...!

ID=46563014
Leave that body to their own madness, kill everything and die.\nIs not that much more nice than suppressing yourself by being held captive by the birthless sense of justice?

ID=46563015
......

ID=46563016
It is a face that does not agree with me.\nI will be happy to hear any objections.

ID=46563017
No, I was just amazed.

ID=46563018
Were I like this in the past?

ID=46563019
... It has been poisoned by a worthless other person, 'imposter'.

ID=46563020
Hmm, there is no body, but the mouth alone is an expert.

ID=46563021
Is not it much better than a faithful dog who is obedient to human words?

ID=46563022
For someone? For mankind?\nSuch a silly excuse is not necessary.\nIt is fun to kill and there is no value in what we have thrown away.

ID=46563023
It seems to me that I remember the pleasures of killing,\nI can not understand why you stick to the reasons for killing.\n... probably due to memory loss ...\nEven so, I do not think it will change so much.

ID=46563024
Would you please return it if you do not intend to use that body properly?\nI will use it for my worth being more valuable.

ID=46563025
Hmm ...

ID=46563026
After all you are my shameful stain.\nIn my eyes, I just hope to play\nI only see it as a child.

ID=46563027
Because it is a fact, I will not deny it.\nStill, do not you think it is better than a dog connected to a chain?

ID=46563028
Thinking, you can kill alone as many as you worry ...\nAs a nobility to overrun a foolish thing, as a monster caught up in madness.

ID=46563029
Despite being a nobleman, are not you thinking that it is strange?\nIt is uncomfortable that I was supposed to nod in such words.

ID=46563030
Do not you understand even if you say so far?\nThen return home from here right now.\nEven if I exchange words any more, I just waste time with each other.

ID=46563031
I already lost the way to rob your body by yourself,\nI can not interfere with anything from here.\nSo forget about me completely and live forever.

ID=46563032
Hmm, the more I speak, the more time I wasted.\nWell, let's go home now.\n... but I will come back someday.

ID=46563033
... It is also an unexpected answer.\nYou ought to have disappeared without feeling while you were leaving.

ID=46563034
I talked with you a bit earlier, but please try to talk again this time\nI understand that the words do not communicate with each other.\nBut, in my heart there is something like you\nIt just makes me uncomfortable.

ID=46563035
That is the way that it treats me as if it treats it like a pathogen,\nIt's very uncomfortable, is not it?

ID=46563036
I made up my mind to settle with you in whatever form.\nI could not find the answer this time ...\nStill, someday I can convince you in my way.

ID=46563037
Huh ... Can you convince me?\nAlthough it stains in the blood, there is no beautiful thing than the life scattered vividly.

ID=46563038
Originally aristocrat proceeded with believing, not looking back on the past.\nDespite showing off herself enjoying and acting as she wants,\nThere is nothing to worry about others' eyes.

ID=46563039
You are nothing but an impostor born for loss of memory,\nIs it possible to present different answers?

ID=46563040
Please wait and please calmly.\nUntil the pouring tea cools down,\nYou still have plenty of time left?

ID=46563041
I do not want to spend more tea time any more ...\nWell, it is probably the last game before quietly sleeping\nI will wait for you.

ID=46563042
... Because I will reclaim all their attitudes\nWait a while.

ID=66573001
%username% ...!\nWhere on earth ...?

ID=66573002
I just chatted with someone with some acquaintance.\nSomething wrong?

ID=66573003
No, it is not so ... nothing so suddenly appeared from the empty space.\nI've been living and have seen various things,\nI was a little surprised this time.

ID=66573004
Is this also related to abnormal white space?\nOtherwise, is it the debris that brought this before ...?

ID=66573005
I do not want to have a troublesome explanation,\nIt is not a big deal.

ID=66573006
If survey is necessary, you will also need a request from the Star Forest Alliance.\nIf there is a surplus, call the survey team ...

ID=66573007
No, I am grateful for your thoughtfulness, but this time\nI am about individuals.\nCould you please disregard me?

ID=66573008
Is it that you do not need help?\nIf you say that you do not want to involve other people ...

ID=66573009
As a sister fighting involving a national institution,\nIt is only that it is exaggerated.

ID=66573010
I see ... I guess what it is but it can not be helped.\nBut whenever I get something to help you say.\nIt is impossible for me to keep drinking like this.

ID=66573011
Then, about the abnormal space where a mighty power is felt like this time,\nCould you tell me if there are other occurrences?\nThat shard which I picked up before might be necessary again.

ID=66573012
If it is an empty blank, it should have occurred throughout the crowdream.\nIf you are near, you can go to Candus to find a tip\nIt may be obtained.

ID=66573013
Well then, I will go to Kandusity once.\n... I also wanted to investigate the situation over there a bit.

ID=66573014
Oh, I understand. Let's not report this time to the top.\nAs safe to go to Candas,%username%.

ID=96573001
I am happy to see you,%username%. Welcome to Kandusity.

ID=96573002
It's been a while ago. I asked a bit about personal things.

ID=96573003
Personal things ...? Although it was said that the report came as a vacation ...

ID=96573004
Yes. Because it is extremely personal thing,\nThere is no difference in terms of getting a vacation.

ID=96573005
Oh, I see ...\nThere was something I wanted to ask you, but that can not be helped ...

ID=96573006
Worry is useless, if you are not prolonged it will help you.\nEspecially if you want to kill something, I would rather hope.

ID=96573007
Are you sure ...?\nIf so, soul junk treatment mission is preparing for another occasion ...\n... It is about the corporate block first.

ID=96573008
A large amount of soul junk was discovered in the river area on the outskirts of Candas,\nI insist on being unable to send a troops corps.\nWill you be able to listen to your words, will you persuade her?

ID=96573009
... It seems that you are getting exhausted at that time.

ID=96573010
Of course, I understand that Corporal Block has a deep wound to my heart.\nBut if so, it can not abandon the responsibility for protecting the land.

ID=96573011
Yes. I will talk about it.

ID=96573012
I'm counting on you. In this way, Kandusity\nI will be drunk again in Seoul Junk.

ID=46573001
I have not seen you for a long time, Mr. Block of an arrogant strategy soldier.

ID=46573002
...%username% ...\nWell ... well ... long time ...

ID=36573001
I had predicted, but I am completely exhausted.\nAaron is supposed to worry.

ID=36573002
Colonel Aaron ... ...?\n... Oh, this before.

ID=16583001
If the story I heard is true, you confront the superior officer\nI am rejecting orders.\nAre you planning on raising a coup at last?

ID=16583002
I do not think so!\nDo not know anything Do not speak as if you understood it!

ID=16583003
Hmm.\nThen how about trying out legitimate excuses?

ID=16583004
......

ID=16583005
It's just a remote area just soul junk is boiling.\nIt will not attack Kandas city from such a distant place,\nEven if I sent a soldier I just died of a dog.

ID=16583006
In that case, so to speak frankly\nI think that I can finish a useless question and answer?

ID=16583007
Do you think you did not tell it? Since I first spoke, I explained that it is dangerous and meaningless plan.\nBut Aaron had no ear to hear.\nThere is soul junk there so do not leave it without annihilation ... just that was it.

ID=16583008
I do not care about where the soldiers got dissatisfied,\nRather it is punishing the repelling soldiers.\n... It's like a tyrant who thinks nothing after the war but just war.

ID=16583009
... Mr. Victor did not do anything?

ID=16583010
Victor is the same.\nHe is developing dangerous weapons following the annihilation of Colonel Aaron's soul junk.

ID=16583011
Before this, the area where JVC indiscriminately used radioactive weapons\nIt was isolated as a danger zone as it was.\nYet, he seemed satisfied to be able to kill soul junk a lot.

ID=16583012
What the hell am I doing ...?\nHow do we all fight to protect people like the old days ...?

ID=16583013
There is nothing in the eyes of people once caught up with revenge.\n... From me, I can not give you a satisfying reply.

ID=16583014
That's right.\nSoul worker is not a super hero who can do anything.\nThe relationship between people is a strategy soldier ...\nNo, I've been fighting forever and I have to solve it.

ID=16583015
But, I am not confident ...\nI can only save a soldier who is being driven to a strategy to waste his life, little by little.

ID=16583016
A few seconds ago I found out that soldiers were secretly excluded from the strategy list\nI just received disciplinary action.\n... I have no idea what to do ...

ID=16583017
... If Catherine were to be found, so much miserable and strategic soldiers served,\nI guess I was getting angry ... hahaha.

ID=16583018
How long are you going to drag the past?\nPlease help yourself.\nThere is only you in the city right now.

ID=16583019
How come you ...\nHow can you live as if you had nothing?

ID=16583020
I have something else to do.\nAt one point I was excited like Aaron ... but now it is not so.

ID=16583021
I thought that ... Katherine's friend,\nI forgot it more beautifully than I thought.

ID=16583022
No ... Normally you can forget such like this ...?\nOr was only Catherine thought that he was a friend?

ID=16583023
Catherine something was not worth anything for you\n... Do not you think like that?

ID=16583024
... Do not say such a thing in a joke.

ID=16583025
No ... there is no possibility ...\nFrom the beginning Anta was crazy about just killing something ...!

ID=16583026
After all Catherine was a toy for you ...!\nI killed it with proper reason to kill ... I guess so! What?

ID=16583027
...... I will advise only one thing.

ID=16583028
It is not to put out any more selfish guess anymore.\nBecause I wanted to kill you from my heart now.

ID=16583029
......

ID=16583030
It's an eye that you will not yield.\nWould be nice. I will head to another place for a while.\nPlease cool a little ahead by the time it comes back.

ID=56583001
No, you are the one who has to cool his head.\nI have not said anything wrong.

ID=56583002
Indeed, you feel pity only.

ID=26583001
I told you to go, why will not you go ...?

ID=66583001
Ha ha ha,%username%! It's been a long time sincere!\nI have been waiting long for you as to when you will come!

ID=66583002
Do not be surprised when you hear ... This me developed Napalm which can burn soul junk!\nEven the surrounding forests are damaged by a tremendous flame,\nI can not resist Seoul Junk if it is not it!

ID=66583003
How about you,%username%! Do not you think it is amazing?

ID=66583004
Long time no see, Victor.\nIt seems that it has changed considerably from what it was before, as you have heard.

ID=66583005
Before killing Soul Junk in the past,\nI think that it was not such a feeling of pleasure.

ID=66583006
Of course, my former servant and I am a different person too!\nI woke up to the mission of doing true justice and survival of mankind!

ID=66583007
Soul junk has to annihilate ...\nFor children born from now,\nWe have to fight at the expense of everything.

ID=66583008
Of course I am no exception ...\nI will continue my research as an atonement to the mistake I made until I fall asleep.

ID=66583009
Sacrifice humans to protect humans ...\nDo you think that this contradiction is not something to laugh at?

ID=66583010
No ... If you hesitate for sacrifice they get even stronger.\nWe must build a foundation in order for the future people to survive.

ID=66583011
Ha ... it seems you are completely drunk with your own ideas.\nWhatever you say, you do not think you will stick to your theory and understand other words.

ID=66583012
Because the requesting two are like this, that cheeky strategy soldier\nI am crying, I guess.

ID=66583013
Will you help me if you have time if%username% too?\nSeoul Junk of course that is killed and is well-known is still gushing up.

ID=66583014
%username% may just enjoy it,\nIs the purpose of killing Seoul Junk the same?

ID=66583015
I do not feel appealing to that proposal at all.\nRather, it is very unpleasant.

ID=66583016
Huh ...? Why do you say such a thing?\n%username% likes fighting so much ...

ID=66583017
I will keep it down so I can not say anything to others.\n... One thing I can say is that I like people like you\nI wonder if it is okay not to have done.

ID=66583018
What does that mean ...

ID=66583019
Why do not you think about using a little head?\nAnd please also be aware that many people are suffering for you like that.

ID=66583020
Well then, by this I will.\nBecause I may talk to that cheeky strategy soldier.

ID=66583021
Eh,%username% ...? %username%!\n... Huh.

ID=46583001
What ... Why did you come over?

ID=46583002
Because I've seen more serious people than you.\nYou can also nod your getting caught up by the paranoia with this.

ID=46583003
Oh ... I've met Victor ...\n... He has changed completely.\nYou'd better think that it is a different person than before.

ID=46583004
No, it is natural that people will change if there is such a thing.\nI wish had never had any harm to others.

ID=46583005
Then ... a little, I also understood Block's feelings.\nIn such a situation, it would be that myself, who speaks with a light feeling, looked cruel.

ID=46583006
... It is fresh for you to understand the position of others.

ID=46583007
It is not inappropriate as a word to put on someone trying to understand ...?

ID=46583008
Oh, sorry ....\n... And I also apologize for the matters of a little while ago.

ID=36583001
As you said calmly, as you said, it seems to be overstated.\n... I'm sorry.

ID=16593001
Either way, you still remember the solution is not remembered ...\nAt best it's Sekiyama trying not to get the situation worse ... Ha ha ...

ID=16593002
Why do not you stop forselfing yourself?\nStill, it is better to strive to improve the situation,\nIt is better than people who are optimistic about the situation and leave it alone.

ID=16593003
... So, how about you?

ID=16593004
Of course I do not doubt it looks like a while ago ...\n... What influence Katherine's death had on you\nOr ... I want to know what was wrong.

ID=16593005
... Of course it may be mere curiosity ...\nStill, if you fought with Catherine\nI am afraid to say I do not know what you are thinking ...

ID=16593006
... honestly seems to have fallen into human distrust.\nWhen you see everyone around you burning with anger,\nRather it is calm I began to doubt that I might be strange ...

ID=16593007
... It seems that I was struggling quite a while while I was away.

ID=16593008
So ... I think I'm bad, but I will listen again ...\nCatherine for you ... what kind of existence was it?

ID=16593009
Well ... Frankly speaking, I can not answer right away.\nStill, what Katherine was for me,\nBecause the idea is not gathered.

ID=16593010
Still it is certain ...\nI was the act of killing something the first time that day\nI felt discomfort.

ID=16593011
It is an enemy opposing me and to protect humans.\nDespite being a battle that fulfilled these two conditions.\nIf it's usual, in a battle that meets this condition\nThere is no reason to feel uncomfortable.

ID=16593012
However, no matter how much time passes, that discomfort will not disappear any more.\nLike the remnants staying on one side burned ...\nIt remains distinct as it is annoying.

ID=16593013
... Rather, if I could mourn for Katherine's gone,\nThis discomfort will surely have disappeared.

ID=16593014
I guess that was an important thing to you ...\nYou can trust that you have that much heart ...

ID=16593015
I will not deny.

ID=16593016
... That's enough.

ID=16593017
Colonel Aaron and Victor have become monsters ...\nIf you were in the same state to you ...\nPerhaps, I think I can not bear it.

ID=16593018
When I first met you I thought it was a monstery but a monster ...\nRight now, it's a "person" who can be more reliable than anyone else.

ID=16593019
People ... That's right ...\nI am not a monster unknowingly ...

ID=16593020
I am asking for miserable attendance, but please be sure to come back to help Kandas city someday.\nIt's the worst situation I can not turn back,\nIf you are here, I feel like I can manage it.

ID=16593021
... I will think about it when I can afford it.

ID=16593022
Thank you! I'll bear with it until that time.\nTry to hold down the violence of Aaron and Victor as much as possible.

ID=16593023
Huhu, can you survive this situation?

ID=16593024
It is not about waiting as compared to when there was no hope.\nSo be sure ...

ID=16593025
... A little wait, the contact came.\nThis number is Colonel Aaron ...

ID=16593026
It looks like you are looking for%username%.\nI also plan to do something unreasonable.\nIf I do not like you, I will report not being here.

ID=16593027
My concern is unnecessary.\nEven if impossible but impossible I will only move forward ...\nIf it was not possible indeed it would only die.

ID=16593028
... You can not understand that way of thinking\nAnyway, I will talk to you there.

ID=56593001
I do not know when it will be, but I will definitely come back.\n... Please accept that until that time.

ID=56593002
O.K. I understand.

ID=26593001
Okay ... still can bear ...

ID=66593001
Finally came. How's it possible to persuade a block a little?

ID=66593002
That's right ...\nI had plans to progress the situation as it was.\nPerhaps it would be better to wait a while.

ID=66593003
Is it so ...?\nIf nothing else you say, believe and wait ...

ID=66593004
Well, that's it. This time I had you call me with other matters.\nI will take away my vacation ... I wonder if you can help me?

ID=66593005
That's what I want.\nUnable to solve the unit of the Star Forest Alliance,\nEven the mighty forces appeared?

ID=66593006
Oh, were you listening to it in advance? As you said.\nA powerful force suddenly appeared that I have never seen before.

ID=66593007
... apparently it came time to come.

ID=66593008
That involves my "personal matter".\nIf you only tell me where it is occurring, I will process it as soon as possible.

ID=66593009
It seems to already be known.\nIs there something you are looking for?

ID=66593010
Yeah ... I will use it to go asking one "fools" one question.

ID=66593011
Hmm ... I do not know what the story is about, but it seems like a personal thing\nLet's not ask any more.\nI will do whatever it takes to neutralize even the threats that appeared in front of me.

ID=66593012
I appreciate compassion and I will go there soon.

ID=46593001
You seem to have returned home safely.\nThe strong energy that was observed was not perceived any more.\nCan you tell me what happened?

ID=46593002
I just enjoyed it properly.\nI guess energy has naturally disappeared.

ID=46593003
(... I'm sorry, I hide things about debris.

ID=36593001
Anyway it's a relief. Thank you so much for your help.\nI wonder if the schedule for the future is decided?\nHopefully block it again ...

ID=36593002
No, because I have something to do personally.\nI will go now.

ID=16603001
That's right, regret but there is no reason to hold you forever.\nLet's persuade the block from me.

ID=16603002
Although I make a mistake on who I have to persuade ...

ID=16603003
Yup ...? Did you say something?

ID=16603004
Because I am alone, I do not care.

ID=56603001
Ah. I do not know what your personal thing is, but I pray for good fight.

ID=26603001
I pray for a good fight.

ID=66603001
I brought a different fragment again ...%username%.\nWould you like to step into your world again?

ID=66603002
Sorry to trouble you, but again please.\nI grabbed the chest and I wanted to hear it.

ID=66603003
There is no reason to refuse.\nGive the small crystals you have the power to create space.\nPlease talk to me again after a while. It is good?

ID=66603004
... I do not want you to wait too long.

ID=96603001
Sorry to keep you waiting.\nIf you place this piece closest to your heart,\nYou can reach "her".

ID=96603002
It is the same method as last time, I understood.

ID=96603003
But ... is it really okay?\nYour energy ... history ... everything is swaying greatly.

ID=96603004
I am ready to watch it as awaiting the wave of history.\n... But I can not be sure that the waves lead us to the right path.

ID=96603005
Do you like to make words difficult?\nI may die if I step further,\nThat's about it?

ID=96603006
It is a worthless life prepared in the past such as death etc.\nOnly things that are not timid rather than others are advantages.

ID=96603007
understood.\n... I also believe in your preparedness once more.

ID=46603001
Hmm, Heroes who protect humanity are coming to such a place again,\nI guess it is free.

ID=46603002
To protect humankind is just a reasonable reason.\nI just did what I wanted to do.

ID=46603003
As usual, the mouth are the ones who talk.\nSo what did you come for this time?\nBoth black tea and sweets ... There is not even a chair to sit on.

ID=46603004
Because I did not come looking forward to tea time,\nIt does not seem to be a concern.

ID=46603005
As long as you hear the unpleasantly delirious voice,\nI do not seem to have been looking forward to tea time.\nSo, what kind of quarrels were you selling so far?

ID=46603006
I have a question for you.

ID=46603007
Please say it.\nI am confident in world history and English.

ID=46603008
It is not content that needs knowledge.\nWould you like to say "academics\

ID=46603009
Are you ...%username% · Do you think Bloom Malchen is "human"?

ID=46603010
Huhu ... If you think why hesitate words,\nIt's a shitty question than I thought.

ID=46603011
It is "a monster". Of course?

ID=46603012
... Oh, that's right.\nIt is the same as the old one ....

ID=46603013
The same chunk of meat as chopping every day everyday ...\nOnly the strong man will survive.

ID=46603014
At first I thought that I was such a existence.\nThen, I did not think about anything, I just wanted to fight as he was led.

ID=46603015
Oh ...? I hear that if it is such a grumble that it is no longer a monster.

ID=46603016
Before answering that question ... Do you mind my second question?

ID=46603017
I mind that being able to lead a conversation a little,\nLet me listen.

ID=46603018
You feel guilty when you kill something\nHave you regretted it?

ID=46603019
Of course, I have never had it!\nWhat is different from you.

ID=46603020
The source of the power that we have is not other "madness" ...\nI admit that it is a monster,\nWhy do you need to feel guilty?

ID=46603021
Being killed and killed is just play!\nIf you are weak you will not be able to play ... So you can be strong indefinitely!\nMadness that I want to play forever, I crave more power!

ID=46603022
I see, I understand well.

ID=46603023
Really! Then you must understand that you are a monster!\nFor those who do not think about anything and only want fighting, the designation of monster is suitable!

ID=46603024
So kill more, kill, kill and become like me ...!

ID=46603025
I'm sorry, but I can not do that.

ID=46603026
Can not ...? Why is it so.

ID=46603027
I am far from monsters,\nIt's just a mediocre "human" ...

ID=46603028
......

ID=46603029
Even I heard it, it is the most boring joke.

ID=46603030
That day I killed Catherine,\nI felt discomfort and anger that I can not feel in monsters.\n... It is impossible to forget even if you forget it.

ID=46603031
You are an undeniable "monster".\nI always wanted to be a figure.

ID=46603032
And, as I mentioned, I am already an ordinary "human".\nI can not become any more a monster, and I live in humiliating relationships with bounds.\n... It is such a miserable thing.

ID=46603033
Pull out your mouth ...!\nDo you now understand what you said ?! What?

ID=46603034
No matter if you do not wish for a new year, that power is crazy ...!\nIf you forget the madness and think that you are a human being, your strength will only weaken!

ID=46603035
It is a story that the power disappears at the same time as the madness that is the source of desire disappears ...

ID=46603036
That's it ...! And if you do not have that power you will die.

ID=46603037
Even if the power disappears, the pleasure for breaking up and fighting the battle will not disappear!\nIf you do that, you will not be able to fight properly either, will die ...

ID=46603038
Is that all right? I wonder if I lose my power as it is and I do not mind if it collapses without survival?

ID=46603039
It will not be long before dead?

ID=46603040
......

ID=46603041
I have stopped becoming a monster like you anymore.\nI decided to live a miserable life as a human being.

ID=46603042
Your madness is certainly a pleasant toy,\n... I do not need it anymore.

ID=46603043
Ah ...! Enough!\nI thought that I could not make myself understood, but I can not expect even more.

ID=46603044
There is no more for you, so please go home!\nThere is nothing to talk about! So, please disappear now!

ID=46603045
Yes. I will return today.

ID=46603046
But I do not think today is the last thing to come here.\nLook for other 'answers' for weak me to live,\nI will also tell you.

ID=46603047
answer ...? There is not such a thing.\nYou will gradually lose power and die.

ID=46603048
And along with you who will die altogether, I will also disappear.\nI can only wait here for that time ...

ID=46603049
Even if you regret it then it will be late ...\nStupid "human".

ID=66613001
Hahaha! Long time no see,%username%!\nI should have taken a vacation but I did not know that the fortress exploration is a hobby.

ID=66613002
There are personal requirements here.\nBesides that, Mr. Martin is really coming back and forth with the blank.

ID=66613003
I'm used to being overwhelmed by unreasonable work.\nWhen I become a commander at this age, from other commanders\nAll that is to be loved.

ID=66613004
"Young Starry Forrest Commander" often envies from around,\nActually it is just a position to be used conveniently by pressing miscellaneous affairs and responsibility.

ID=66613005
Totally ... unless I am a serious and responsible man\nI ran away a long time ago.

ID=66613006
... The day will come when the effort will be recognized someday.\nI hope we will not forget our patience in the future.

ID=66613007
Hahaha, if you say so to%username% you can not escape anymore.\nSeoul workers and experts will have similar positions.

ID=66613008
Well, my bitches were about this ... I told you personal requirements,\nSpecifically, what did you do?\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you could help me with my work.

ID=66613009
Do not worry. I do not have a hobby that deprives others of their achievements.

ID=66613010
It is not too late to have a hobby now.

ID=66613011
No thank you.

ID=66613012
... ... Yes.\nWell, I do not know the circumstances, but do your best.\nI am just in the business. Let's talk later.

ID=96613001
Oh, it's been a long time.\nHow about the blank search? Have you found anything?

ID=96613002
Even though it is blank, it was a particularly desolate place.\nAlthough it may be different from the viewpoint of scientists.

ID=96613003
Well, I guess I have to go directly after all.\nI will be able to go if the investigation of this fortress is over, but it is a pity.

ID=96613004
Apparently, I do not seem to be doing well in this research,\nWhy do not you investigate the blank first?

ID=96613005
I certainly think it is also one way,\nI do not want to throw out the research I started once until the end.\nFirst of all, energy of remaining energy in this Ruin Fortress\nI have to unlock the secret.

ID=96613006
It is a very passionate thing.\nUnfortunately the results do not seem to be.

ID=96613007
I can not deny it.\nThere is nothing ignorant and stupid as a scientist affirming that there is something unlikely to be "there".

ID=96613008
By the way, what have you done to Ruin Fortress?\nI heard that it is on vacation, but this place is not a recommended sightseeing spot.

ID=96613009
May I ask you a question first?\nWhat do you think of me?

ID=96613010
A tool that can be used?

ID=96613011
... .........................\n... Dangerous monsters and beasts you can not put your hands ... do not you think so?

ID=96613012
To met yourself like that ...\nSelf-evaluation on moderation is quite low for a long time.

ID=96613013
It is ... noisy ...!\nBecause I am seriously talking, will you answer seriously?

ID=96613014
I answer seriously.\n... Do you want to know if you think that you are a monster or a beast?

ID=96613015
Although you have seen places to chopise various things,\nI never directed the blade to humans.

ID=96613016
I can control myself with the reason that beasts can not possess,\nI wonder if the sense of justice is too strong to call a monster.

ID=96613017
After all, it is still a tool you can use "is not it?

ID=96613018
Hehe ... I'm kidding on rockstone. Do not seriously.\nTo be honest, Well ...

ID=96613019
A normal girl with a little too strong power, I wonder.

ID=96613020
... I did not think about that or even thought.

ID=96613021
You are too easy to call a monster.

ID=96613022
It faced me to save the crisis of the world.\nI am worried about the near soul workers a lot,\nI am fighting for everyone in the blank now.

ID=96613023
If there was a person who called a "monster" who dedicated so hard for the world ...\nIt is that way that I should say something.

ID=96613024
You said that you declared "tools" towards people.

ID=96613025
Hehe, I'm sorry.\nI was really joking, but I did not like that.

ID=96613026
But well, well ... I understood your opinion.

ID=96613027
I do not know why I am suffering from such a thing,\nDo not mind so much.\nI guarantee that you are not a "monster".

ID=96613028
...... Thank you.\nThanks to you, I was able to organize a little inside my heart.

ID=96613029
Well then, I will come to Amanda.\nThank you very much for taking the time out of your busy schedule.

ID=96613030
Sometimes I feel good.\nPlease talk to me if you have something again.

ID=86613001
Oh,%username% also came here.\nI heard that he is taking a holiday, are you resting properly?

ID=86613002
Although I thought that it was just boring,\nI enjoyed myself.

ID=86613003
Did you hear about it with Rocotown and Kandusity?

ID=86613004
As expected, soul workers are busy ....\nWell, I am also busy doing a blank investigation.

ID=86613005
Oh, that's what I wanted to tell%username%.\nI wonder if I have a little time.

ID=86613006
... Maybe, what about the near soul workers?

ID=86613007
Not at all, though ...\nIf it says one, it is information of the near soul worker project itself.

ID=86613008
I do not see any important content already discarded ...\nThere was some material that Mr. Hicks thought was created.

ID=86613009
A diary than a document ...? Perhaps it was better to say that memoir ...\nThe content is a little too shocking, I can not imagine Mr. Hick wrote.

ID=86613010
Could you tell me easily what kind of content?\nBecause there is not so much time to read carefully.

ID=86613011
I intended to do so.\nWell, I will summarize it as much as I can.

ID=86613012
You have chosen%username% to fight for yourself, do not you?\nThis person, no matter how many children passed away,\nI am satisfied with the result of my experiment. Such a person was.

ID=86613013
At first it seems that I felt guilty about using children for experiments,\nThe pleasures of getting results each time the experimental stage progresses out,\nShe seems to stop being stopped.

ID=86613014
It seems that the appearance of children seemed to be only an experimental body.\nEven when the first children died, than the state of their children\nIt was about the value on the screen I was concerned ....

ID=86613015
Eventually I did not feel guilty as a dust, it became a "monster" attached to the experiment.\nI do not care about others. It was a monster who just sought for his own enjoyment.

ID=86613016
"Monsters" who are captured by their own desires and do not feel anything ...\nIt closely resembles someone.

ID=86613017
In fact I also thought like%username%.

ID=86613018
A figure that enjoys feelings of guilt without feeling dust while mercilessly killing Vesh by abnormal blank.\nI know that it is for the world, but I was terrible because I was seriously happy.

ID=86613019
So what do you want to say to that one?\nA monster like me does not bother a human being any more,\nIs it a story that I want you to disappear somewhere?

ID=86613020
You have not finished talking yet, do you?\nThere is a continuation in the memoirs.

ID=86613021
......?

ID=86613022
... They were those who appeared in front of him who became a monster.\nAbel, Enoch, Noah ... and Laban.

ID=86613023
It was the first successful example for him who just failed until now.\nHicks seems to be starting to live together as their manager.

ID=86613024
... And from that time on, his world has been changed.

ID=86613025
Looking at the appearance that children who thought that it was just guinea pigs to be consumed laughed and cared for,\nI noticed that they were also willing people.

ID=86613026
... Surely the Near Soul Workers talk about what he has done\nI guess it was because I did not know anything.

ID=86613027
But for that reason a feeling of guilt was born in his dry heart,\nFrom the monster ... I think I was able to return to humans.

ID=86613028
I pulled a hand from a cruel experiment and tried to rescue the experimental children.\nI guess it was impossible to stop the experiment,\nEven so, I seem to have made a considerable effort to stop it.

ID=86613029
And it became that Hicks we know.

ID=86613030
...... I see.

ID=86613031
When I finished reading Mr. Hicks' memoir, I remembered%username%.\n%username% can always abandon my madness,\nYou might just not be doing so.

ID=86613032
... Of course,%username% who is fighting desperately still is just an extraordinary care.\nBut I wanted to tell you.

ID=86613033
Well, it is unnecessary care. You know well.\nIf you usually do not speak unnecessary things\nYou should have told me to do the work.

ID=86613034
Oh ... Hello ... I'm sorry ....

ID=86613035
But ... I will forgive you for today only.\nCoincidence or inevitability, the current story resolves my troubles\nIt might be a hint.

ID=86613036
Mr. Hicks who abandoned madness is the last figure.\nIf you think about that, you may get an answer.

ID=86613037
Prepare not to be a monster ... Let's try to talk to that "fools".

ID=86613038
I wish I had something useful.\nI thought that I was getting angry even unnecessary care ...

ID=46613001
How was the tour of "abandoned fortress"?

ID=46613002
It was surprisingly fun.\nI can not say I would like to visit again for flattery.

ID=46613003
Well, will we really want to try sight seeing?\nLet's sell hot cocoa at a price that is good for visitors coming to climb.

ID=36613001
As a shamefully fortified stronghold made by others, you can tell like that,\nI am impressed by passing the shock.

ID=36613002
No, it is such a cold and remote place ... no, isolated ...?\nOh well. Anyway, a hot drink is precious in such a place?

ID=36613003
Besides, it is a customer who ultimately makes a purchase decision.\nThis is rational based on the supply and demand rules ...

ID=16623001
... I'm not interested in your business design.\nI feel like it will appear soon,\nDid not you discover any big power?

ID=16623002
Oh, it sounds like I knew it.\nIt was just where my unconfirmed mighty power appeared around me and I was bothering my head.

ID=16623003
From inside the usual adult fortress, a mighty energy comparable to anomalous blanks was perceived.\nYou seem to have followed%username%.

ID=16623004
It is already the third time ....\nI thought it was just a coincidence when I was in Kandas city,\nIt seems that I definitely aim for myself.

ID=16623005
... I do not know how I am pursuing, but it was just right.\nLet 's suppose to go say a word to that fool this time too.

ID=16623006
What are you mumbling by myself?\n... Well, have you intended to help?

ID=16623007
However, I think I went ahead but I am a soldier on vacation ...

ID=16623008
I decide on my own how to spend my vacation.\nPlease stand there and look adult.

ID=16623009
... I will go without saying anything.\nI do not mind ... but the behavioral criteria of%username% is still not clear.

ID=16623010
The location of anomalous blanks will also be known to%username%.\nIt is a fortress that I have surveyed before.

ID=56623001
Well, I will go there.

ID=56623002
Oh, I beg you. Please be careful.

ID=26623001
I'm counting on you.

ID=46623001
Welcome back. It seems that it came back safely and nothing more than anything.\nIt seemed like I cleaned up the problem neatly and was saved.

ID=46623002
But ... did not anything happen?\nStrong energy sensed in it has disappeared ... It is strange.

ID=36623001
Yeah, there was nothing wrong, so I did not care about it.

ID=36623002
I see ... I got it.

ID=16633001
Let's not ask anything further inside.\nWell, there was not anything like a big problem ...?\nI do not mind believing%username%?

ID=16633002
Did you mention that there was nothing?

ID=16633003
Even if I look like this, I am responsible for the research team.\nI do not think that I can not see this degree.

ID=16633004
From the previous conversation about this anomaly blank search\nAs soon as I know something is secret.

ID=16633005
Hmm! Please stop prying uselessly.\nI am always seeking a fight ... is that so right?

ID=16633006
Well, I know the%username% battle favorite,\nI felt different this time this time.

ID=16633007
different from usual ...?

ID=16633008
That's true ... It is true that%username% likes battle.\nI have always been seeing that eyes shine every time I enter battle.

ID=16633009
However, this time I felt something more important than fighting.\nThe expression towards the office was also different from usual.

ID=16633010
... Can you tell me in detail what was wrong?

ID=16633011
... I do not want to feel bad, but%username% when I always go to battle is\nInnocence like a child and the cruelty of a beast Mixed like\nIt seemed to have a face full of purely murderous intent.

ID=16633012
I got accustomed to the murderous full of%username%\nOnly the expression when I went to the battle was really terrible even recently.

ID=16633013
... It is not strong. It is true.

ID=16633014
However,%username% when going to the office this time,\nIt was not murderous intent, it looked like a smile full of margin.\nI was surprised at that time.

ID=16633015
Smile ... I see ....

ID=16633016
... I do not know what changed the mind of%username% so far,\nPerhaps it will be personal, so let's not ask any more.

ID=16633017
However, only one. Recent%username% ... Well ...\nMore humane ...? I feel like I am becoming.

ID=16633018
The word human is not suitable for me.\n... If you used me before, you would say:

ID=16633019
But recently, I suspect that I am not a "monster"\nI was noticed.\nIt may be because of the change in facial expressions.

ID=16633020
Oh ... is that a nice thing?

ID=16633021
It seems that the power will weaken on the story I heard.\nIt might be a bad thing for the whole world.

ID=16633022
... Martin says that I was a monster\nDo you think it was good?

ID=16633023
Of course, it is a fact that it is troubled if%username% 's power weakens.\nIt may become a crisis not only for Starry Forrest but for the whole world.

ID=16633024
Still, I think that I am happy to change.\nIf it had been a "monster" all the time ...

ID=16633025
... a tragedy like a rebellion of a foreign competitor five years ago\nIt may have happened again.

ID=16633026
......

ID=16633027
Seoul workers are not tools or weapons to make combat advantageous.\nAlthough we temporarily suffered from human disasters of humanity due to the disaster of blank ...\nI want to think that it is not so now.

ID=16633028
%username% is a human being, our company.\nSo,%username% also do not think pessimistically about yourself.

ID=16633029
... Hmm!

ID=16633030
Such a story ... It makes me feel uncomfortable and irritated.\nBut I understood what Martin wanted to say.

ID=16633031
I am going already because I have personal business.\n... Thanks to you for letting a little say "fools".\nThank you very much.

ID=56633001
I do not know what it is, but better than anything else.\nOh, when you are finished, please report at least.

ID=26633001
Take care.

ID=66633001
It also brought a different 'fragments of desire' ...%username%.\nWould you also wish to step into your world this time?

ID=66633002
I will take care of you again.\nI think that it will be the last, so thank you.

ID=66633003
Huh ... I feel shinier than usual.\nYour history will surely shine with similar light.

ID=66633004
Pleasure to let your wishes come true.\nPlease wait a while and call on me again.

ID=66633005
I will follow if it is in order.

ID=96633001
Sorry I made you wait.\nPlease remove all the darkness you have in mind.

ID=96633002
Now is the time to stand up again.\nA new history that can not be predicted will appear before you.\nI am looking forward to it.

ID=96633003
I know enough.

ID=96633004
There is no need to hurry.\nAlthough it is a little by little, the history is engraved securely.

ID=96633005
I pray that your path will be the right history.

ID=46633001
Are you doing well?\nI have come back.

ID=46633002
Hmm ...\nI do not have time to spend more meaningless conversations with you.

ID=46633003
Huhu, you stopped a polite phrase?\nIt is ugly to see the disgusted appearance.

ID=46633004
Do you use polite expressions for insects and grasses?

ID=46633005
Are you planning to treat me as a worm?

ID=46633006
I did not notice the circumstances I was given,\nIs not such a treatment enough for those who do not listen to advice?

ID=46633007
Well, I do not mind.\nBecause this time it will be my one-sided preaching.

ID=46633008
I do not know where I'm confident,\n"Imprisoner" who does not know anything is in a state.

ID=46633009
"Impostor" ... First of all it will not make it clear.\nOn what grounds do you treat me as a 'fake?'\nCould you explain it?

ID=46633010
... Who told you that%username% · Bloom fairy tale is a monster.

ID=46633011
And yet, I pretend to be a human ... ...?\nIt's a pity! I do not remember what I was doing until now?

ID=46633012
You are determined to continue fighting from now on.

ID=46633013
Yes. I have not told you a word to quit the battle until now.

ID=46633014
Just leave everything to madness and rampage.\nFulfill your life as a monster as you have done so far.

ID=46633015
Have you ever enjoyed slaughter ruthlessly?\nI am not qualified to have an ordinary life either.

ID=46633016
Give up living as a human.\nKilling many things as a monster from now on ...\nThat's all for you!

ID=46633017
Have you never thought of fighting as a human?

ID=46633018
How to fight for you is not that of human beings.\nUnless you stop fighting, you can not be human.\nI was stupid enough to understand such simple things.

ID=46633019
No ... Even if you are, I am different.\nThere are definitely different points between me and you.

ID=46633020
... It is about the value of life.\nTo put it more, how do you think about your own life?

ID=46633021
Hmm! I say what it is.\nThe value of life? What does that mean?

ID=46633022
For you, life is not worth being consumed in battle.\nThat's it, is not it?

ID=46633023
However, I have learned that it has a little value in my life.\nUntil then I thought it would be fine if I could die on the battlefield,\nI can see that my mind is about to change.

ID=46633024
With that idea only you can see the future that will die.\nYou live desperately to protect lives like garbage?

ID=46633025
I've crushed myself unconditionally,\nHe said that he would become an insect himself that would scratch himself to live ...?\nDo not be silly ...!

ID=46633026
Do not worry.\nI have no intention of becoming insects.

ID=46633027
However ... unlike you you are not interested in your life ...\nAs a human being, I fight a bit in a human fighting way.

ID=46633028
Human fighting way ...?\nIs it possible to do such a thing?

ID=46633029
Besides leaving to madness and killing ...\nHow are you going to fight?

ID=46633030
I will dedicate my life to the battle.

ID=46633031
To protect many valuable lives, and to survive oneself.\nI will fight with all my strength with "preparing" to lose this life.

ID=46633032
It may sound like a contradiction.\nIt will not change that it is the life that disappears at the end of the endless fight.

ID=46633033
Still ... this life that defends and fights worthy lives,\nFrom your life which is exhausted without any meaning\nDo not you think it is worth much?

ID=46633034
From now on you can crawl freely to survive,\nYou will also run around without fail.\nUnlike you who are trying to fight until you die,\nThat figure may seem miserable.

ID=46633035
Still, what it needs to make it come true.\nMy belief to help people and live as human beings.

ID=46633036
When going to the battle, I am ready to take a life.\nReady for a more meaningful, valuable fight ....

ID=46633037
......

ID=46633038
Huh ... Hahaha ... Ahahahahaha!

ID=46633039
... I see.\nMadness etc ... It is not necessary anymore ...

ID=46633040
You already found a crazy "substitute\\nHuh ... I did not notice such a thing, somehow I tried to round it\nDoes that mean I was stupid?

ID=46633041
No matter how beautifully spoken it, will you end up running away to life?\nEscape from the enemy by aristocracy etc ... Do you have no pride at all?

ID=46633042
Just putting your legs forward does not allow you to dance good.\nSometimes I do not draw back.

ID=46633043
Ahahahaha! ! !\nAs usual you seem to be good at word play ...

ID=46633044
Far from being unable to talk, there is no way I can save it anymore ...\n... Well, even if it continues to fight even if "now" is OK with this.

ID=46633045
You should live as you like.\nI pray that the man who threw madness can keep that miserable life long even in one second.

ID=46633046
What kind of "death worth doing" boasts of pride ...\n... I will look forward to it.

ID=36633001
... Yeah.\nI will give it to survive.

ID=36633002
When you die you decide yourself so do not worry.

ID=63314015
My job is to investigate the interior of the base and secure the safest route.\nIt may not be a researcher any more, you should ask a hacker.
